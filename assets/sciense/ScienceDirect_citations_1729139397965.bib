abstract = {Introduction: Computational methods have been widely applied to toxicology across pharmaceutical, consumer product and environmental fields over the past decade. Progress in computational toxicology is now reviewed. Methods: A literature review was performed on computational models for hepatotoxicity (e.g. for drug-induced liver injury (DILI)), cardiotoxicity, renal toxicity and genotoxicity. In addition various publications have been highlighted that use machine learning methods. Several computational toxicology model datasets from past publications were used to compare Bayesian and Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning methods. Results: The increasing amounts of data for defined toxicology endpoints have enabled machine learning models that have been increasingly used for predictions. It is shown that across many different models Bayesian and SVM perform similarly based on cross validation data. Discussion: Considerable progress has been made in computational toxicology in a decade in both model development and availability of larger scale or ‘big data’ models. The future efforts in toxicology data generation will likely provide us with hundreds of thousands of compounds that are readily accessible for machine learning models. These models will cover relevant chemistry space for pharmaceutical, consumer product and environmental applications.}

The ability to infer intentions of other agents, called theory of mind (ToM), confers strong advantages for individuals in social situations. Here, we show that ToM can also be maladaptive when people interact with complex modern institutions like financial markets. We tested participants who were investing in an experimental bubble market, a situation in which the price of an asset is much higher than its underlying fundamental value. We describe a mechanism by which social signals computed in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex affect value computations in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, thereby increasing an individual’s propensity to ‘ride’ financial bubbles and lose money. These regions compute a financial metric that signals variations in order flow intensity, prompting inference about other traders’ intentions. Our results suggest that incorporating inferences about the intentions of others when making value judgments in a complex financial market could lead to the formation of market bubbles.}

Our examples often involve the discussion of cognitive agents in highway traffic models. A cognitive agent is an agent capable of performing cognitive acts, i.e. a sequence of the following activities: “Perceiving” information in the environment and provided by other agents, “Reasoning” about this information using existing knowledge, “Judging” the obtained information using existing knowledge, “Responding” to other cognitive agents or to the external environment, as it may be required, and “Learning”, i.e. changing (and, hopefully augmenting) the existing knowledge if the newly acquired information allows it. We describe how computational intelligence techniques (e.g., fuzzy logic, neural networks, genetic algorithms, etc) allow mimicking to a certain extent the cognitive acts performed by human beings. The order with which the cognitive actions take place is important and so is the order with which the various computational intelligence techniques are applied. We believe that a hierarchical layered model should be defined for the generic cognitive agents in a style akin to the hierarchical OSI 7 layer model used in data communication. We outline in broad sense such a reference model.}

How to cater to the keen interest in OS among students across all universities while providing a rich system software engineering experience? Engaging the OS community on campus plays a pivotal role in enhancing undergraduate education. Our institution has implemented a novel approach over the past nine years through the miniOS pilot class initiative. This program allows students enrolled in the OS course to opt into an additional, practical component where they engage in developing the OS kernel using miniOS, our teaching platform. Participants dedicate their spare time to a series of labs aimed at incrementally introducing them to miniOS, collaborate on a project to add a new functional module to miniOS, and ultimately present their work in a formal defense. This hands-on experience supplements the theoretical coursework, with the notable advantage that pilot class participants are exempt from the traditional final exam. Instead, their grade is determined by their contributions to the pilot class, with distinguished projects being integrated into the evolving miniOS kernel—a witness to the collective effort of each class. Since its inception in 2015, the miniOS pilot class has nurtured 182 undergraduates and 22 graduate students, contributing significantly to the OS community engagement on campus. Through this initiative, we have gleaned six key insights and six lessons, which we are eager to share with the broader educational community.}

In this study we use the computational experiment as an integration of the computational science with the discovery learning method. The computational experiment supports both types of research, the exploratory as well as the inventive research, helping the learners to develop not only exploratory but also expressive models. The aim of the paper is threefold. At first we want to examine the influence of the computational experiment on students’ learning performance. The other two aims are related to the investigation of the experiment’s influence on students’ approach to learning and their beliefs on physics. Our results indicate that there is a strong shift on students’ conceptual understanding and to the consideration of the coherence of physics, as well as to the realization that physics is strongly connected to mathematics. Finally students realized that mathematics, physics and information theory are strongly connected cognitive disciplines.}

A formal model is introduced that allows for studying the details of playing a serious game under diverse conditions. The dynamics of player action and motivation is based on cognitive flow theory, which is expressed in quantitative terms for this purpose. Seven extensive simulation studies involving over 100,000 iterations have demonstrated the stability of the model and its potential as a research instrument for serious gaming. The model allows researchers to deeply investigate quantitative dependences between relevant game variables, gain deeper understanding of how people learn from games, and develop approaches to improving serious game design.}

We test, for the first time, whether Bayesian reasoning can be elicited in children by means of natural frequencies. We show that when information was presented to fourth, fifth, and sixth graders in terms of probabilities, their ability to estimate the Bayesian posterior probability was zero. Yet when the same information was presented in natural frequencies, Bayesian reasoning showed a steady increase from fourth to sixth grade, reaching an average level of 19, 39, and 53%, respectively, in two studies. Sixth graders' performance with natural frequencies matched the performance of adults with probabilities. But this general increase was accompanied by striking individual differences. More than half of the sixth graders solved most or all problems, whereas one third could not solve a single one. An analysis of the children's responses provides evidence for the use of three non-Bayesian strategies. These follow an overlapping wave model of development and continue to be observed in the minds of adults. More so than adults' probabilistic reasoning, children's reasoning depends on a proper representation of information.}

In particular, we select classes of graphs according to their number of vertices and their domination number and encode the conjecture as an ideal/polynomial pair such that the polynomial is non-negative on the variety associated with the ideal if and only if the conjecture is true for this graph class. Using semidefinite programming we obtain numeric sum-of-squares certificates, which we then manage to transform into symbolic certificates confirming non-negativity of our polynomials. Specifically, we obtain exact low-degree sparse sum-of-squares certificates for particular classes of graphs. The obtained certificates allow generalizations for larger graph classes. Besides computational verification of these more general certificates, we also present theoretical proofs as well as conjectures and questions for further investigations.}

abstract = {Contemporary methods of computational cognitive modeling have recently been criticized by Addyman and French (2012) on the grounds that they have not kept up with developments in computer technology and human–computer interaction. They present a manifesto for change according to which, it is argued, modelers should devote more effort to making their models accessible, both to non-modelers (with an appropriate easy-to-use user interface) and modelers alike. We agree that models, like data, should be freely available according to the normal standards of science, but caution against confusing implementations with specifications. Models may embody theories, but they generally also include implementation assumptions. Cognitive modeling methodology needs to be sensitive to this. We argue that specification, replication and experimentation are methodological approaches that can address this issue.}

Its existence is supported by numerous theoretical, computational, and experimental findings in different species. However, I argue that recent evidence from single-neuron recordings suggests that pattern separation may not be present in the human hippocampus and that memories are instead coded by the coactivation of invariant and context-independent engrams. This alternative model prompts a reassessment of the definition of episodic memory and its distinction from semantic memory. Furthermore, I propose that a lack of pattern separation in memory coding may have profound implications that could explain cognitive abilities that are uniquely developed in humans, such as our power of generalization and of creative and abstract thinking.}

To study this rhetorical activity, we build on four overlapping traditions of digital writing research in computers and composition that inform how we frame literacies, how we study social media rhetorics, how we engage iteratively and reflexively with methodologies and technologies, and how we blend computational methods with qualitative methods. Drawing on these four traditions, our paper shows our iterative research process through which we gathered and analyzed a dataset of 32,000 posts (formerly known as tweets) from X (formerly Twitter) about prompt writing posted between November 2022 to May 2023. We present five themes about these emerging AI literacy practices: (1) areas of communication impacted by prompt writing, (2) micro-literacy resources shared for prompt writing, (3) market rhetoric shaping prompt writing, (4) rhetorical characteristics of prompts, and (5) definitions of prompt writing. In discussing these themes and our methodologies, we highlight takeaways for digital writing teachers and researchers who are teaching and analyzing critical AI literacies.}

abstract = {The mammalian cerebral cortex is characterized by intense spontaneous activity, depending on brain region, age, and behavioral state. Classically, the cortex is considered as being driven by the senses, a paradigm which corresponds well to experiments in quiescent or deeply anesthetized states. In awake animals, however, the spontaneous activity cannot be considered as ‘background noise’, but is of comparable—or even higher—amplitude than evoked sensory responses. Recent evidence suggests that this internal activity is not only dominant, but also it shares many properties with the responses to natural sensory inputs, suggesting that the spontaneous activity is not independent of the sensory input. Such evidence is reviewed here, with an emphasis on intracellular and computational aspects. Statistical measures, such as the spike-triggered average of synaptic conductances, show that the impact of internal network state on spiking activity is major in awake animals. Thus, cortical activity cannot be considered as being driven by the senses, but sensory inputs rather seem to modulate and modify the internal dynamics of cerebral cortex. This view offers an attractive interpretation not only of dreaming activity (absence of sensory input), but also of several mental disorders.}

CMP teachers were more than three times as likely to implement high-level instructional tasks than non-CMP teachers. Increases in the cognitive demand were associated with enhanced growth rates in problem solving, computation, and equation solving. Notably, when controlling for the cognitive demand of the instructional tasks, the advantage of the CMP curriculum over the non-CMP curricula on students’ growth in problem solving disappeared. However, non-CMP curricula had an advantage on students’ growth over the CMP curriculum after the cognitive demand of the instructional tasks was controlled.}

abstract = {The benefits of applying multi-objective optimization (MOO) in building design have been increasingly recognized in recent decades. The existing or traditional computational design optimization (CDO) approaches mostly focus on optimization problem solving (OPS), as they often conduct optimizations directly by assuming the optimization problems in question are good enough. In contrast, the computational design exploration (CDE) approaches defined in this research mainly focus on optimization problem formulation (OPF), which are considered more essential and aim to achieve or ensure appropriate optimization problems before conducting optimizations. However, the application of the CDE is very limited especially in conceptual architectural design. The necessity of re-formulating original optimization problems and its potential impacts on optimization results are often overlooked or not emphasized enough. This paper proposes a new CDE approach that highlights the knowledge-supported re-formulation of a changeable initial optimization problem. It improves upon the traditional CDO approach by introducing a changeable initial OPF and inserting a CDE module. The changeable initial OPF allows expanding the dimensionality of an objective space and design space being investigated, and the CDE module can re-formulate the changeable optimization problem using the information and knowledge extracted from statistical analyses. To facilitate designers in achieving the proposed approach, an improved computational platform is used which combines parametric modeling software (including simulation plug-ins) and design optimization software. Assisted by the platform, the proposed approach is applied to the conceptual design of an indoor sports building that considers multi-disciplinary performance criteria (including architecture-, climate- and structure-related criteria) and a wide range of geometric variations. Through the case study, this paper demonstrates the use of the proposed approach, verifies its benefits over the traditional method, and unveils the factors that may affect the behaviour of the proposed approach. Besides, it also shows the suitability of the computational platform used.}

This activation of visual areas may highlight the functional flexibility of occipital regions deprived of their dominant inputs or relate to the intrinsic computational role of specific occipital regions. We contrasted these competing hypotheses by characterizing the brain activity of CB and sighted participants while performing subtraction, multiplication and a control letter task. In both groups, subtraction selectively activated a bilateral dorsal network commonly activated during spatial processing. Multiplication triggered activity in temporal regions thought to participate in memory retrieval. No between-group difference was observed for the multiplication task whereas subtraction induced enhanced activity in the right dorsal occipital cortex of the blind individuals only. As this area overlaps with regions showing selective tuning to auditory spatial processing and exhibits increased functional connectivity with a dorsal “spatial” network, our results suggest that the recruitment of occipital regions during high-level cognition in the blind actually relates to the intrinsic computational role of the activated regions.}

A model of conscious attention based on the theory of dynamic core hypothesis is first outlined, followed by a computational model that mimics key stages of the conscious attention process. Convolutional neural networks serve as a basis for modeling perceptual categorization and concept formation through automatic feature extraction, due to their analogy with the processes of neural group selection and reentry in the brain. Further, the process of incremental learning and its impact on signal novelty are modeled via transfer learning. The model is tested on the NASA C-MAPSS turbofan engine model, which indicated 95–99% fault diagnosis accuracy.

Participants’ AUT and CRRAT scores in the above two modes were collected to analyze the moderating effects of connective efficiency (CE). The results showed that the relationship between originality performance in the single- and paired-player modes was moderated by four theoretical graph measures. Specifically, in the case of a high clustering coefficient, local efficiency, global efficiency, or low characteristic path length, individual originality performance was more predictive of interactive originality. Additionally, the relationship between fluency performance in the above two modes was not moderated by CE, flexibility, or CRRAT performance. This study identified the effects of neural transmission efficiency on the relationship between creativity in the two modes. This study investigated neurocognitive factors influencing creativity performance in interactive situations.}

Drawing on the sociocultural theory of learning and participation, this case study explored how six very young children taught and explored Google’s Teachable Machine in nonschool settings. Through fine-grained analysis of video recordings and interviews with the children, the article illustrates the content and the process of teaching where 3–9 year old children were producing machine learning data sets and models as well as observing, exploring, and explaining their own interaction with machine learning systems. The results illustrate the quick-paced and embodied nature of the child-computer interaction that also supported children to reason about the relationship between their own bodily expressions and the output of an interactive ML-based tool. The article concludes with discussions on the emergent process of teaching and learning as well as on ways of promoting children’s participation and sense of agency in the age of machine learning.}

abstract = {Purpose
This paper examines how mathematics teacher educators (MTEs) learn to enact equitable mathematics instruction using technology through lesson study (LS).
Design/methodology/approach
A LS team with three MTEs conducted three iterations of LS on teaching the Pythagorean Theorem in an in-person, technology-mediated environment. Many forms of data were collected: Desmos activities, videos of research lessons (RLs), videos of MTE RL debriefings, artifacts of student learning in the Desmos Dashboard, and MTEs' written self-reflection. The authors investigate the teacher educators' learning through LS by analyzing the MTE debriefings of the RLs using Bannister’s (2015) framework for teacher learning in communities of practice.
Findings
The MTEs learned to enact equitable mathematics instruction using technology through addressing emerging issues related to intellectual authority and use of student thinking. Throughout the LS, the MTEs sought ways of promoting students' mathematical authority and using student thinking through features of the Desmos platform.
Research limitations/implications
This study focuses on MTEs' learning without examining participating preservice teachers' learning. It demonstrates the benefits of LS for MTEs' professional learning.
Practical implications
This study showcases how a research-based Desmos activity is used and refined to promote MTE learning how to implement equitable mathematics instruction.
Originality/value
The study contributes to better understanding of how LS could be used to develop MTEs' professional learning. Moreover, the dual process of participation and reification was concretized through diagnostic and prognostic frames in the LS context, which enriches the concept of community of practice.}

abstract = {Cervical spine injuries continue to be a costly societal problem. Future advancements in injury prevention depend on improved physical and computational models, which are predicated on a better understanding of the neck response during dynamic loading. Previous studies have shown that the tolerance of the neck is dependent on its initial position and its buckling behavior. This study uses a computational model to examine three important factors hypothesized to influence the loads experienced by vertebrae in the neck under compressive impact: muscle activation, torso constraints, and pre-flexion angle of the cervical spine. Since cadaver testing is not practical for large scale parametric analyses, these factors were studied using a previously validated computational model. On average, simulations with active muscles had 32% larger compressive forces and 25% larger shear forces—well in excess of what was expected from the muscle forces alone. In the short period of time required for neck injury, constraints on torso motion increased the average neck compression by less than 250N. The pre-flexion hypothesis was tested by examining pre-flexion angles from neutral (0°) to 64°. Increases in pre-flexion resulted in the largest increases in peak loads and the expression of higher-order buckling modes. Peak force and buckling modality were both very sensitive to pre-flexion angle. These results validate the relevance of prior cadaver models for neck injury and help explain the wide variety of cervical spine fractures that can result from ostensibly similar compressive loadings. They also give insight into the mechanistic differences between burst fractures and lower cervical spine dislocations.}

Neurophysiological investigations of backward masking show that the threshold for conscious visual perception may be set to be higher than the level at which small but significant information is present in neuronal firing and which allows humans to guess which stimulus was shown without conscious awareness. The adaptive value of this may be that the systems in the brain that implement the type of information processing involved in conscious thoughts are not interrupted by small signals that could be noise in sensory pathways. I then consider what computational processes are closely related to conscious processing, and describe a higher order syntactic thought (HOST) computational theory of consciousness. It is argued that the adaptive value of higher order thoughts is to solve the credit assignment problem that arises if a multistep syntactic plan needs to be corrected. It is then suggested that it feels like something to be an organism that can think about its own linguistic, and semantically-based thoughts. It is suggested that qualia, raw sensory and emotional feels, arise secondarily to having evolved such a higher order thought system, and that sensory and emotional processing feels like something because it would be unparsimonious for it to enter the planning, higher order thought, system and not feel like something.}

abstract = {Computational thinking and coding for children are attracting increasing attention. There are several efforts around the globe to implement coding frameworks for children, and there is a need to develop an empirical knowledge base of methods and tools. One major problem for integrating study results into a common body of knowledge is the relatively limited measurements applied, and the relation of the widely used self-reporting methods with more objective measurements, such as biophysical ones. In this study, eye-tracking activity was used to measure children’s learning and activity indicators. The goal of the study is to utilize eye-tracking to understand children’s activity while they learn how to code and to investigate any potential association between children’s attitudes and their gaze. In this contribution, we designed an experiment with 44 children (between 8 and 17 years old) who participated in a full-day construction-based coding activity. We recorded their gaze while they were working and captured their attitudes in relation to their learning, excitement and intention. The results showed a significant relation between children’s attitudes (what they think about coding) and their gaze patterns (how they behaved during coding). Eye-tracking data provide initial insights into the behaviour of children, for example if children have difficulty in extracting information or fail to accomplish an expected task. Therefore, further studies need to be conducted to shed additional light on children’s experience and learning duringcoding.}

The system in question interacts with attackers of different levels of intelligence, each employing different feedback controllers against the system. Principles of behavioral game theory – specifically the concept of level-k thinking – is employed to construct a database of potential attack vectors. By observing the state trajectories under sequential interactions with different adversaries, the defender adaptively estimates both the number and profiles of the different attack signals using an online deterministic annealing approach. This information is used to dynamically estimate the level of intelligence of the attackers. Simulation results showcase the efficacy of the proposed method.}

abstract = {Impaired Semantic Verbal Fluency (SVF) in dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and its precursor Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is well known. Yet, it remains open whether this impairment mirrors the breakdown of semantic memory retrieval processes or executive control processes. Therefore, qualitative analysis of the SVF has been proposed but is limited in terms of methodology and feasibility in clinical practice. Consequently, research draws no conclusive picture which of these afore-mentioned processes drives the SVF impairment in AD and MCI. This study uses a qualitative computational approach—combining temporal and semantic information—to investigate exploitation and exploration patterns as indicators for semantic memory retrieval and executive control processes. Audio SVF recordings of 20 controls (C, 66–81 years), 55 MCI (57–94 years) and 20 AD subjects (66–82 years) were assessed while groups were matched according to age and education. All groups produced, on average, the same amount of semantically related items in rapid succession within word clusters. Conversely, towards AD, there was a clear decline in semantic as well as temporal exploration patterns between clusters. Results strongly point towards preserved exploitation—semantic memory retrieval processes—and hampered exploration—executive control processes—in AD and potentially in MCI.}

In order to tackle the issue, we at first describe a striking correlation between Wittgenstein's Tractatus, that assesses the syntactic relationships between language and world, and Perlovsky's joint language-cognitive computational model, that assesses the semantic relationships between emotions and “knowledge instinct”. Once established a correlation between a purely logical approach to the language and computable psychological activities, we aim to find the neural correlates of syntax and semantics in the human brain. Starting from topological arguments, we suggest that the semantic properties of a proposition are processed in higher brain's functional dimensions than the syntactic ones. In a fully reversible process, the syntactic elements embedded in Broca's area project into multiple scattered semantic cortical zones. The presence of higher functional dimensions gives rise to the increase in informational content that takes place in semantic expressions. Therefore, diverse features of human language and cognitive world can be assessed in terms of both the logic armor described by the Tractatus, and the neurocomputational techniques at hand. One of our motivations is to build a neuro-computational framework able to provide a feasible explanation for brain's semantic processing, in preparation for novel computers with nodes built into higher dimensions.}

Though the starting barrier is low, fundamental concepts are still required in order to manage the technicalities of the engineering environment and everyday computational systems. In 1967, Logo proposed to teach abstract programming concepts by providing a set of functions that had intuitive, visible effects over a robotic Turtle. LOGO was a success, but the robots quickly migrated into computer simulations. From LOGO, many followed. Scratch and Lego Mindstorm are some of the most notorious examples. Both introduced graphical block-based programming interfaces. We propose to bring back the powerful ideas behind LOGO by updating it with state of the art technologies. Phogo combines Python, Arduino and 3D printing into a low cost robot that is easy to build and control. The robot has a pen to draw shapes and can be commanded from a computer via a wireless link that is transparent to the students. The use of a physical robot can make programming more accessible for students with disabilities. The open and maker philosophies behind Phogo makes it more interesting as students will be able to access and study the electronic components. The textual programing language can be a long life companion for the students. In this work we discuss LOGO and other projects inspired by it, and we also share the methodology and design decisions behind Phogo, the results of its application in a workshop and the improvements we are currently developing.}

In this paper, we present the concept of Constraint Local Principal Curve (CLPC), which uses local optimization methods and restricts the principal curve with two fixed endpoints to reduce the computational complexity. In addition, we propose three CLPC algorithms by Local Optimization and Adaptive Radius to expand the range of applications and increase the solution quality. The first algorithm, i.e., CLPCg is based on greedy thinking. The second algorithm, i.e., CLPCs uses one dimensional search and the last algorithm CLPCc combines the greedy thinking and one dimensional search. Then, we define six performance indices to evaluate the performance of the CLPC algorithms. Finally, we present some numerical experiments with three simulation data sets and two GPS measured data sets in both highway and railway. The results indicate that all of the three CLPC algorithms can obtain high-accuracy data from multiple low-accuracy data efficiently. The CLPC algorithms can improve the accuracy and computational speed compared with the existing K-segment principal curve (KPC) algorithm. In addition, CLPCc outperforms CLPCg and CLPCs according to the comprehensive experiments while CLPCg runs much faster than other ones.}

abstract = {In constructivist principles, learning is a process in which individuals construct knowledge. Research in Mathematics Education looks for ways to make mathematics education less dry and more attractive. When solving polynomial equations of the first degree, it is very common for teachers to work with the mistaken idea of “changing the sign” when “moving” the member. To minimize this problem, a balance can be used to illustrate the idea of equilibrium and also properties of equality. The objectives of this study were (1) develop a computational tool to replace a conventional balance in practical mathematics exercises thereby solving two material challenges for Brazilian teachers: verifying the accuracy of balances and the lack of student physical and social activity through direct participation; (2) determine how substituting the conventional balance with a computational tool for the solution of first degree polynomial equations affected the aspects inherent in the learning process like motivation, cooperation, dialogue, discussion, reflection, reciprocity, negotiation and responsibility. The results indicate that the cognitive computational tool met the challenges of Brazilian teachers. First, because it lacks mechanisms that need to be verified for accuracy in order to demonstrate equilibrium. Second, because it allows the direct participation of students (physical experience) and the use of the tool in small groups (social experience). The hands on completion of the activity, realistic appearance, the interaction with the tool, visual feedback on the panel, and two students using the same tool awakened motivation, responsibility for completing the activity, dialogue, cooperation, discussion and reflection. Doing the experiment with others aroused concern about the learning of others and reciprocity of knowledge for the improvement of the procedure to be constructed for solving 1st degree equations.}

Here, we use examples to show that models can serve a wide variety of roles, including hypothesis testing, generating new insights, deepening understanding, suggesting and interpreting experiments, tracing chains of causation, doing sensitivity analyses, integrating knowledge, and inspiring new approaches. We show that models can bring together information of different kinds and do so across a range of length scales, as they do in multi-scale, multi-faceted embryogenesis models, some of which connect gene expression, the cytoskeleton, cell properties, tissue mechanics, morphogenetic movements and phenotypes. Models cannot replace experiments nor can they prove that particular mechanisms are at work in a given situation. But they can demonstrate whether or not a proposed mechanism is sufficient to produce an observed phenomenon. Although the examples in this article are taken primarily from the field of embryo mechanics, most of the arguments and discussion are applicable to any form of computational modelling.}

To verify the correctness and usefulness of this method, the abilities of 407 college students who solved 61 physics problems in a Web-based learning environment were estimated from the log files of the learning environment. The reduced chi-squared statistic and Pearson’s chi-square test for the goodness of fit indicate that the estimated abilities were able to successfully explain the observed problem solving performance of students within error. The educational implications of estimating the ability of students in Web-based learning environments were also discussed.}

abstract = {The neocortex plays a crucial role in all basic and abstract cognitive functions. Conscious mental processes are achieved through a correct flow of information within and across neocortical networks, whose particular activity state results from a tight balance between excitation and inhibition. The proper equilibrium between these indissoluble forces is operated with multiscale organization: along the dendro–somatic axis of single neurons and at the network level. Fast synaptic inhibition is assured by a multitude of inhibitory interneurons. During cortical activities, these cells operate a finely tuned division of labor that is epitomized by their detailed connectivity scheme. Recent results combining the use of mouse genetics, cutting-edge optical and neurophysiological approaches have highlighted the role of fast synaptic inhibition in driving cognition-related activity through a canonical cortical circuit, involving several major interneuron subtypes and principal neurons. Here we detail the organization of this cortical blueprint and we highlight the crucial role played by different neuron types in fundamental cortical computations. In addition, we argue that this canonical circuit is prone to many variations on the theme, depending on the resolution of the classification of neuronal types, and the cortical area investigated. Finally, we discuss how specific alterations of distinct inhibitory circuits can underlie several devastating brain diseases.}

abstract = {Language understanding and mathematics understanding are two fundamental forms of human thinking. Prior research has largely focused on the question of how language shapes mathematical thinking. The current study considers the converse question. Specifically, it investigates whether the magnitude representations that are thought to anchor understanding of number are also recruited to understand the meanings of graded words. These are words that come in scales (e.g., Anger) whose members can be ordered by the degree to which they possess the defining property (e.g., calm, annoyed, angry, furious). Experiment 1 uses the comparison paradigm to find evidence that the distance, ratio, and boundary effects that are taken as evidence of the recruitment of magnitude representations extend from numbers to words. Experiment 2 uses a similarity rating paradigm and multi-dimensional scaling to find converging evidence for these effects in graded word understanding. Experiment 3 evaluates an alternative hypothesis – that these effects for graded words simply reflect the statistical structure of the linguistic environment – by using machine learning models of distributional word semantics: LSA, word2vec, GloVe, counterfitted word vectors, BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2. These models fail to show the full pattern of effects observed of humans in Experiment 2, suggesting that more is needed than mere statistics. This research paves the way for further investigations of the role of magnitude representations in sentence and text comprehension, and of the question of whether language understanding and number understanding draw on shared or independent magnitude representations. It also informs the role of machine learning models in cognitive psychology research.}

abstract = {Appraisal theories of emotion argue that emotions arise from a process of comparing individual needs and concerns to external demands. That is, emotions cannot be explained by solely focusing on the environment or by solely focusing on the individual. Rather, they reflect an individual’s subjective assessment of their relation to the environment. Appraisal theories further posit this relationship is characterized by the individual (appraised) in terms of a set of criteria, variously called appraisal variables, checks, or dimensions; for example, Is an event congruent with a person’s goals or concerns?; Who or what caused it?; Was it unexpected?; and What control does the person have over its unfolding? The results of these appraisal checks are in turn mapped to emotion. In this chapter, we do not explore appraisal as a theory of emotion elicitation. Rather, we suggest appraisal theories, specifically the criteria that appraisal theories posit, provide a useful framework for characterizing how situations are perceived by a person and influence their behavior. We go on to suggest that computational models of appraisal can provide a clear specification of how these criteria are assessed. Furthermore, such models can help us explore the dynamics of the person-environment relation, specifically how changes in the environment as well as changes in the person’s perceptions and behavior arise and induce those dynamics.}

In the development of the methods targeting this class of problems, the computational challenges involved need to be addressed in such a way that 3D computation of complex applications can be carried out efficiently on parallel computers. This requirement has to be one of the key factors in designing various components of the overall solution approach, such as solution techniques for the discretized equations and mesh update methods for handling the changes in the spatial domain occupied by the fluid. This overview includes a description of how the computational challenges are addressed and how the computational schemes can be enhanced with special preconditioning techniques.}

Declarative programming techniques, where algorithms are derived from a specification of the desired behavior, offer hope to address this problem, since there is a combinatorial reduction in complexity in programming in terms of specifications instead of algorithms, and arbitrary desired properties can be expressed and enforced in specifications directly. However, limitations on performance have prevented programming with declarative specifications from becoming a mainstream technique for general-purpose programming, because a strategy which is both efficient and fully general to derive algorithms from specifications does not yet exist. To address this bottleneck, I propose information-gain computation, a framework where an adaptive evaluation strategy is used to efficiently perform a search which derives algorithms that provide information about a query via the most efficient routes. Within this framework, opportunities to compress the search space present themselves, which suggest that information-theoretic bounds on the performance of such a system might be articulated and a system might be designed to achieve them. The computation of the information measures that are the basis of this strategy crucially depends on a probabilistic semantics for the relations represented by predicates, which may either already be present in a probabilistic logic language, or may be superimposed on a pure logic language. I describe a prototype implementation of Fifth, a system that implements these techniques, and a preliminary empirical study of adaptive evaluation for a simple test program. In the test, the evaluation strategy adapts successfully to efficiently evaluate a query with pathological features that would prevent its evaluation by standard general-purpose strategies.}

As our illustrative example, we choose a specific numerical task (the detection of stability boundaries in parameter space) for stochastic models of two simplified heterogeneous catalytic reaction mechanisms. In the equation-free framework the stochastic simulator is treated as an experiment (albeit a computational one). Short bursts of fine scale simulation (short computational experiments) are designed, executed, and their outputs processed and fed back to the process, in integrated protocols aimed at performing the particular coarse-grained task (the detection of a macroscopic instability). Two distinct approaches are presented; one is a direct translation of our previous protocol for adaptive detection of instabilities in laboratory experiments [Rico-Martinez, R., Krisher, K., Flatgen, G., Anderson, J. S., & Kevrekidis, I. G. (2003). Adaptive detection of instabilities: An experimental feasibility study. Physica D, 176, 1–18]; the second approach is motivated from numerical bifurcation algorithms for critical point detection.

The computational architecture of cortex, for example, is very similar from one area to another and the types, arrangements, and connections of cortical neurons are highly stereotyped. This supports the idea that each cortical area conducts calculations using similarly structured neuronal modules: what we term canonical computational motifs. In addition, the remarkable self-similarity of the brain observables at the micro-, meso- and macro-scale further suggests that these motifs are repeated at increasing spatial and temporal scales supporting brain activity from primary motor and sensory processing to higher-level behaviour and cognition. Here, we briefly review the biological bases of canonical brain circuits and the role of inhibitory interneurons in these computational elements. We then elucidate how canonical computational motifs can be repeated across spatial and temporal scales to build a multiplexing information system able to encode and transmit information of increasing complexity. We point to the similarities between the patterns of activation observed in primary sensory cortices by use of electrophysiology and those observed in large scale networks measured with fMRI. We then employ the canonical model of brain function to unify seemingly disparate evidence on the pathophysiology of schizophrenia in a single explanatory framework. We hypothesise that such a framework may also be extended to cover multiple brain disorders which are grounded in dysfunction of GABA interneurons and/or these computational motifs.}

The scholars examine the impact of innovative technology solutions used in dance pedagogical practice on the development of dance skills in students. The study also discusses the functionality of interactive and multimedia dance teaching systems, including AI-powered virtual mentoring and cognitive simulations of human mind operations.

This research also focuses on mobile applications used for teaching modern dance. The proposed framework for dance education is based on digital technologies, which help to develop dance skills and improve teaching practices. The scholars conclude that the development and improvement of dance skills are possible only if a teacher combines virtual and real environments in everyday practices. The findings can be used by dance teachers, professional dancers, software developers, and researchers who examine the innovative practices and the application of artificial intelligence in dance education. The ecosystem model reframes thinking about approaches to dance education and can serve as the basis for further development of dance courses and dance style teaching modes.}

abstract = {Cadherins are a superfamily of cell surface glycoproteins whose ectodomains contain multiple repeats of β-sandwich extracellular cadherin (EC) domains that adopt a similar fold to immunoglobulin domains. The best characterized cadherins are the vertebrate ‘classical’ cadherins, which mediate adhesion via trans homodimerization between their membrane-distal EC1 domains that extend from apposed cells, and assemble intercellular adherens junctions through cis clustering. To form mature trans adhesive dimers, cadherin domains from apposed cells dimerize in a ‘strand-swapped’ conformation. This occurs in a two-step binding process involving a fast-binding intermediate called the ‘X-dimer’. Trans dimers are less flexible than cadherin monomers, a factor that drives junction assembly following cell–cell contact by reducing the entropic cost associated with the formation of lateral cis oligomers. Cadherins outside the classical subfamily appear to have evolved distinct adhesive mechanisms that are only now beginning to be understood.}

Second, this paper provides an initial investigation of students’ understandings of line integral expressions, and connects these understanding to the theoretical ways of thinking drawn from the literature. One key finding from the empirical part is that several students appeared to understand individual pieces of the integral expression based on one way of thinking, such as adding up pieces or anti-derivatives, while trying to understand the overall integral expression through a different way of thinking, such as area under a curve.}

Decision support tools and methods, such as Multicriteria Decision Aid (MCDA), are necessary for energy policy, in the pursuit of appropriate approaches necessary to support the restructuring of the energy sector, concerning patterns of energy extraction, generation, transformation and use, from unsustainable to sustainable forms of development. Papers devoted to the investigation of MCDA models using linguistic variables for energy policy support seem to be not available in the international literature. The scope of this paper is to explore different linguistic representation and computational models in MCDA that are or can be applied to energy policy support and to establish a clear linkage between them. This paper argues that MCDA methodologies with direct computation on linguistic variables can support energy policy frameworks, bridging the gap between energy policy makers thinking, reasoning, representation and computing. Finally, current trends, open questions and prospects in this topic are pointed out.}

abstract = {The presence of multiple criteria for evaluating wastewater reuse applications indicates the potential usage of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods for this purpose. However, there is currently a scarcity of studies in the domain literature that utilize MCDM approaches in this application topic. This paper therefore advances the domain literature in two distinctive ways. Firstly, it analyzes and advances the reuse agenda of wastewater from thermal power plants, recognized as large-scale users of water, thus promoting greater water circularity. Secondly, it provides a methodological advance by integrating the notion of Three-Way Decision (3WD) into the computational structure of MCDM methods by introducing a middle reference point. Such an initiative results in a novel 3WD extension of the Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to COmpromise Solution (MARCOS) method. Additionally, this work provides a proof that the MARCOS method utilizes a compromise solution in identifying priority alternatives, along with the integration of a Weighted Aggregated Sum Product ASsessment (WASPAS) metric. An initial hypothetical example illustrates how the proposed approach augments the canonical MARCOS method, particularly in promoting the “thinking in threes” as a more natural information processing approach and the high degree of distinguishability of priorities between decision alternatives. An actual case study in a thermal power plant then demonstrates the contributions of this work. With the best-worst method used to determine the priorities of the decision attributes, the findings reveal that wastewater reuse applications achieving reduced costs for needed infrastructures, operational simplicity, technological compatibility, consumer safety and household savings are preferred by stakeholders. The 3WD-MARCOS approach identifies industrial and commercial use, municipal use, environmental restoration, and household use as the high-priority alternatives, with cooking and drinking as least preferred. These insights guide stakeholders in their design of initiatives that allocate resources for greater wastewater reuse. A comparative analysis yields high consistency of these findings with similar MCDM methods. In addition, the efficacy of the novel 3WD-MARCOS method highlights its potential in handling MCDM problems, including those promoting water circularity.}

From that description, the Sophotechnic Mediation Scale is proposed as a means to assess the extent of an individual's internalization of the new form of thinking. A preliminary empirical investigation with 132 higher education professors and students found the instrument to be statistically consistent, yielding a unidimensional and Gaussian score that behaves as a developmental trait emerging from the interaction with generative AIs, mediated by age and mastery of previous digital technologies and their cultural elements. It is concluded that the results are suggestive of the validity of the new scale and warrant further research.}

Terror Management Theory, in parallel, postulates that mortality salience mobilizes these resources to suppress thoughts of death out of focal attention. Consequently, we predicted that individuals under mortality salience would be less likely to give utilitarian responses to moral conflicts. Two experiments corroborated this hypothesis. Experiment 1 showed that utilitarian responses to non-lethal harm conflicts were less frequent when participants were reminded of their mortality. Experiment 2 showed that the detrimental effect of mortality salience on utilitarian conflict judgments was comparable to that of an extreme concurrent cognitive load. These findings raise the question of whether private judgment and public debate about controversial moral issues might be shaped by mortality salience effects, since these issues (e.g., assisted suicide) often involve matters of life and death.}

From this perspective, data and analytics hold great promise and are necessary—but not sufficient—for improving strategic decision-making. Something more is needed to realize this potential. We specify how to fill this gap using an integration framework between technology and decision-makers, which is especially appropriate in complex and/or volatile environments. Our solution—which comprises a methodology as well as a software architecture—therefore unifies not only human decision makers to technology but each other and also integrates several disciplines that have been hitherto unnecessarily separated. Thereby, it could help organizations to address increasing challenges better as well as improve the exploration of possible futures.}

In such cases, there is typically a simplification in choosing the parameters of the analysis, in the sense that no embedding in multidimensional space is usually assumed and that recurrence is restricted to exact matching (equivalence) of the numerically coded categories. However, such a simplified parameterization brings about some notable changes in the appearance of the obtained Recurrence Plots, which has consequences for the extraction of the standard dynamical measures. Specifically, a categorical Recurrence Plot is often composed of rectangular structures rather than line structures (diagonal and horizontal/vertical), over which the recurrence quantification measures were originally proposed. Starting from this observation, I consider alternative computational procedures to extract a non-biased measure of entropy for the categorical case, showing the viability of such a choice with simulated data}

To describe the use of the combination of a conical custom-made TREO® (TREO CM) stent graft in the treatment of a saccular abdominal aortic endograft (AAA) with long but tight and calcified distal neck.
Materials and Methods
A 65-year-female patient was treated for a saccular 5.2 cm AAA with a 3-cm long but calcified and tight (16 mm) distal neck, precluding the safe use of a bifurcated endograft. Because the patient refused an open surgery, a conical TREO CM endograft was manufactured with 20% proximal oversizing, whereas the 3-cm caudal sealing segment demonstrated a conical configuration comprising a 2-cm and 1-cm nitinol-supported zones of 20% and 10% oversizing, respectively, to avoid excessive strain and incomplete expand at the most distal calcified area, leading ultimately to an insidious infolding and consequent type Ib endoleak. A 24 × 40 mm Treovance aortic cuff was centrally deployed resulting in a 30 mm overlap with the main endograft.
Results
After 6 months, there was complete sealing, and the AAA sac has been shrunk to 45 mm.
Conclusions
The use of a conical TREO CM endograft with a proximal cuff provides a firm fixation centrally and a sufficient distal sealing design in AAAs with calcified and tight distal aorta, constituting a reliable alternative to bifurcated endografts or aortouniliac configurations followed by crossover adjuncts.}

abstract = {Many social systems have a set of opposite interactions such as friend/enemy, cooperation/competition and support/opposition. In these signed systems, there exist functional imbalances from the system-level view because of the existence of unbalanced interactions. However, it is difficult to compute the unbalance degree and transform unbalanced factors to balanced ones in real signed systems. Earlier studies tackled these two issues separately and gave a unique solution, and thus cannot be well applied to real applications with constraints. In this paper, we devise a decomposition-based and network-specific multi-objective optimization algorithm to solve the balance computation and transformation of signed networks simultaneously. The devised algorithm aims at finding a set of optimal balance transformation solutions, and each of which is the trade-off between the twin objectives (i.e., the minimization of inter-cluster positive links and the minimization of intra-cluster negative links). Of these solutions, the one with the fewest unbalanced links corresponds to the solution to the balance computation. And each trade-off solution corresponds to an optimal balance transformation way under a certain transformation cost. Extensive experiments on four social networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the devised algorithm on both the computation and the transformation of structural balance. They also show that the devised algorithm can provide multiple optimal solutions at the same transformation cost.}

Commonly used models include SNP BLUP with extensions (BayesA, etc), genomic BLUP (GBLUP) and single-step GBLUP (ssGBLUP). These models are applied for genomewide association studies (GWAS), genomic prediction and parameter estimation. Solving methods include finite Cholesky decomposition possibly with a sparse implementation, and iterative Gauss–Seidel (GS) or preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG), the last two methods possibly with iteration on data. Details are provided that can drastically decrease some computations. For SNP BLUP especially with sampling and large number of SNP, the only choice is GS with iteration on data and adjustment of residuals. If only solutions are required, PCG by iteration on data is a clear choice. A genomic relationship matrix (GRM) has limited dimensionality due to small effective population size, resulting in infinite number of generalized inverses of GRM for large genotyped populations. A specific inverse called APY requires only a small fraction of GRM, is sparse and can be computed and stored at a low cost for millions of animals. With APY inverse and PCG iteration, GBLUP and ssGBLUP can be applied to any population. Both tools can be applied to GWAS. When the system of equations is sparse but contains dense blocks, a recently developed package for sparse Cholesky decomposition and sparse inversion called YAMS has greatly improved performance over packages where such blocks were treated as sparse. With YAMS, GREML and possibly single-step GREML can be applied to populations with >50 000 genotyped animals. From a computational perspective, genomic selection is becoming a mature methodology.}

Four text-based writing tasks with drafts of associated student work were collected from teachers across a school year. Results of qualitative analyses showed that about half of the classroom text-based writing tasks considered by teachers to be challenging guided students to express analytic thinking about what they read (n = 73). A minority of student work received written feedback focused on students’ use of evidence, expression of thinking, and text comprehension; or received feedback that provided guidance for strategies students could take to meet genre goals. Most teachers provided content-related, instructive, and/or localized feedback on at least one piece of student work. Only a small number of teachers, however, consistently provided content-related, instructive or localized feedback on their students’ essays. Overall, results suggest that students have few opportunities to practice analytic text-based writing and receive feedback that would be expected to advance their conceptual understanding and adaptive expertise for writing in this genre.}

abstract = {The epitaxial growth of PtSe2 monolayer has brings new opportunities for the application and development of materials science. Using first-principles calculations, the effect of vacancy defects, and strain engineering on the electronic properties of PtSe2 monolayer are systematically investigated. The results show that the Pt single vacancy induces a large magnetic moment of 4.0 μB on PtSe2 monolayer and transforms it from semiconductor to metal. However, the Se single vacancy systems are nonmagnetic and realize the PtSe2 from an indirect semiconductor to a direct one. Moreover, the band gap of PtSe2 monolayer can be prominently modulated within a appreciable uniaxial strain range, and the band gap are monotonically increase/decrease as decrease/increase the magnitude of the compressive/tensile strain. In particular, when a specific strain applied, a wide and high absorption peak across near-infrared, visible light and ultraviolet region. These findings not only enrich the fundamental understanding of PtSe2 monolayer but also provide useful guidance to design PtSe2-based spintronic, optoelectronic and gas sensing applications.}

abstract = {The intersection of mathematical cognition, metacognition, and advanced technologies presents a frontier with profound implications for human learning and artificial intelligence. This paper traces the historical roots of these concepts from the Pythagoreans and Aristotle to modern cognitive science and explores their relevance to contemporary technological applications. We examine how the Pythagoreans' view of mathematics as fundamental to understanding the universe and Aristotle's contributions to logic and categorization have shaped our current understanding of mathematical cognition and metacognition. The paper investigates the role of Boolean logic in computational processes and its relationship to human logical reasoning, as well as the significance of Bayesian inference and fuzzy logic in modelling uncertainty in human cognition and decision-making. We also explore the emerging field of Chemical Artificial Intelligence and its potential applications. We argue for unifying mathematical metacognition with advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence and robotics, while identifying the multifaceted benefits and challenges of such unification. The present paper examines essential research directions for integrating cognitive sciences and advanced technologies, discussing applications in education, healthcare, and business management. We provide suggestions for developing cognitive robots using specific cognitive tasks and explore the ethical implications of these advancements. Our analysis underscores the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to realize the full potential of this integration while mitigating potential risks.}

abstract = {In this chapter, we present what should be the inner structure of a decision algebra whose motivation is to fill a causal break induced by context invalidity to ultimately permit human-machine interactions. It turns out that such a decision structure can be qualified using the context change arrow as a disruptive process or as a phase transition according to the geometrical representation of computational contexts as double S-curves. In particular a computational context is always characterized by a shift between sense making and temporal causality. That is, once a causal break occurs, it has to be filled locally by a decision. A causal break is always continuous and never discrete; in effect, in the discrete case, combinatoric analysis causes unwanted complexity due to a lack of knowledge, whereas we need full knowledge thanks to a very precise semantic of a causal break. Intuitively, rather than separating brutally models and counter-models as a proof can do by setting a strong negation operator, we prefer to use the continuous inference as an implementation of sense making. Sense is that way taken as the rationality of the transition. Full knowledge requires a special structure, a Hopf algebra in which the continuous property we cannot implement is replaced by the computable co-continuous property in the co-algebraic component of the decision Hopf algebra. We hope that thanks to co-continuous structures and to co-dimensional exterior algebras, we’ll be able to find out a representation of the continuous inference able to compute a decision rather than admitting definitely and desperately that “such a mechanism is totally out of bounds” and will never ever concern a machine.}

abstract = {AI technology is reshaping language classrooms, prompting students to adopt flexible roles exhibiting linguistic competence and self-regulated learning (SRL) skills. Considerable studies explore the necessary integrated learning perspectives, emphasizing AI's adaptive role as a mind tool. In AI-mediated language learning, the technology's metacognitive importance enables students to learn with AI as a partner, encouraging independent critical thinking. Within Zimmerman's SRL model, AI as a mind tool is integrated for improving language students' strategic employment in a cyclical process. A systematic review, following PRISMA protocols, examines the intersection of AI and self-regulated language learning (SRLL) over 2000–2022. Findings highlight AI's evolving role, predominantly through algorithms and systems, aiming for micro and macro integration. Interactive AI has not fully engaged in two-way directions, despite a familiar process approach in reviewed studies. In the favored ESL/EFL research context, task-specific AI is utilized to encourage cyclical improvement with learner autonomy enhancement mainly among higher education students at intermediate level or above. Pedagogical values are possible when major SRL phases are fully practiced, even without highly autonomous AI. Future research is directed toward adaptive personalized technology by exploring the dynamic interplay between AI technologies and SRLL as educational practices under Education 4.0 principles.}

abstract = {Aims
The Experimental Medicine Approach offers a unique perspective to determine clinical behavior change by engaging a target underlying the cause of a disorder. The present work engaged a novel target of addiction, Reinforcer Pathology, in two studies to test changes in behavior among individuals with cocaine use disorder.
Methods
In Study 1, n = 44 participants engaged the temporal window with episodic future thinking (EFT), a positive prospection exercise. Changes in temporal view and cocaine valuation were tested using delay discounting and behavioral economic demand, respectively. Additionally, a computational model assessed the relative reliance on the near- and far-sighted systems during EFT. In Study 2, n = 71 engaged the temporal window with a negatively-valenced hurricane scenario to test the opposite effects on window length and cocaine valuation.
Results
Results demonstrated systematic and symmetrical engagement of the behavioral target. Study 1 robustly replicated previous work, wherein EFT lengthened the temporal window and decreased cocaine valuation. Moreover, EFT increased the weighting of the modeled far-sighted system, increasing the relative impact of long-term discounting decisions. Study 2 produced opposite outcomes, shortened temporal window and increased cocaine valuation.
Conclusions
This approximately equal and opposite reaction to the manipulations supports reinforcer pathology theory and implicates the temporal window over which rewards are valued as a target to be pushed and pulled to produce clinically meaningful behavior change. Using the Experimental Medicine Approach as a guide, future work should identify new potential interventions to engage reinforcer pathology and use the clinically relevant outcomes as a litmus test for mechanism.}
