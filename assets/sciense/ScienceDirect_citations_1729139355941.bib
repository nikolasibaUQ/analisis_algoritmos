abstract = {This paper presents a theory of the basic operation of mind, Information Dynamics of Thinking, which is intended for computational implementation and thence empirical testing. It is based on the information theory of Shannon, and treats the mind/brain as an information processing organ that aims to be information-efficient, in that it predicts its world, so as to use information efficiently, and regularly re-represents it, so as to store information efficiently. The theory is presented in context of a background review of various research areas that impinge upon its development. Consequences of the theory and testable hypotheses arising from it are discussed.}

abstract = {Critical thinking is a core element of higher nursing education that needs to be promoted during university study. However, lecturing as a teaching method is still heavily used by nurse educators, and nursing students have few opportunities to develop critical thinking skills. This study evaluated the impact of cooperative learning on critical thinking. A quasi-experimental study was conducted (n = 50). Students in the experimental group were arranged into small cooperative groups and completed the clinical practice together, whereas those in the control group practiced individually. After the intervention, total and subscale scores of critical thinking dispositions were significantly higher in the experimental rather than in the control group. The percentage for experiencing positive inclinations or strong dispositions toward critical thinking was 100% among the experimental group, whereas it was 85% among the control group. It is concluded that the cooperative learning-based clinical practicum is helpful for promoting students' critical thinking dispositions.}

abstract = {EEG alpha synchronization, especially in posterior parietal cortical regions of the right hemisphere, is indicative of high internal processing demands that are typically involved in divergent thinking (DT). During the course of DT, as ideation proceeds, ideas tend to become more creative, being more likely to be drawn from new conceptual categories through the use of the cognitive mechanism of flexibility. The present study investigated whether EEG alpha synchronization can be modulated by flexibility in DT by comparing cortical activation patterns during the switch of category (switching) and the stay in the same category (clustering). Twenty participants were required to generate alternative uses of everyday objects during EEG recording. Differential results were specifically found in the lower alpha band (8–10 Hz): whereas clustering showed synchronization typically lateralized in the right posterior parietal areas, switching induced posterior parietal synchronization over both right and left hemispheres. These findings indicate that the two distinct cognitive mechanisms subsuming flexibility (switching and clustering) are associated with a different hemispheric modulation of lower alpha activity, as switching, in comparison to clustering, is related to higher power in the lower alpha band over the left hemisphere. Switching in comparison to clustering may thus require a larger investment of cognitive resources due to the exploratory process of moving from one semantic conceptual category to another in the course of creative ideation.}

abstract = {Over the past two decades increasing focus has been given to local forms of spatial analysis, both in terms of descriptive statistics and spatial modeling. We term this “thinking locally” Fundamental to thinking locally is that a global approach to spatial analysis may not be suitable and that there may be situations where the conditioned relationships we want to measure vary over space. This paper examines the implications of thinking locally not only for modeling spatial processes but also more broadly in terms of our understanding of behavior in space. We begin with a brief survey of local statistical modeling and what might cause relationships to vary spatially and then describe the operation of one type of local modeling framework – that of (Multiscale) Geographically Weighted Regression – to demonstrate the basic concepts inherent in local models and the type of output that is generated by such models. We then examine the implications of a local approach to statistical analysis focussing on the role of local models compared to spatial regression models, diagnostics for local models, and how a local approach relates to issues of spatial scale which have plagued spatial analysis for decades. Attention is then turned to the implications of a local modeling approach to society, commenting on replicability and how local models can be used to measure previously unmeasurable place-based ‘contextual’ effects. We demonstrate the issues raised throughout the paper with an empirical example of house price determinants.}

This enabled us to define the levels of cognitive evolution, levels of language evolution, and to reveal the recursive mechanism of interaction between language and thinking.}

Therefore, “waste-to-energy” (WtE) techniques appear as a possible approach to convert solid residues into energy, within more energy-efficient processes to emit less or no CO2. Plasma gasification constitutes a proficient and clean alternative with multiple environmental gains, simultaneously reducing or eliminating toxicity and pollution issues while avoiding the landfilling of huge amounts of residues. To evaluate the performance of this WtE treatment, the life cycle thinking (LCT) methodology gathers useful impact assessment tools, providing quantifiable indicators on multiple domains. The lack of works reporting the combined assessment of the environmental, technical, economic and social spheres of WtE has been previously noticed and, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no such review so far for plasma gasification. This work proposes a deep review of literature on the life cycle assessment, life cycle costing and social impact assessment of plasma gasification, to evaluate how LCT tools are applied to the energetic valorization of solid residues by this technique, as a measure of sustainability. This provides insights on the contribution of energy recovery as a circular strategy, diverting waste from open dumps or landfills, while producing renewable energy and/or by-products that will replace the use of virgin materials. Herein, an attempt to complement the knowledge in the sectors of renewable energies and waste management is conducted, to support the fulfillment of circular economy goals and contribute to a more sustainable society and way of living.}

To illustrate and study processing by this new feature, we simulated a well-known task in the psychology of reasoning (the Wason card selection task) with four different cognitive styles (strongly reactive, purely executive, weakly reflective, purely reflective) and were able to reproduce the results and types of errors found in studies of human reasoning abilities. The first three profiles account for the results of 90% of human subjects (all those who provide answers that are not acceptable by logical standards). The strongly reactive profile gave a plausible account of the way humans provide the logically incorrect answer to the task. The purely executive and weakly reflective gave an account of how subjects can provide part of the correct answer. The last profile (purely reflective), a much a much slower process, produces a complete and correct answer by logical standards. While the purely reflective process was the only one able to do this, it is to be noted that the purely executive system was able to provide a correct (but incomplete) answer using less computational resources (time).}

I then address the definition of culture, arguing that culture is a property of causal chains, rather than a thing-in-the-world. I briefly address contemporary debates over the nature of culture—embodied versus embedded—and argue for an ecological approach in which culture-in-action unfolds as embodied schemas recognize (and produce) “handles” in the environment. When schemas are “objectively adapted” to the handles, they generate action that is ecologically rational. To explain ecologically rational culture-in-action, I outline a formal approach to cultural learning based on Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-learning theory. I illustrate my approach throughout with examples drawn from the sociology of science.}

Art education must shift from a teacher-centred to a student-centred approach, and students' passive reception of knowledge must be altered. Students' academic enthusiasm and awareness must be fostered, and their ability to locate knowledge resources must be enhanced. Using pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) in visual art education as a benchmark and this study examines art teachers' PCK proficiency in this area. Social learning theory is applied in the art education curriculum through observational learning based on the Artificial Intelligence-based Creative Thinking Skills Analysis Model (AI-CTSAM). An analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and a grey clustering-based performance analysis model are established to enhance AI's effectiveness in art instruction. Most of the methods to assess clustering performance exist in two types in which one is irrelevant actions requiring labels of foundation truth. Examples are Adjusted Rand, Fowlkes-Mallows, Mutual information scores, Homogeneity, Completeness, and V measurements. Model-based cluster analysis is a new classification approach for investigating population heterogeneity utilizing a limited multivariate mixture. Students can describe, analyze, interpret, and evaluate artwork through the visual art education curriculum.}

Synthesizing recent developments in the fields of personality, political science, and psychopathology, we characterize individual variation in politics as high-dimensional, heterarchical, intrapersonally eclectic, and contextually shaped and activated. Developing a data-driven taxonomic model of political-psychological phenomena will help create a foundational base of knowledge within political psychology that is more rigorous, more replicable, and certainly richer to investigate.}

Yet in practice, basic scientific research often treats “sex” as a single, internally consistent, and often binary variable. This practice occludes important physiological factors and processes, and thus limits the scientific value of our findings. In human-oriented biomedical research, the use of simplistic (and often binary) models of sex ignores the existence of intersex, trans, non-binary, and gender non-conforming people and contributes to a medical paradigm that neglects their needs and interests. More broadly, our collective reliance on these models legitimizes a false paradigm of human biology that undergirds harmful medical practices and anti-trans political movements. Herein, we continue the conversations begun at the SBN 2022 Symposium on Hormones and Trans Health, providing guiding questions to help scientists deconstruct and rethink the use of “sex” across the stages of the scientific method. We offer these as a step toward a scientific paradigm that more accurately recognizes and represents sexed physiologies as multiple, interacting, variable, and unbounded by gendered preconceptions. We hope this paper will serve as a useful resource for scientists who seek a new paradigm for researching and understanding sexed physiologies that improves our science, widens the applicability of our findings, and deters the misuse of our research against marginalized groups.}

The indications of the Digicomp framework and 21st-century skills in Europe have outlined the key competences for lifelong learning needed for all citizens, including teachers and students. In this perspective, Education plays a fundamental role in ensuring that citizens acquire the required skills. The objective in the common European framework is clear: to initiate a transition from the culture of knowledge to the culture of competence. Nowadays, technological advancement allows the researchers to create and combine different frameworks with the perspective of an even more tailored, and engaged education, some examples derived from the implementation of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), in the combination of Gamification and AI, or the development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) to foster and create an even more personalized learning and teaching. Following these premises, in this paper, we want to point out new research reflections and perspectives that could help researchers, teachers, educators (and consequently students) to reflect on the introduction of new technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, robot tutors) and on how these can affect on human behavioral development and on the acquisition of new skills and competences (Specifically: Creativity, Critical Thinking, Problem Solving, and Computational Thinking) for the educational context.

AI and Big Data have emerged as defining characteristics of the fourth industrial revolution (IR). AI has developed tools. Because of the novelty, the investigation of IR, AI, and their environmental effects is still in the early stages of exploration. This study investigates how IR and AI affect human and environmental health and also discusses IR, AI, machine-human ideas, innovation, and AI's environmental benefits, further examines the challenges of these innovations, and recommends additional studies to explain their progress. As a result, the application of AI technology in environmental management, particularly concerning pollution, has become a significant advancement in reshaping our approach to monitoring the environment. Numerous countries are reaping substantial advantages by integrating AI in creating, executing, and assessing measures to address environmental degradation. These innovations can yield societal advantages and contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030; unfortunately, it is important to acknowledge that these benefits may not align well with environmental sustainability objectives, and the increasing number of electronic gadgets presents an additional concern. Conducting future research is crucial to investigate the growing prevalence of electronic devices utilized for AI, its potential ramifications for the future trajectory of climate change, and the approaches being taken to address the issue. Future research should prioritize conducting lifecycle environmental impact analyses, developing sustainable AI hardware, optimizing renewable energy usage, advancing climate modeling techniques, finding effective solutions for managing e-waste, utilizing AI for environmental monitoring and protection, conducting socio-environmental impact studies, developing policies and regulations, creating energy-efficient AI algorithms, and integrating circular economy principles to ensure that AI advancements align with environmental sustainability.}

Researchers have long used ‘social ladder thinking’: assuming progressive stepwise phenotypic evolution and asserting that extant species with simple societies (e.g. some halictid bees) represent the ancestors of species with complex societies, and thus provide insight into general early steps of eusocial evolution. We discuss how this is inconsistent with data and modern evolutionary ‘tree thinking’. Phylogenetic comparative methods with broad sampling provide the best means to make rigorous inferences about ancestral traits and evolutionary transitions that occurred within each lineage, and to determine whether consistent phenotypic and genomic changes occurred across independent lineages.}

This neglect is due, in part, to the limitations of the information processing paradigm that dominated cognitive psychology in its formative years. With the emergence of the embodiment approach to cognition, however, sport has become a dynamic natural laboratory in which to investigate the relationship between thinking and skilled action. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore some insights into the relationship between thinking and action that have emerged from recent research on exceptional performance states (e.g., ‘flow’ and ‘choking’) in athletes. The paper begins by explaining why cognitive psychologists’ traditional indifference to sport has been replaced by a more enthusiastic attitude in recent years. The next section provides some insights into the relationship between thinking and skilled action that have emerged from research on ‘flow’ (or peak performance) and ‘choking’ (or impaired performance) experiences in athletes. The third section of the paper explores some practical issues that arise when athletes seek to exert conscious control over their thoughts in competitive situations. The final part of the paper considers the implications of research on thinking in action in sport for practical attempts to improve thinking skills in domains such as business organizations and schools.}

abstract = {Automated container terminals are complex systems where multiple subsystems are deeply interconnected. To enhance overall efficiency, integrating the scheduling of these subsystems is crucial. While most existing literature emphasizes scheduling methods rooted in processing and setup times, obtaining these times is challenging due to the dynamic nature of terminals. This study proposes optimization solutions for integrated scheduling that bypass the need for specific processing and setup times, using systems thinking to prioritize operations based on their connections with the entire problem. A novel complex network modeling technique transforms the scheduling problem into a network, where operations act as nodes and operational constraints as edges. This transformation facilitates the determination of connections between operations based on network topology. Vital node identification metrics based on such connections are then explored to prioritize operations, leading to the design of complex network-based heuristic rules. Furthermore, the complex network modeling technique enables a network-based simulation framework, offering an efficient way to simulate and monitor real-world processes from a network perspective. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these proposed rules, with insights derived from analyzing container handling equipment utilization, setup, and wait times.}

abstract = {Background
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common and progressive type of brain disorder that affects parts of the brain responsible for memory, speaking, thinking, and many other important functions. Apart from its common risk factors such as aging, environment, and lifestyle elements, the risk of developing AD largely depends on gene variants, which present a promising opportunity for identifying novel diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers.
Objectives
Early studies have revealed numerous SNPs simultaneously associated with AD and other diseases such as Parkinson's disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and more. Therefore, it is important to conduct research on identifying single nucleotide missense mutations in certain genes specifically linked to AD to understand the prognosis and diagnosis of the disease.
Methods
In this research, we utilized multiple sequence-based computational tools and database servers to analyze specific missense single nucleotide polymorphisms and their potential effects on protein structure and stability.
Results
Our in-silico analysis revealed SNPs of 3 genes, specifically, ATP8B4, UBXN11, and TREM2, to be deleterious. The associating mutations were found to be destabilizing the protein structure and function of deleterious genes.
Conclusion
Three genes, including ATP8B4, UBXN11, and TREM2 and their associated SNPs, were found to be deleterious and are potentially linked to AD. Amino acid changes associated with these genes were found to affect their interactions, which are connected to specific biological processes and pathways that may trigger AD.}

Five hundred eighty-two 6th graders were recruited from 12 public elementary schools located across Taiwan. Both ready-made and self-constructed instruments were used in this study. The major findings are shown as follows. The three analogy subscales in the multiple-choice form were all significantly correlated with analytical and creative thinking, with their correlations with analytical thinking stronger than those with creative thinking. In contrast, the analogy subscales in the non-multiple-choice form, the simile sentence completion, had a much stronger correlation with creative thinking than that with analytical thinking. The traditional analogical-verbal items in the multiple-choice form and the analogy test items in the form of simile sentence completion could significantly predict creative thinking independent of analytical thinking and also significantly predict analytical thinking independent of creative thinking. In addition, the simile sentence completion, openness to experience, and analytical thinking could significantly explain the variance of creative thinking. Discussions of the findings, with a special focus on the two types of novel analogy items, were presented in the context of the existing literature.}

Several studies had shown that there are different results in EEG patterns of males and females. Therefore, this study examined the EEG pattern changes of males and females during convergent thinking (CT) and divergent thinking (DT) in comparison to the rest condition.Methods: This study was a fundamental-theoretical research with quasi experimental design. 34 subjects (19 boys and 15 girls) were chosen according to available sampling method by using a screening questionnaire. Each of them assigned in three conditions (rest, CT and DT). In the CT and DT conditions subjects were solved the tasks that were related to these two kinds of thinking but during rest condition they didn’t solve any task. In all three conditions, EEG patterns were recorded from 19 scalp areas. The recorded EEG in theta band, were transformed into quantitative form (QEEG) by using neuroguide software and these quantities analyzed by repeated measure ANOVA method.Results: descriptive results of this study had showed that coherence of EEG patterns in convergent thinking and divergent thinking are higher than rest condition. But there was no significant difference between these two kinds of thinking. Also the results of repeated measure ANOVA had shown that these 3 conditions hadn’t significant differences in coherence patterns in two genders. Conclusion: The results probably are due to neglect the especial function of each hemispheres. Other probability that we can consider for these results is the thinking skills that basically have no biological difference. these results can provide a background for future studies about cognitive functions.}

Equally, randomness is widely used in computer science to escape local maxima and find effective solutions to intractable problems. However, randomness has rarely been used as a formal aid in human decision making or investigated in controlled experimental settings. In this pre-registered study, we tested the effect of extraneous random stimuli using Wikipedia's random page generator on 592 British participants' performance across three online tasks: one ‘convergent’ forecasting task and two ‘divergent’ fluency tasks. We found no improvement associated with the treatment and often significant impairment. A Bayesian meta-analysis of the tasks finds strong support for the null hypothesis. We conclude that stimulating lateral thinking through random stimuli is non-trivial and may require such stimuli to be sufficiently task-related or ‘optimally random’.}

The graph structure is a typical tool used to formulate such correlations, it is incapable of modeling high-order correlations among different objects in systems; thus, the graph structure cannot fully convey the intricate correlations among objects. Confronted with the aforementioned two challenges, hypergraph computation models high-order correlations among data, knowledge, and rules through hyperedges and leverages these high-order correlations to enhance the data. Additionally, hypergraph computation achieves collaborative computation using data and high-order correlations, thereby offering greater modeling flexibility. In particular, we introduce three types of hypergraph computation methods: ① hypergraph structure modeling, ② hypergraph semantic computing, and ③ efficient hypergraph computing. We then specify how to adopt hypergraph computation in practice by focusing on specific tasks such as three-dimensional (3D) object recognition, revealing that hypergraph computation can reduce the data requirement by 80% while achieving comparable performance or improve the performance by 52% given the same data, compared with a traditional data-based method. A comprehensive overview of the applications of hypergraph computation in diverse domains, such as intelligent medicine and computer vision, is also provided. Finally, we introduce an open-source deep learning library, DeepHypergraph (DHG), which can serve as a tool for the practical usage of hypergraph computation.}

abstract = {Promoting computational thinking (CT) skills in programming activities has become a key issue in K-12 education, and the shift from visual to text-based programming is an inevitable trend in programming education. Although research on K-12 text-based programming to promote CT skills has been increasing, a literature review that systematically organizes and analyzes it has not yet emerged. Moreover, there are no uniform conclusions on how to design text-based programming activities to effectively promote students’ acquisition of CT skills. The purpose of this study was mainly to determine the effectiveness of using text-based programming to enhance K-12 students’ CT skills, to explore the effects of various text-based programming instructional design factors on CT skill acquisition, and to discuss the key issues and future development of text programming in the K-12 stage. In this study using the quantitative method of meta-analysis and the qualitative method of systematic literature review, 46 studies of text-based programming on K-12 students’ CT skills were retrieved, of which 19 empirical studies including 37 effects size met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis and were therefore used as a meta-analysis. The results showed that text-based programming improved the CT skills of K-12 students overall (Hedges’ g = 0.71, 95% CI [0.51, 0.90], p < 0.01). No publication bias was detected. In addition, the results of the moderator analysis revealed that: 1) text programming had the greatest impact on computational thinking development in middle school students (g = 0.833, p = <0.05); 2) the duration of text programming instruction had the most significant positive impact on students' CT at 16–20 weeks (g = 1.038, p <0.05); 3) the moderating effect of different assessment tools on CT skills in text programming instruction The difference was statistically significant, and the test assessment method had a highly significant positive moderating effect on CT skills of students in grades K-12 (g = 1.005, p < 0.05); 4) The moderating effect of different student sample sizes on students' computational thinking development was significantly different, and the implementation of text-based programming instruction had the most significant effect on students' CT improvement among students with sample sizes of 41 ∼ 60 (g = 0.921, p < 0.05); 5) There were no significant differences in the effects of different text-based programming languages and learning environments on students' computational thinking.However, there are still barriers to developing instructional practices for text-based programming to foster CT in K-12 students, such as the highly abstract and complex syntax of text-based programming. This study found that the most critical issues that need to be addressed in current text-based programming to foster CT in K-12 students are the lack of student interest in text-based programming and the misconceptions that arise when students move from visual programming to text-based programming. To address these issues, future research could begin with improving teaching methods and increasing student motivation and interest.

Intuitive thinking (coined System 1, see Kahneman, 2011) is fast, automatic, and effortless whereas analytical thinking (coined System 2) is slow, contemplative, and effortful. We extend seminal pupillometry research examining these modes of thinking by using electroencephalography (EEG) to decipher their respective underlying neural mechanisms. We demonstrate that System 1 thinking is characterized by an increase in parietal alpha EEG power reflecting autonomic access to long-term memory and a release of attentional resources whereas System 2 thinking is characterized by an increase in frontal theta EEG power indicative of the engagement of cognitive control and working memory processes. Consider our results in terms of an example - a child may need cognitive control and working memory when contemplating a mathematics problem yet an adult can drive a car with little to no attention by drawing on easily accessed memories. Importantly, the unravelling of intuitive and analytical thinking mechanisms and their neural signatures will provide insight as to how different modes of thinking drive our everyday lives.}

Therefore, researchers are paying increasing attention to computational scientific modeling in which students use the computational power of computers to model and learn about science phenomena. However, computational scientific modeling is challenging since it involves not only scientific concepts but also uses computational representations to model the science concepts. This study hypothesizes that prompting students to self-explain critical subgoals of computational scientific modeling before taking part in the construction of models would help them construct correct computational models. This study recruited 65 10th grade students in a 6-week program. They were randomly assigned to a self-explanation group (n = 29) where students learned with the self-explanation for subgoals of computational scientific modeling, and a demonstration group (n = 36) where the teacher directly demonstrated the modeling process before students took part in the modeling activity. This study collected the students' performance in a paper-based and hands-on modeling test, and also their modeling actions in the hands-on test to understand the impact of the self-explanation scaffolding on their computational scientific modeling. The results showed that the two groups demonstrated similar levels of improvements in the paper-based test, suggesting that both types of scaffolding are helpful for computational scientific modeling learning. However, the self-explanation group demonstrated significantly better modeling quality in the hands-on test. Furthermore, the spotlight analysis found the moderation effect of the modeling actions on the relation between the two treatments and the model quality. The self-explanation group constructed high quality models if they took only a low number of modeling actions. Conversely, frequent modeling actions are necessary for the demonstration group to construct quality scientific models. The results suggest that the self-explanation scaffolding is more effective since students did not simply rely on the trial-and-error strategy, but adopted a strategic approach to constructing scientific models.}

Modeling has been used in many diverse disciplines but has yet to be utilized in preemptive evaluation of major US legislative HCPs. Review of US Health Care Policy History (HCPH) viewed in the context of a Complex Adaptive System(CAS) reveals how, unanticipated historical events, politics, social, and personal leadership have tangentially shaped our US HCPs. Future construction of HCPs with the help of CS, and preemptive computational modeling (CM) techniques, will hopefully yield stronger conclusions in legislative HCP construction and advance our US HCS into one with dynamic resilience.}

abstract = {Predominant psychological theories of number acquisition posit that children acquire natural number concepts as they acquire the successor principle, or the knowledge that every natural number is succeeded by another natural number that is exactly-one more than it. However, exactly how children acquire the successor principle remains largely unexplained. Recently developed ideas within this family of theories posit that an abstract recursive successor function is acquired from the recursive structure of number words; however, the types of recursion underlying the successor function and number words are distinctively different (one is a self-referential function and the other is a self-embedded structure), making it difficult to theorize how one type triggers the acquisition of another. Moreover, our analysis of the literature questions if the knowledge about the successor principle is even empirically measurable. Here, we argue that number acquisition is a process of understanding a generative rule that governs the system of natural numbers and point out that the successor principle is not the only generative rule that governs the natural number system. We propose an alternative hypothesis that generative number concepts emerge from children's realization about how the combinatorial rules of numerals allow arithmetic (specifically additive and multiplicative) representations of quantity. Importantly, under addition and multiplication—which are historically rooted in concatenation and grouping of physical objects—natural numbers are mathematically closed. As a corollary, the system of infinitely generative natural numbers is conceptualized. This new theoretical framework allows the construction of novel empirical questions and testable hypotheses based on the formalized rules of numerical syntax and numeration systems, and therefore opens a new avenue for studying later stages of children's acquisition of number concepts.}

Traditional requirements engineering is criticized for its failure in providing a systemic view, overlooking ethical concerns and marginalized social perspectives. It is argued that educational institutions as a part of society need to ethically develop and manage their academic processes and consider such perspectives for emancipation. This critical qualitative research applies the emancipatory systemic methodology of critical systems thinking (CST) for the requirements elicitation of a complex and dynamic university course-timetables management problem. Firstly, the problem is ethically formulated to mitigate Type III errors. Secondly, multiple viewpoints are sought for boundary judgments using a CST-based ethical inquiry of boundary critique to reveal the normative content of the project design, explore imbalances amongst the socio-technical design components, and unveil the underlying ethical issues. The dynamic stakeholder network captures the system's emergence through stakeholder interconnectedness and boundary liquidity by sweeping-in relevant stakeholders through the continuum of various states of the project. This work enlightens requirements engineering by coupling systemic and socio-technical lenses for the elicitation of ethical requirements and the emancipation of marginalized perspectives in complex and dynamic information systems projects in general and timetabling problems, in particular.}

Software Engineering is dedicated to the systematic and efficient development of software, which necessitates the active participation of all team members and a recognition of their unique skills and abilities, including those with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The inclusion of individuals with ASD presents new perspectives, yet there is a lack of systematic evidence regarding the primary obstacles and potential benefits associated with their inclusion.
Objective:
This paper aims to identify, characterize, and describe barriers, facilitators, and methodological proposals described by the community to include individuals with ASD in the discipline of Software Engineering.
Methods:
We conducted a comprehensive systematic multivocal mapping study to evaluate the existing evidence on the inclusion of individuals with ASD in Software Engineering.
Results:
We obtained 34 primary studies from which we identified the main facilitators of motivation to learn new skills, attention to detail, and the ability to report and visualize patterns. In contrast, the main barriers detected were communication, a lack of neurodivergent computational thinking, and sensory integration. Additionally, we identified and classified four categories of proposals that allowed the inclusion of individuals with ASD: (i) using virtual reality, (ii) creating more inclusive workspaces, (iii) encouraging neurodivergent computational thinking, and (iv) improving social skills.
Conclusions:
This study identifies the principal elements that ought to be taken into consideration when allocating tasks and roles to individuals with ASD in software development.}

abstract = {Introduction
Desire Thinking (DT) is a voluntary cognitive process aimed at orienting to prefigure images, information, and memories about positive target-related experience. It comprises of two components: Imaginal Prefiguration and the Verbal Perseveration. DT has been found to be positively associated with alcohol use, gambling, nicotine use, and problematic Internet use. Despite this, neither qualitative nor quantitative reviews have been undertaken to critically summarize findings about the association between DT and addictive behaviours. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the strength of the association between DT and addictive behaviours.
Method
In accordance to PRISMA criteria, a research was conducted on PubMed and PsycInfo. A manual search of reference lists was also run. Search terms were: “addiction / gambling / alcohol / tobacco / nicotine / drug / cocaine / marijuana / cannabis / opioid / heroin / methadone / internet” AND “Desire Thinking”.
Results
Ten studies were included. Both components of DT were found to be associated with addictive behaviours (alcohol use, nicotine use, gambling, problematic Internet use) in both clinical and community samples. The strength of the association between Verbal Perseveration and addictive behaviours appears to be stronger for alcohol and nicotine use than Internet use. The association between DT and addictive behaviours is not moderated by age.
Conclusion
DT is present across different addictive behaviours. The assessment of DT and tailored interventions aimed to reduce the propensity to engage in DT should be considered in the treatment of addictive behaviours.}

The 12 Little Ducks problem stimulated children to visualize and to draw different ways of making equal groups. Fifteen children (83 %) could identify and create equal groups; eight of these children (44 %) could also quantify the number of groups they formed. These findings show that some young children understand early multiplicative ideas and can visualize equal group situations and communicate about these through their drawings and talk. The study emphasises the value of encouraging mathematical visualization from an early age; using open thought-provoking problems to reveal children’s thinking; and promoting drawing as a form of mathematical communication.}

Cognitive abilities, such as intelligence and executive function task performance are measurable early in development and display considerable growth over the course of development. Thinking dispositions include tendencies or styles toward information processing, and the study of these tendencies in development has also been examined in the temperament and metacognitive literature. Cognitive abilities and thinking dispositions support the processing demands of judgment and decision-making tasks, including resistance to miserly information processing. Specific types of knowledge that support judgment and decision-making performance also emerge early in development, including probabilistic numeracy. Knowledge can also inhibit performance, such as endorsement of superstitious thinking. These foundations are all measurable in developmental samples and have also been shown to be correlated with judgment and decision-making performance in child and youth samples.}

However, one of the present challenges includes a lack of engaging learning content and instruction for translating computational concepts that non-CS instructors can bring into their classrooms. Our research team developed the Grove-Blockly platform, a website that employs block-based programming and physical computing elements with simulations to support CT learning and IoT practices. We designed a 5-day workshop with the National Writing Project for students to engage in STEAM learning through making and creative writing. By examining students’ learning through the processes and outcomes of making, coding, and creative writing, we aim to better understand how learning occurs at the intersections of making, writing, and computing. The findings show students’ positive learning outcomes of CT and physical computing from the workshop. Mainly, students gained a deeper understanding of IoT elements (e.g., sensors, actuators) through the process of making and creative writing. This work provides empirical evidence on how students learn CT and computational practices through making and creative writing. Finally, we discuss how the engagement of STEAM practices supports and empowers students’ learning of CT and physical computing through the creation of e-crafts by students.}

However, very little empirical research has examined the potential confounding factors of fluid intelligence and thinking dispositions on the relationship between executive functions and critical thinking. Study 1, based on a large sample of university students, filled this gap by exploring how three core executive functions (updating, inhibition, and shifting) predicted critical thinking after controlling for fluid intelligence and thinking dispositions. The results showed that updating and inhibition predicted critical thinking over and above fluid intelligence and thinking dispositions. In Study 2, we explored the neural basis of the relationship between executive functions and critical thinking. We found that low-level critical thinkers exhibited higher P3 amplitudes than their high-level counterparts when completing updating and inhibition tasks. These results suggest that critical thinking relies on both updating and inhibition processes indexed by the P3 ERP components.}

The food-energy-water nexus is often proposed to be one such holistic approach. However, to date no consistent definition of the nexus concept exists, while research interest in the nexus rapidly grows. Therefore, in this paper, the nexus is defined as a concept of systems thinking. A nexus systems thinking test is developed that can be used as a new way of categorizing nexus research. To examine the test's viability and suitability, it is applied to a sample data set of nexus-related research papers. By means of a multi- and mixed methods document analysis it is analyzed if the papers conceptualize the nexus approach as a systems thinking concept. The results show that all papers meet the four system criteria. Different emphasis, however, is put on certain aspects. The nexus systems thinking test proved to be a viable systematic method to investigate if and in which way nexus research incorporates a systems thinking perspective. It does not only offer a new way of categorizing nexus related research, but also allows assessing its quality from a comprehensive nexus perspective. The test thus provides valuable and systematic understanding of a rapidly developing, central research field within sustainability science.}

This paper presents an original semi-dynamic modelling framework that simultaneously considers i) ES supply and demand dynamics, ii) negative environmental impacts, externalities, and financial costs derived from NBS, and iii) life cycle NBS impacts beyond the use phase. Compared to other models, it also aims to be valuable for urban planning actions at site level, i.e., for evaluating the net impacts of specific urban NBS projects. To validate the modelling framework, a proof-of-concept model for urban forests is developed and tested for a case study in Madrid (Spain). The modelling framework is split in two interrelated parts: foreground (dynamic modelling) and background (static modelling). In the foreground, the environmental impacts derived from the use phase of an NBS project are quantified considering its spatio-temporal dynamism, by making use of system dynamics. In the background, the environmental impacts derived from the rest of the life cycle phases of the NBS are quantified making use of steady state life cycle impact assessment. The net economic impact of the NBS project, considering both financial values and externalities, is eventually calculated in the background encompassing all the life cycle phases. Results from the case study illustrate how planning, design, and management decisions over the entire life cycle of an urban forest can influence the net environmental and economic performance of this type of NBS. A discussion is provided to inform on how the modelling framework can help moving beyond the state-of-the-art, and how the derived model can be used for sustainability assessments of urban NBS projects.}

This quest for bridging explanations – or “consilience” – across the levels is a shared goal of computational psychiatry and cognitive neuropsychiatry and is, we argue, crucial to explaining delusional beliefs. We outline how early computational models appealed to prediction error disturbances as a basis for understanding the early emergence of delusions and show that, despite empirical support, there have been certain explanatory limitations that make a simple prediction error account partially limited. Embedding the account within the increasingly influential hierarchical predictive processing framework subsequently offered a more powerful and comprehensive account, particularly by encouraging the consideration hierarchically-organized inference and its evolution over time. However, further limitations remain in its explanatory scope, most notably the fact that delusions can emerge rapidly and suddenly in a way that seems revelatory and convincing. This phenomenon is not easily encompassed by the standard predictive processing account which emphasizes an iterative process of optimizing inference. However, more recent development in the form of “Hybrid Predictive Coding” posits a complementary rapid inference mechanism. We discuss how this hybrid approach may be key to a more comprehensive computational understanding of delusions.
Résumé
Nous présentons l’évolution d’un modèle computationnel des délires, en commençant par une réflexion sur la manière dont la psychiatrie computationnelle, dont les racines sont fermement ancrées dans la neuropsychiatrie cognitive, cherche à développer des modèles descriptifs et des mécanismes relevant de différents niveaux d’explication afin d’appréhender la manière dont les facteurs neurobiologiques, cognitifs, subjectifs et socioculturels peuvent tous contribuer à une psychopathologie complexe. Cette quête d’explications établissant des ponts entre niveaux – ou « consilience » – est un objectif commun de la psychiatrie computationnelle et de la neuropsychiatrie cognitive et est, selon nous, cruciale pour expliquer les croyances délirantes. Nous décrivons comment les premiers modèles computationnels ont invoqué des perturbations, des erreurs de prédiction pour comprendre l’émergence précoce des délires et nous montrons que, malgré un soutien empirique, la seule prise en compte des erreurs de prédiction est partiellement limitée. L’intégration de l’explication dans un modèle de traitement prédictif hiérarchique a ensuite apporté un pouvoir explicatif plus complet, notamment en encourageant la prise en compte de l’inférence organisée de manière hiérarchique et de son évolution au fil du temps. Cependant, d’autres limites subsistent dans sa portée explicative, notamment le fait que les délires peuvent émerger rapidement et soudainement d’une manière qui semble révélatrice et convaincante. Ce phénomène n’est pas facilement pris en compte par l’approche standard du traitement prédictif qui met l’accent sur un processus itératif d’optimisation de l’inférence. Cependant, un développement plus récent sous la forme du « codage prédictif hybride » propose un mécanisme d’inférence rapide complémentaire. Nous discutons la façon dont cette approche hybride peut être la clé d’une compréhension computationnelle plus complète des délires.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) computing paradigm and its variants, such as the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) and the Internet of People (IoP), have enabled the interconnection of billions of devices with existing computing systems like the social networking platforms. Such interconnection allows IoT applications to offer large-scale context-aware services. On the other hand, the pervasive integration of the IoT and the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have posed many new challenges on the cyber modeling of physical, social and thinking entities. After mapping all the basic elements that form the physical, social and thinking spaces, these elements will be represented in the cyberspace as cyber entities, which are the most elementary particles of the cyberspace. Cybermatics was proposed as a holistic field for the systematic study of cyber entities in the cyberspace and their functions, properties, and conjugations with entities in conventional spaces. In this paper, we emphasize the temporal parts, life cycle and inter-relations of the cyber entities. The potentials of endurance and perdurance cyber mapping are also discussed. Furthermore, a mapping model that incorporates the cyber entity evolution and temporal parts consistency is proposed and presented using a smart home as a use case scenario.}

abstract = {Summary
In this Personal View, we discuss the history and concept of self-disturbance in relation to the pathophysiology and subjective experience of schizophrenia in terms of three approaches: the perceptual anomalies approach of the early Heidelberg School of Psychiatry, the ipseity model, and the predictive coding framework. Despite the importance of these approaches, there has been a notable absence of efforts to compare them and consider how they might be integrated. This Personal View compares the three approaches and offers suggestions as to how they might work together, which represents a novel position. We view self-disturbances as transformations of self that form the inseparable background against which psychotic symptoms emerge. Integrating computational psychiatric approaches with those used by phenomenologists in the first two listed approaches, we argue that delusions and hallucinations are inferences produced under extraordinary conditions and are both statistically and experientially as real for patients as other mental events. Such inferences still approximate Bayes-optimality, given the personal, neurobiological, and environmental circumstances, and might be the only ones available to minimise prediction error. The added contribution we hope to make focuses on how the dialogue between neuroscience and phenomenology might improve clinical practice. We hope this Personal View will act as a timely primer and bridging point for the different approaches of computational psychiatry and phenomenological psychopathology for interested clinicians.}

However, little research exists to inform practice in makerspaces, particularly with young children, under eight years of age. This study adopted constructivist-referred methodology and examined how thirty-four children from Kindergarten to Grade 2 classrooms (5–8 year olds, three classrooms) designed and printed 3D objects using tablet devices, 3D printers, physical materials and IDEO’s five-stage design thinking model. Primary data comprised video screen recordings from separate episodes of pairs of children working together. Across the 16 h of analysed video, different manifestations of design thinking were observed. A range of makerspaces activities invoked creative, critical thinking, problem solving and decision-making skills, aligning with the IDEO design process. This study opens a powerful new door to rich learning potential for young children engaging in maker activities, and paves the way for teachers of young children to explore innovative approaches such as a design thinking, in their everyday practice.}

abstract = {People tend to judge more recent events, relative to earlier ones, as the cause of some particular outcome. For instance, people are more inclined to judge that the last basket, rather than the first, caused the team to win the basketball game. This recency effect, however, reverses in cases of overdetermination: people judge that earlier events, rather than more recent ones, caused the outcome when the event is individually sufficient but not individually necessary for the outcome. In five experiments (N = 5507), we find evidence for the recency effect and the primacy effect for causal judgment. Traditionally, these effects have been a problem for counterfactual views of causal judgment. However, we argue that an extension of a recent counterfactual model of causal judgment explains both the recency and the primacy effect. In line with the predictions of our extended counterfactual model, we also find that, regardless of causal structure, people tend to imagine the counterfactual alternative to the more recent event rather than to the earlier one. Moreover, manipulating this tendency affects causal judgments in the ways predicted by this extended model: asking participants to imagine the counterfactual alternative to the earlier event weakens the interaction between recency and causal structure, and asking participants to imagine the counterfactual alternative to the more recent event strengthens the interaction between recency and causal structure. We discuss these results in relation to work on counterfactual thinking, causal modeling, and late-preemption.}

This systematic review aimed to determine what is known regarding the factors influencing risk at RLXs, with a focus on understanding the causal relationships across the entire sociotechnical system. A systematic search identified 88 published studies. The studies were categorised according to the type of outcome measured or analysed: (1) rates and severity of crashes; (2) unsafe and non-compliant road user behaviours; and (3) road user risk perception, attitudes and beliefs. Most studies focused on unsafe and/or non-compliant road user behaviour. The factors identified within the studies as influencing risk at RLXs were classified using the Accident Mapping (AcciMap) technique, a systems analysis framework. AcciMap maps the factors that influence behaviour across six system levels ranging from Government to the operating environment. Most of the factors identified within the studies related to physical attributes of the crossing itself, its operation, and the behaviours and attributes of road users. Comparatively fewer systemic factors were identified (i.e. policy and budgeting). Few relationships between factors were identified, indicating that little consideration has been given interactions between factors (i.e. how crossing design influences end-user decision making). A research agenda is proposed based on systems thinking and the use of a ‘many model’ approach to understand and address risk at RLXs.}

We frame Smartphone use as an instantiation of the extended mind—the notion that our cognition goes beyond our brains—and in so doing, characterize a modern form of cognitive miserliness. Specifically, that people typically forego effortful analytic thinking in lieu of fast and easy intuition suggests that individuals may allow their Smartphones to do their thinking for them. Our account predicts that individuals who are relatively less willing and/or able to engage effortful reasoning processes may compensate by relying on the internet through their Smartphones. Across three studies, we find that those who think more intuitively and less analytically when given reasoning problems were more likely to rely on their Smartphones (i.e., extended mind) for information in their everyday lives. There was no such association with the amount of time using the Smartphone for social media and entertainment purposes, nor did boredom proneness qualify any of our results. These findings demonstrate that people may offload thinking to technology, which in turn demands that psychological science understand the meshing of mind and media to adequately characterize human experience and cognition in the modern era.}

Future smart cities will be characterized by their high distribution, openness, heterogeneity, complexity, unpredictable/uncertain/dynamic work environments, and their large-scale nature. These challenging characteristics require a transition from the traditional parts thinking paradigm which studies systems by breaking them down into their separate elements to the emerging systems thinking paradigm which represents a holistic approach focuses on the way that a system's constituent parts interrelate and how systems work over time and within the context of larger systems. In this article, we first study smart cities from systems thinking perspective and then introduce self-regulating agent systems and fog computing as promising technological paradigms for developing future large-scale complex smart cities applications. Preliminary simulation results to test the performance of the proposed framework are provided. The results show that self-regulated agent systems can give high performance if an appropriate self-regulation model is used. A complete architecture for building future complex smart cities based on the systems thinking paradigm and using self-regulating MAS integrated with fog computing for implementation is currently under preparation.}

Comprehensive mitigation measures can reduce the structural failure probability under these hazards but usually lead to a conservative structural design and a significant increase in the project budget. With the recent development of sustainable structural design, the multicriteria decision-making method can assist engineers in incorporating the life-cycle investment and probability of hazards in the design selection. In this paper, a life-cycle thinking-based decision support framework that considers multicriteria trade-offs and sustainable design was proposed for the design of coastal bridges under typhoon-induced wave, current and surge conditions. The simulation of the typhoon-induced wave, current and surge conditions was developed using SWAN + ADCIRC model, joint probability and environmental contours. The multispan simply supported (MSSS) bridge was then used to illustrate the framework. The main findings include that the void slab girder is better than the other girder types in the equal-weighted, risk-averse and pro-economic scenarios for the example bridge, but the change in girder types has a small impact on the economic cost index score. The increase in the girder height can increase the failure probability when deck shifting dominates the superstructure's failure.}

In each trial, children saw a pathfinding puzzle presented to an agent, who claimed to have solved it after either 3s or 20s. In Experiment 1 (n = 135), children used agents' response speed to distinguish between memory, perception, and novel inference. In Experiment 2 (n = 135), children predicted that fast responses would be inaccurate, but were less skeptical of slow agents.

Results indicate that emphasizing the use of professional judgment is not sufficient to decrease auditors' mechanistic mentality. As expected, however, auditors primed to take a systems-thinking perspective are better able to evaluate the complexity of the situation and to more effectively apply professional judgment. These results suggest that the goal of improving professional judgment can be achieved with an underlying change to the way auditors think.}

CoDeT aims to scaffold children's collaboration and design thinking in co-design settings characterised by a high child-to-adult ratio (ca. 1 adult for 15 to 20 children), such as schools, museums and maker spaces. In these settings, children have to work relatively independent from adults who become guides on the side. This can be challenging due to children's limited understanding of the design process and their lack of skills to collaborate productively towards a shared design goal. CoDeT addresses these challenges by integrating principles of Social Interdependence Theory (SIT) and Design Thinking (DT), which together form the theoretical backbone of the approach. CoDeT was first applied in a case study and yielded promising results in terms of children's collaboration and design thinking skills, yet possible improvements were found. The insights of this case study informed the revised version of CoDeT presented at the end of this article, in a what-why-how structure, allowing researchers and practitioners to apply the co-design approach in a wide variety of contexts characterised by high child-to-adult ratios.}

In this course the students were exposed to basic systems concepts with a focus on system dynamics modeling (using Donella Meadows’ Thinking in Systems) of a permaculture-based food production system. They were given a basic problem: How much land area would be needed to collect enough solar energy in food plant photosynthesis per year to feed a community of fifty vegetarians? They were told that the farm would be in the Seattle WA, USA area so they could find the average monthly insolation values. Several additional rate constants and conversion factors were provided so they could build a spreadsheet-based model to generate the number of calories needed. This paper provides anecdotal evidence that systems theory naïve students were able to successfully build a model (in teams) but also were able to apply systems thinking to aspects of their own lives as demonstrated in essays (individuals). Many students reported “seeing the world differently” as a result of the course, particularly seeing how different aspects of the world are connected through various relations. As a result of these successes the course was upgraded to be a little more advanced for upper division students.2Problem-Project-based Learning - PPBL, a pedagogy for active learning.}

abstract = {Innovations often arise when people bridge seemingly disparate areas of knowledge, such as the arts and sciences. What leads people to make connections that others might miss? We examined the role of implicit theories of interest—the belief that interests are relatively fixed (a fixed theory of interest) or developed (a growth theory of interest) among people with established interests either in the area of arts or sciences. A stronger growth theory predicted that participants spontaneously noticed more stimuli from the area outside their interests (Studies 2 and 3) and generated better integrative ideas (Study 1). Furthermore, they were more likely to generate ideas that bridged the arts and sciences (Study 2), which was also found after inducing fixed or growth theories, establishing causality (Study 3). Finally,perceived utility of the outside area mediated this relation (Study 4). These results suggest that a growth theory may be important for integrative thinking and innovation across traditional disciplinary boundaries.}

A brief history foreshadows aspects of a proposed taxonomy of attention that builds upon Posner's tripartite taxonomy. Posner's influential taxonomy views attention as a set of isolable neural systems (alerting, orienting and executive control), often working together to organize behaviour. For measuring the efficacy of these three networks, Posner and colleagues created the Attention Network Test (ANT). The impact of the taxonomy and this model task for exploring it is illustrated by the facts that they have spawned numerous variants designed for different purposes and that one or another variant has been used in almost a thousand publications. We have previously built upon this conceptual framework by considering: two modes of control over resource allocation which we labelled exogenous and endogenous and three domains over which these modes of control are presumed to operate (space, time and task or activity). The Combined Attention Systems Test (or CAST) was developed to measure the efficacy of the six kinds of attention implied by revised taxonomy. Lastly, this taxonomic effort is further developed by incorporating the distinction between overt, observable behaviour in the “real” world and covert “behaviour” in the realm of thought and imagination.}

abstract = {Objective
The objective of this study is to apply machine learning algorithms for real-time and personalized waiting time prediction in emergency departments. We also aim to introduce the concept of systems thinking to enhance the performance of the prediction models.
Methods
Four popular algorithms were applied: (i) stepwise multiple linear regression; (ii) artificial neural networks; (iii) support vector machines; and (iv) gradient boosting machines. A linear regression model served as a baseline model for comparison. We conducted computational experiments based on a dataset collected from an emergency department in Hong Kong. Model diagnostics were performed, and the results were cross-validated.
Results
All the four machine learning algorithms with the use of systems knowledge outperformed the baseline model. The stepwise multiple linear regression reduced the mean-square error by almost 15%. The other three algorithms had similar performances, reducing the mean-square error by approximately 20%. Reductions of 17 – 22% in mean-square error due to the utilization of systems knowledge were observed.
Discussion
The multi-dimensional stochasticity arising from the ED environment imposes a great challenge on waiting time prediction. The introduction of the concept of systems thinking led to significant enhancements of the models, suggesting that interdisciplinary efforts could potentially improve prediction performance.
Conclusion
Machine learning algorithms with the utilization of the systems knowledge could significantly improve the performance of waiting time prediction. Waiting time prediction for less urgent patients is more challenging.}

Environmental policy resistance has been identified as stemming from such complexities, yet we lack an understanding of how social and physical factors interrelate to inform policy design. The identification of synergies and trade-offs among various management strategies is necessary to generate optimal results from limited institutional resources. Participatory modeling has been used within the environmental community to aid decision-making by bringing together diverse stakeholders and defining their shared understanding of complex systems, which are commonly depicted by causal feedbacks. While such approaches have increased awareness of system complexity, causal diagrams often result in numerous feedback loops that are difficult to disentangle without further, data-intensive modeling. When investigating the complexities of human decision-making, we often lack robust empirical datasets to quantify human behavior and environmental feedbacks. Fuzzy logic may be used to convert qualitative relationships into semi-quantitative representations for numerical simulation. However, sole reliance upon computer-simulated outputs may obscure our understanding of the underlying system dynamics. Therefore, the aim of this study is to present and demonstrate a mixed-methods approach for better understanding: 1) how the system will respond to unique management strategies, in terms of policy synergies and conflicts, and 2) why the system behaves as such, according to causal feedbacks embedded within the system dynamics. This framework is demonstrated through a case study of nature-based solutions and policymaking in Houston, Texas, USA.}

The learner constructs structured representations of concepts and their relationships to other concepts and fills these structures with the content of the specific design domain or design task. This resulting structured representation of knowledge can later be accessed and expanded in additional processes of design thinking. Web-Pad — a computational tool that implements these ideas is presented and illustrated. Web-Pad is used for organizing and representing conceptual maps of a specific domain.

The goals alone are not enough; appropriate curriculum materials should be used in the classroom if students are to acquire CT skills. This paper describes the development of a framework to analyze CT in primary school mathematics curriculum materials. It then applies the framework to primary school math textbooks in the context of the Israeli curriculum. The framework includes nine categories under three overarching themes: lateral thinking, divergent thinking and convergent-integrative thinking. Although the CT themes are covered, the textbooks provide much more opportunity to engage with CT in mathematics in grade one than in any other grade, but the curriculum sets the same CT objectives for all students. Further, the textbooks have emphases that do not necessarily correspond with the emphasis in the official curriculum. The proposed framework permits the assessment of curriculum materials, an important mediating factor between curriculum and instruction. It can show which activities and materials promote the development of students’ CT and which do not.}

Both studies showed that CT indicated by skills and dispositions made unique contributions to academic performance even when general cognitive ability was controlled for.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to explore the associations among inter-individual verbal creative thinking and both regional homogeneity and cortical morphology of the brain surface. We related the local functional homogeneity of spontaneous brain activity to verbal creative thinking and its dimensions—fluency, originality, and flexibility—by examining these inter-individual differences in a large sample of 268 healthy college students. Results revealed that people with high verbal creative ability and high scores for the three dimensions of creativity exhibited lower regional functional homogeneity in the right precuneus. Both cortical volume and thickness of the right precuneus were positively associated with individual verbal creativity and its dimensions. Moreover, originality was negatively correlated with functional homogeneity in the left superior frontal gyrus and positively correlated with functional homogeneity in the right occipito-temporal gyrus. In contrast, flexibility was positively correlated with functional homogeneity in the left superior and middle occipital gyrus. These findings provide additional evidence of a link between verbal creative thinking and brain structure in the right precuneus—a region involved in internally-focused attention and effective semantic retrieval—and further suggest that local functional homogeneity of verbal creative thinking has neurobiological relevance that is likely based on anatomical substrates.}

Importantly, the issue of stimulus equivalence in developmental samples is much less of a problem in studies that use multiple indicators of cognitive sophistication, not just age differences. These multiple indicators can be used as converging evidence in triangulating developmental trends on rational thinking tasks. Age differences were obtained in childhood and early adolescence in the longitudinal developmental study, but not later in adolescence on all performance-based measures, including cognitive abilities and rational thinking tasks. Resistance to miserly information processing tasks can be used as an additional indicator of cognitive sophistication to correlate with response patterns on rational thinking tasks in developmental samples. Although such tasks do measure other aspects of process and knowledge (cognitive ability and numeracy), they also tap in part the participant’s ability to detect conflicts between normatively correct responses and rapidly emitted Type 1 processing. Task factors, particularly the process and knowledge demands of each rational thinking task, also contribute to explaining developmental patterns on these tasks. Identifying sources of cognitive failures on rational thinking tasks in children and youth can be mapped onto real-world correlates and provide new directions for training of these skills and abilities.}

Inquiring about social issues is currently a common instructional strategy to enhancing generic critical thinking. It has been found effective in nurturing a mind that is structured and evidence-based (e.g., Angeli & Valanides, 2009; Ku, Ho, Hau, & Lau, 2014). Critical thinking, nonetheless, is “not mechanical” (Wegerif, 2007, p. 7). One current challenge is to integrate into the conventional logic-based practice of generic critical thinking instruction the ‘soft’ elements of thinking (Claxton, 1999). We argue that artwork presents itself as distinct and novel alternative to the more verbal-based learning materials that students are habituated. In observing and thinking about art images, pre-logical and preverbal thoughts and feelings that are otherwise not easily assessed can be elicited (Root-Bernstein & Root-Bernstein, 2003). Observing and imaging are primary thinking tools representing the more primitive, implicit, and sensual aspects of a person’s reasoning. In this article, we reviewed evidence of existing generic critical thinking instruction, and illustrated a strategy that infuses visual artwork as the problem context into Halpern’s (2003) Four-part Critical Thinking Instructional Model. There is a need for educators to acknowledge that any high quality thoughts must be a result of the mind simultaneously engaging in creation and critical evaluation of its creations (Paul & Elder, 2008). Though we are cautious not to make an automatic connection between reasoning about artwork and nurturing creative thinking, we considered our argument a step towards recognizing creative and critical thought as “integrated, and unitary” (Paul & Elder, 2006, p. 34).}

The chapter begins with considering the emerging high-level consensus descriptions of the future system model with its structural pillars (data, well-being, and integration) and features (AI, ambient, and collaborative). It then “fleshes” out the details of this form through the system's function, expressed as resilient integration driving health ecosystem operations: Data+well-being=Efficiency+equity. The chapter then seeks to demonstrate how the major structural elements of the future's health ecosystem (precision medicine, public health, telehealth, and safety) and their societal contextual elements (political economics and ethics) can be optimally arranged as “complementary ecosystem base pairs” in the system DNA above, with their double-helix “backbone” being the reality of each patient as a person in community with other persons, understood from a consensus-based pluralistic standpoint. It then seeks to illustrate this final conceptual framework in practical emerging cases including AI-powered well-being (in its global, strategic, and structural aspects), maturing enterprise-wide AI-powered healthcare (in its local, operational, and functional aspects), and emerging transformation trends (including dignity-security moral interoperability, strategic empathy, adaptive empowerment networks, embedded clinical trials, digital twins, quantum health, and liquid AI in cloud electronic health records). The chapter concludes by proposing how modern value-based healthcare systems can transform through efficient and ethical AI to become the future's thinking healthcare system operating as optimized health ecosystems in the global digital ecosystem that is self-aware, self-adaptive, and other-serving, with artificial intelligence integrated with human compassion, worthy of the patients it serves.}

abstract = {With the development of artificial intelligence, statistical learning methods are widely used. Among all artificial intelligence problems, obtaining excellent training models through massive data mining and huge computing power is currently a hot topic. Although such statistical learning methods have shown great potential in academic and industrial applications, the causal logic of machine learning still has poor interpretability. In the factor space theory proposed in 1982, Professor Peizhuang Wang first proposed causal reasoning to find the relationship between causation and effect and created factor space to illustrate causal relationships. Factors play a vital role in the factor space, which can be applied in various scenarios. The projection method provides a way of thinking and perspective for finding factors by projecting the vectors in the n-dimensional real vector space Rn into subspace, and this method has great value in knowledge representation and causal reasoning.}

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of robotics and coding instruction on preschoolers’ problem-solving skills and creative thinking abilities. Designed as a quasi-experimental research with pretest–posttest control groups, this study was conducted in a preschool in Amasya province of Turkey. A total of 40 preschool students were recruited in this study. The data were collected through ‘the Problem-Solving Skill Scale (PSSS)’ and ‘the Creative Thinking Abilities Test’. The experimental procedure lasted for four weeks, and a total of 32 -h lesson was conducted. During the procedure in the experimental group, WeDo 2.0 Educational Robotics Kit was employed, while pen and paper activities were conducted in the control group. The participants in the experimental group performed ‘GlowingSnail’, ‘Moovingsatellite’, ‘Spacecraft’, ‘Milo Science’, ‘Milo’s Motion Sensory Robot’, and ‘Frog Robot’ activities, whereas those in the control group read such stories as ‘Winnie the Witch under the Sea’, ‘Where Do Emotions and Broken Hearts Go’, ‘the Aliens Activity’, and ‘Timing, and listened to ‘the Planets’ song. The results show that robotics and coding instruction has provided statistically significant contribution to preschoolers’ problem-solving skills compared to the pen and paper activities. Further, imagination and originality factors in the language domain as well as completion, new elements addition, and unconventionality factors in the drawing domain were found to be statistically significant compared to the other factors. Several limitations and recommendations are provided.}

Comparing Beethoven's Ninth Symphony to the algorithmic Tenth reveals differences between human and computational creativity. In its speed and fecundity, the AI model captures some of the features of spontaneous human creativity. However, it is less equipped for deliberate creativity, which requires non-linear thinking, context-driven decision-making, elaborating unusual choices, and the capacity to revise. Implications for cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and education are discussed.}

CAL was designed using principles of three theoretical frameworks: Curriculum Research Framework (CRF), which proposes different phases in the creation of research-based curriculum; Constructionism, which presents a computationally-rich project-based methodology based on identifying powerful ideas from a learning domain; and Positive Technological Development, which intentionally integrates socio-emotional and ethical dimensions into curricular experiences. The pedagogical foundation of CAL involves the understanding of coding as a literacy, that is, putting developmentally-appropriate powerful ideas of computer science in conversation with those taught in language arts. The paper first describes CAL and then presents results from both a pilot study and a cluster randomized controlled trial that set to evaluate CAL's feasibility and impact on students’ learning outcomes. Our findings showed that the CAL curriculum was not only feasible to implement, but also effective for improving coding skills. However, CAL's impact on computational thinking is less clear given that in the cluster randomized controlled trial, both the control and the intervention groups improved equally on a measure of computational thinking.}

The question is how typical it is for each specialization in our educational system that the composition of the subjects specified in the national curricula should influence the development of problem-solving skills and limit the field of human subjects where it is less important to apply cognitive models or algorithmic thinking acquired through the study of formal sciences. The participants in the experiment were taken from the first year students of Sapientia University, Faculty of Technical and Human Sciences of Tirgu Mures (N = 231). Our research confirmed the expected results, that programming experience and good programming skills are associated with in-depth, context-independent algorithmic thinking. An even more important result, however, is that the advanced algorithmic thinking operations presume high level reading comprehension skill: possession of integration and interpretation, as well as reflection and evaluation skills.}

In this article, a novel concept Cybermatics is put forward as a broader vision of the IoT (called hyper IoT) to address science and technology issues in the heterogeneous CPST hyperspace. This article covers a broaden research field and presents a preliminary study focusing on its three main features (i.e., interconnection, intelligence, and greenness). Concretely, interconnected Cybermatics refers to the variants of Internet of anything, such as physical objects, cyber services, social people, and human thinking; intelligent Cybermatics considers the cyber–physical–social–thinking computing to provide algorithmic support for system infrastructures; green Cybermatics addresses energy issues to ensure efficient communications and networking. Finally, open challenging science and technology issues are discussed in the field of Cybermatics.}

We use recent examples to showcase some of the key computational approaches in current use and highlight that the overall philosophy of ‘surface-swapping’ — the replacement of solvent-facing residues with amino acids bearing lipid-soluble hydrophobic sidechains — is a promising avenue in membrane protein design. We conclude by highlighting outstanding design challenges and the emerging role of AI in sequence design and structure ideation.}

The sample consisted of 2424 undergraduates from 130 classrooms. Multilevel modeling showed that students' mathematical thinking about the derivative varied primarily as a function of their gender and cumulative grade point average (within-classroom level) and of their faculty affiliation (between-classroom level). Parents' educational attainment and high school mathematics achievement at the within-classroom level, and grade level at the between-classroom level were only moderately associated with different mathematical thinking aspects.

Computational data-centric research techniques play a prevalent and multi-disciplinary role in life science research. In the past, scientists in wet labs generated the data, and computational researchers focused on creating tools for the analysis of those data. Computational researchers are now becoming more independent and taking leadership roles within biomedical projects, leveraging the increased availability of public data. We are now able to generate vast amounts of data, and the challenge has shifted from data generation to data analysis. Here we discuss the pitfalls, challenges, and opportunities facing the field of data-centric research in biology. We discuss the evolving perception of computational data-driven research and its rise as an independent domain in biomedical research while also addressing the significant collaborative opportunities that arise from integrating computational research with experimental and translational biology. Additionally, we discuss the future of data-centric research and its applications across various areas of the biomedical field.}

How to discover and excavate the effective material basis of TCM, clarify and interpret the related action mechanism? How to clarify the reasonableness of compatibility, the scientificity for usage of medication, as well as the scientific connotation of TCM in preventing and curing disease?

According to the practice progress and thinking on research of effective material basis and related mechanism in Naomaitong Granule and Dengzhan Shengmai Capsule, a systematic strategy from the perspective of interaction between drug system, intestinal microecosystem and host living system had been proposed and elucidated in three aspects: (1) Discovering the TCM regulated genes and proteins dated from functional metabolites, in order to characterize the biological response of host systematically. (2) Deciphering the effective material basis and related acting mechanism on the base of interaction between TCM formula and intestinal microecosystem.

In order to obtain the investment alternatives, as well as the evaluation criteria, the Value-Focused Thinking (VFT) was applied. After obtaining all necessary data, the CRITIC-GRA-3N method was used as a Multicriteria Decision Support technique, with the CRiteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) method to generate the criteria weights and the Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) method, with three normalizations, to order the alternatives. With this, five ordinations were established, being the first three ordinations performed with the help of two normalizations and the last two ordinations being the arithmetic and geometric averages of the first three ordinations normalized with the third normalization. In the end it brought positive results to the microenterprise.}

Answers to this question often frame information processing as a competition between cognition and motivation. Here, we dissolve this dichotomy by bringing together two theoretical frameworks: epistemic motivation and active inference. Despite evolving from different intellectual traditions, both frameworks attest to the indispensability of motivational considerations to the epistemic process. The imperatives that guide model construction under the epistemic motivation framework can be mapped onto key constructs in active inference. Drawing these connections offers a way of articulating social psychological constructs in terms of Bayesian computations and provides a generative testing ground for future work.}
