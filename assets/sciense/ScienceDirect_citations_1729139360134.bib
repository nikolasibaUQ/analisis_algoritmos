abstract = {The article proposes a research agenda for computational empowerment for emerging technologies in the field of child–computer interaction (CCI) – in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), the internet of things (IoT), augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR). This research agenda includes three levels of operation for future studies: (1) participatory practice, capable of engaging teachers and students in co-developing and designing approaches for teaching and learning emerging technologies, (2) educational principles for integrating technological and societal aspects of emerging technologies, and (3) digital tools for engaging students in construction of and critical reflection on emerging technologies. The research agenda was developed from longitudinal studies of the respective emerging technologies in Danish K–12 education, participatory design research with in-service teachers, development of novel tools and technologies, and literature studies of current CCI research. The paper addresses current gaps in the CCI literature and contributes a coherent approach and guiding questions for future CCI research on computational empowerment for emerging technology in education.}

abstract = {Currently, flipped learning requires a framework that will give novices and students the ability to face the complex problems encountered in programming courses. It is necessary to design a design thinking learning framework that addresses independent learning and specific processes that will improve students' 21st-century skills. The existing literature has not implemented flipped programming courses from a design thinking perspective (Cook & Bush, 2018), which would thus be an innovative approach to designing teaching methods and investigating the effects of this framework. The purpose of this study was to develop analyze, observe, reflect, conceive, design, implement, and operate (Crawley et al., 2007) a DT-CDIO model and to investigate the relationship of the flow experience to computational thinking and cognitive load in order to understand the impact of the flow experience on a flipped programming course. The participants in this study comprised 40 pre-service education students (Male = 17; Female = 23). The partial least squares (PLS) method was used for the data analysis to test the model. This study was intended to obtain and evaluate significant differences between the students' flow experience and their computational thinking ability and cognitive load. The results indicated that the DT-CDIO pedagogy filled a long-standing gap related to a lack of reflective pedagogy and design thinking problems. The flow experience negatively impacted creativity and problem solving ability. Meanwhile, intrinsic cognitive load negatively impacted the flow experience. Germane cognitive load positively impacted the flow experience. In particular, the flow experience is a crucial factor that can be used to predict various computational thinking skills in a programming curriculum. More importantly, this study provides important insights into the implications of the DT-CDIO approach and other related factors.}

abstract = {This study is a digital form-finding and manual fabrication experiment in woven architectural design, with one traditional weaving style, Kagome, used to scale the craft up into an architectural-scale bamboo woven artifact. Kagome is a trihexagonal pattern employed in traditional bamboo basketry as a triaxial weaving system, resulting in an object with a self-bracing capacity without the use of fasteners owing to its interlacing lattices. Although existing studies and tools have addressed triaxial weaving design and representation, the current consideration of the advantages of weaving with bamboo is insufficient. To address this research gap, this study develops a computational design method based on studies on bamboo basketry. This allows for the representation and exploration of design geometries using combinations of regular triangular meshes for the fabrication of Kagome woven bamboo artifacts. A full-scale mock-up was fabricated to evaluate the effectiveness of the method. The mock-up demonstrated the self-bracing properties of Kagome, but there were discrepancies between the mock-up and the design. Factors affecting bamboo weaving on an architectural scale have been identified within this study to inform future research on woven bamboo structures.}

Previous studies show that profound understanding of human drivers’ capability to interpret and anticipate traffic situations is required in order to provide similar capacities for automated driving technologies. There is currently not enough a priori understanding of these anticipatory capacities for safe driving applicable to any given driving situation. To enable the development of safer, more economical, and more comfortable automated driving experience, expert drivers’ anticipations and related uncertainties were studied on public roads. First, driving instructors’ expertise in anticipating traffic situations was validated with a hazard prediction test. Then, selected driving instructors drove in real traffic while thinking aloud anticipations of unfolding events. The results indicate sources of uncertainty and related adaptive and social behaviors in specific traffic situations and environments. In addition, the applicability of these anticipatory capabilities to current automated driving technology is discussed. The presented method and results can be utilized to enhance automated driving technologies by indicating their potential limitations and may enable improved situation awareness for automated vehicles. Furthermore, the produced data can be utilized for recognizing such upcoming situations, in which the human should take over the vehicle, to enable timely take-over requests.}

Despite its importance, little is known about when and how mental rotation processes are activated in games explicitly targeting spatial reasoning tasks. In particular, the relationship between spatial abilities and TetrisTM has been analysed several times in the literature. However, these analyses have shown contrasting results between the effectiveness of Tetris-based training activities to improve mental rotation skills. In this work, we studied whether, and under what conditions, such ability is used in the TetrisTM game by explicitly modelling mental rotation via an ACT-R based cognitive model controlling a virtual agent. The obtained results show meaningful insights into the activation of mental rotation during game dynamics. The study suggests the necessity to adapt game dynamics in order to force the activation of this process and, therefore, can be of inspiration to design learning activities based on TetrisTM or re-design the game itself to improve its educational effectiveness.}

As the result, the advent of contradiction is postponed by the rewrite. The duality of internal measurement subject prevents inner dialogue in second person from lapsing into monologue.

This study was part of an interdisciplinary research project exploring emerging technologies in education (CEED). We involved 9 teachers and 26 students (14–15 y) in Denmark in teaching about machine learning and augmented reality. In the article we develop a framework for applying computational empowerment in formal educational contexts. Based on the study, we found that computational empowerment builds on distinct layers which are these four principles. Specifically, merging the principles Closeness and Embodied Learning can increase student engagement and motivation in the activities; in addition, Decoding and Design Process are key principles for promoting student awareness of the societal impacts of emerging technologies. Based on qualitative data from this intervention, we discuss the opportunities and challenges for child–computer interaction in moving toward computational empowerment in practice.}

In order to explore this question, the effects of IT in authentic research settings were studied through retrospective interviews with 24 academic researchers. Analysis of the researchers’ descriptions of their learning and thinking processes shows that the effects of IT on higher order thinking strategies can be classified, following Perkins [Perkins, D. N. (1985). The fingertip effect: How information processing technology changes thinking. Educational Researcher, 14(7), 11–17], into first order effects and second order effects. First order effects of IT amplify or improve existing thinking strategies, without changing their nature, while second order effects of IT cause significant changes in the researchers’ thinking strategies. The results demonstrate that both types of effects take place in authentic research settings, often existing side by side. This article explores several examples of the ways in which IT affects higher order thinking strategies (such as forming research questions, constructing models and evaluating information), examines the types of effects created by IT, the conditions required for these effects to take place, and the role of distributed cognition.}

Sixty-five participants (Study 1) completed a verbal fluency task and a divergent thinking task, half of the participants doing so over the Internet. Online administration did not affect originality, but led to slightly fewer responses overall. This demonstrated that online administration of creative thinking is indeed feasible and reliable, though steps must be taken to ensure participants exhaust all possible responses. To test the effect of time limits on responses, 84 participants (Study 2) completed a verbal fluency task and three divergent thinking tasks online, half of the participants doing so under time pressure (3min). There were significant interactions between time limits and task content for both time-on-task and fluency variables, but the task type was the dominant force in the varying fluency and time-on-task scores. Originality was not significantly affected by time limits, but did vary across tasks. In all cases the results illustrate that assessment of divergent thinking, as a proxy of creative thinking, is feasible using online methods. Implications for future work in this area are discussed.}

In TCM theory, pathogenesis is a complex system composed of a group of interrelated factors, which is highly consistent with the character of systems science (SS). In this paper, we introduce a heuristic definition called pathogenesis network (PN) to represent pathogenesis in the form of the directed graph. Accordingly, a computational method of pathogenesis diagnosis, called network differentiation (ND), is proposed by integrating the holism principle in SS. ND consists of three stages. The first stage is to generate all possible diagnoses by Cartesian Product operated on specified prior knowledge corresponding to the input symptoms. The second stage is to screen the validated diagnoses by holism principle. The third stage is to pick out the clinical diagnosis by physician-computer interaction. Some theorems are stated and proved for the further optimization of ND in this paper. We conducted simulation experiments on 100 clinical cases. The experimental results show that our proposed method has an excellent capability to fit the holistic thinking in the process of physician inference.}

Due to inadequate detection, heterogeneity in tumor formation, chemoresistance, drug resistance, and also manifestation of metastases, the death rate is increasing. Hence, managing of these challenges needs more potent and effective anticancer drugs. The new drug development requires longer time and more cost. Therefore, in the recent technological advancement, search for alternate methods to develop new drugs is a necessary step, which can remove the complex processes, lessen cost, shorten time, and improves success rates. Drug repurposing, computational chemistry, and Artificial Intelligence-assisted approaches are new and novel way of thinking toward the development of anticancer drugs. Drug repurposing with AI can develop a novel effective and specific anticancer drug for the treatment of cancer. The application of AI helps to diagnose the actual cause of cancerous development in the patient and also to determine the doses of effective drugs to be applied for particular cancer. AI together with computational chemistry provides an enhancement to the medical system for the effective diagnosis and treatment of cancer.}

Prior research suggests that STBs often function as an attempt to escape aversive affect, and that people with BPD experience stronger emotion reactivity and greater discomfort with emotion than those without BPD. Here, we tested whether negative affective states are more likely to predict suicidal thoughts among those with BPD than those without this disorder. Data on affective states and suicidal thoughts were collected several times per day from 35 psychiatric inpatients using their smartphones to capture real-time associations between negative affect and suicidal thoughts. Results revealed that the association between negative affective states (e.g., abandonment, desperation, guilt, hopelessness, loneliness, rage, self-hatred, and upset), and severity of suicidal thinking was stronger among those with BPD than among those without BPD. This finding has implications for risk assessment and intervention in the clinical setting: for a given degree of reported negative affect, patients with BPD experience more suicidal ideation than those without. Further research needs to be done to elucidate the mechanism of this effect.}

abstract = {It is widely accepted that the traditional predict-then-act approach to long-term planning for delivery of public services, such as energy, water or transportation, cannot withstand uncertainties and complexities associated with issues such as population growth, changing demands and climate change. In this regard, various planning approaches have been put forward by the scholarship as alternatives to the conventional model. The planning practice, however, is often following the path-dependent legacy of conventional approaches. This study puts forward a planning intervention, which can be plugged into conventional planning processes, as a way of building capacity for alternative planning approaches to take off. The intervention aims at enabling exploratory thinking within the planning process. Exploratory thinking considers alternative perspectives to planning issues, different from the well-established frames of reference, to potentially reveal some of the blind-spots in the business-as-usual planning. Trial application of the proposed intervention within the process of planning for development of a flood management strategy in Melbourne, Australia, provides propitious indications of widening the scope of thinking among the participants. Based on the achieved insights, a methodology for carrying out the proposed intervention is presented. The methodology would be relevant, and potentially useful, for both planning scholars and practitioners.}

This gap in AI literacy primary school education presents theoretical and pedagogical challenges. Despite the pervasive influence of AI, which can exacerbate inequalities and raise ethical challenges, primary students often lack an understanding of AI principles and mechanisms. Recent developments in age-appropriate AI learning tools have extended AI literacy to primary schools, but AI literacy frameworks for this age group remain underdeveloped. This study aims to conceptualize AI literacy by analyzing existing theoretical frameworks and proposing a new inclusive AI literacy framework for young students. A scoping review is employed using four credible index databases, and 19 articles are selected, with 17 AI literacy frameworks identified across all educational levels, from early childhood to university. This study reveals that the predominant methodologies for developing AI literacy frameworks involve empirical research studies and literature reviews, adhering to national government or institutional standards. These frameworks commonly incorporate 1) Bloom's taxonomy or a similar progression framework, such as Use-Create-Modify, 2) constructionism, and 3) computer science perspectives such as theories of computation. The findings reveal that AI literacy is situated at the intersection of digital literacy, data literacy, computational thinking, and AI ethics, emphasizing the need for a transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary approach that encompasses both technological and societal impacts. However, the study argues that the current paradigms of AI literacy frameworks for young students often emphasize constructionist perspectives without fully considering the interactions between human and technological agents. This gap highlights the necessity for a new conceptual framework that acknowledges both human and non-human agents in AI literacy education for young students. The research contributes by conceptualizing AI literacy and guiding policymakers and curriculum designers to implement holistic AI literacy education for young students.}

To implement the IoT concept, the research in the areas of power controlled circuits, embedded systems design, network protocols and control theory should be required. With the much advancement in these areas, the realization of IoT is becoming increasingly probable. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive power control scheme for IoT systems. Based on the cognitive hierarchy thinking mechanism, our proposed scheme is designed as a new behavioral game model to adaptively control the power level. To effectively solve the power control problem in IoT systems, game theory is well-suited and an effective tool. The experimental result illustrates that our game-based approach can get an effective transmission power, which can make the communication rate maximal. Under dynamic IoT system environments, it is highly desirable property.}

This is demonstrated through four simulated cases centred on the proposed Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR). This is achieved by two-way coupling the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code OpenFOAM and the Computational Thermodynamics (CT) code Thermochimica, using the Joint Research Centre Molten Salt Database (JRCMSD). Local chemical equilibrium is assumed, implying that chemical kinetics are predominantly governed by mass transport. Four simulations address normal operating conditions, exploring: (i) dilution of fission products injected within the molten salt coolant, (ii) molten salt coolant evaporation rate, (iii) release of radioactive gaseous species, (iv) shifts in the UF4/UF3 ratio, and (v) comparison of vapour pressures of gaseous species. The influence of temperature-dependent viscosity on retaining fission products, compared to consistent values, is also discussed. The feasibility of integrating CFD with Thermochimica showed promising results, broadening insights into multiphysics systems and setting the stage for its application in more intricate scenarios.}

In the study “Reflective Thinking Skills towards Problem Solving Scale” (Kızılkaya & Askar, 2009) and “Mathematics Attitude Scale” (Onal, 2013) have been used. In order to determine the levels of students in terms of reflective thinking skills towards problem solving and their attitudes towards mathematics, the arithmetic mean and standard deviation values of the scores obtained via the scales have been calculated and to find out if there is a significant difference between these scores regarding gender, MANOVA has been used. Whether there is a significant difference between the scores of male and female students has been tested by using the scores the students got in total and in the sub-dimensions of the scales. It is found that there does not exist a significant difference between the students’ reflective thinking skills towards problem solving and their gender. However, there is a significant difference in favor of the male students in terms of their attitudes towards mathematics. There is a moderate significant difference between the students’ reflective thinking skills towards problem solving and their attitudes towards mathematics in the positive sense.}

abstract = {The ability to control unwanted memories is essential for emotional regulation and maintaining mental health. Previous evidence indicates that suppressing retrieval, which recruits executive control mechanisms to prevent unwanted memories entering consciousness, can cause forgetting, termed suppression-induced forgetting (SIF). Since these executive mechanisms involve multiple mental operations, we hypothesize that the efficacy of SIF may be limited by individuals’ capacity limitation of cognitive control. Here, we tested this hypothesis. Participants were assigned to two groups based on the median of their cognitive control capacity (CCC, estimated by the backward masking majority function task) and performed the think/no-think task with electrophysiological signals recorded. The results showed that the SIF effect was observed only in the high CCC group but not in the low CCC group. In accordance, repeated suppression attempts also resulted in a steeper reduction in intrusive thoughts in the high CCC group. Furthermore, ERP analysis revealed a decrease in recollection-related late parietal positivity (LPP) under the no-think condition in the high CCC group. A mediation analysis revealed that the reduced intrusive memories mediated the effect of CCC on SIF. These findings suggest that suppressing retrieval could reduce traces of the unwanted memories, making them less intrusive and harder to recall. More importantly, successful SIF is constrained by the capacity of cognitive control which may be used to ensure the coordination of multiple cognitive processes during suppression.}

The results point to the significance of concrete reasoning for the prevalence of non-educational PED use, while thinking style is not statistically useful in explaining educational use of PEDs. We also find that thinking style interacts with educational PED use in determining academic performance. As a whole, using PEDs can be academically beneficial or harmful for students depending on whether they use PEDs for educational or non-educational purposes.}

In parallel emerged the ability to detach oneself from the immediate environment to process abstract thoughts and solve problems and to understand other individuals’ thoughts and intentions. Rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) is thought to play an important role in supporting the integration of abstract, often self-generated, thoughts. Thoughts can be temporally abstract and relate to long term goals, or past or future events, or relationally abstract and focus on the relationships between representations rather than simple stimulus features. Behavioural studies have provided evidence of a prolonged development of the cognitive functions associated with RLPFC, in particular logical and relational reasoning, but also episodic memory retrieval and prospective memory. Functional and structural neuroimaging studies provide further support for a prolonged development of RLPFC during adolescence, with some evidence of increased specialisation of RLPFC activation for relational integration and aspects of episodic memory retrieval. Topics for future research will be discussed, such as the role of medial RPFC in processing abstract thoughts in the social domain, the possibility of training abstract thinking in the domain of reasoning, and links to education.}

abstract = {A central theme of this chapter and of this book is that individuals are smart and this sense rational and can be expected to make smart choices. But these choices typically do not conform the behavioural norms specified by conventional economics for rational behaviour and, therefore, for rational choices. Smart thinking encompasses behaviour that is based on what the individuals deem to be the best path towards achieving their objectives. This behaviour is heavily affected by their decision-making environment as well as their decision-making capabilities, neither of which need be ideal nor fit for purpose. Smart thinking and smart decision-making therefore overlap with the concepts of bounded rationality and satisficing developed by Simon. But smart thinking or broadly rational behaviour might very well appear to be irrational from the prism of conventional economics because they typically don’t conform to conventional behavioural norms for rationality. I also argue, flowing upon Gigerenzer’s fast and frugal heuristics narrative, that adhering to these conventional behavioural norms can result in sub-optimal outcomes from the point of view of the individual decision-maker. Indeed, adopting different behavioural norms and making different choices often yield better outcomes. Being neoclassically rational can actually yield sub-optimal or inefficient outcomes. Ultimately, optimal decision-making norms is context dependent—one size does not fit all. These norms can involve either slow or fast thinking (Kahneman), dependent on circumstance. Also, in the smart thinking narrative errors and biases in decision-making can still take place, but they are correctable through experience and appropriate changes in decision-making capabilities and the decision-making environment. The latter can also correct for any externalities that are often part and parcel of smart or rational decision-making. This chapter also provides a chapter-by-chapter summary of this book.}

This phenomenon was studied in an experiment where participants made multidimensional visual choices. It was found that the effect of this shift on decision-making performance was dependent on the quality of the explanations during introspection, while the performance in silent conditions was not. Therefore, it appears that the effect of introspection on judgments is not only influenced by the thinking mode per se, but also by the individual’s ability to approach the decision problem analytically.}

Effects also did not vary as a function of the theme of the counterfactual-inducing situation or study design (cross-sectional versus longitudinal). Significant effect size heterogeneity was observed across sample types, methods of assessing upward counterfactual thinking, and types of depression scale. Significant positive effects were found in studies that employed samples of bereaved individuals, older adults, terminally ill patients, or university students, but not adolescent mothers or mixed samples. Both number-based and Likert-based upward counterfactual thinking assessments produced significant positive effects, with the latter generating a larger effect.

In particular, they tend to (i) focus on people's worldviews and political identities, at the expense of their other, more specific prior beliefs, (ii) lack direct comparison with a politically unbiased benchmark, and (iii) focus on people's judgments of new information, rather than on their posterior beliefs following exposure to the information. We report two studies designed to address these limitations. In our design, U.S. subjects received noisy but informative signals about the truth or falsity of partisan political questions, and we measured their prior and posterior beliefs, and cognitive sophistication, operationalized as analytic thinking inferred via performance on the Cognitive Reflection Test. We compared subjects' posterior beliefs to an unbiased Bayesian benchmark. We found little evidence that analytic thinking magnified politically biased deviations from the benchmark. In contrast, we found consistent evidence that greater analytic thinking was associated with posterior beliefs closer to the benchmark. Together, these results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that cognitive sophistication magnifies politically biased processing. We discuss differences between our design and prior work that can inform future tests of this hypothesis.}

ABSTRACT
Biologists consider variability during biological investigations. A robust quantitative understanding of variability is particularly important during data analysis, where statistics are used to quantify variation and draw conclusions about phenomena while accounting for variation. Many students struggle to correctly apply a quantitative understanding of variation to statistically analyze data. We present quantitative and qualitative analyses of introductory biology students’ responses on two pairs of multiple-choice questions querying two concepts related to the quantitative analysis of variation. More students correctly identify a mathematical expression of variation than correctly interpret it. Many students correctly interpret a nonsignificant p-value in the context of a very small sample size, but fewer students do so in the context of a large sample size. These results imply that many students have an incomplete quantitative understanding of variation. These findings suggest that instruction focusing on conceptual understanding, not procedural problem solving, may elevate students’ quantitative understanding of variation.}

We present analysis and results from multiple sessions conducted during a teaching experiment cast as one-on-one intervention. Results of a multi-phase qualitative analysis reveal two themes evident in the child’s thinking structures across the sessions: (a) Gina’s accommodations over time versus traditional progressions, and (b) Persistent factors that interacted with the child’s reasoning. Throughout the analysis, we raise questions about the child’s reasoning and what the child’s apparent knowing and learning was relying upon. When well-intentioned researchers or educators provide children interventions that promote procedures and replication of teacher-taught strategies, not only are they not serving their children’s mathematics learning needs, they may be preventing them from engaging in, reflecting upon, and coordinating actions that support the children to accommodate their thinking structures and advance their learning.

We studied whether individual performance (N=117) in divergent thinking (alternative uses task) and convergent thinking (remote association task) can be predicted by the individual spontaneous eye blink rate (EBR), a clinical marker of dopaminergic functioning. EBR predicted flexibility in divergent thinking and convergent thinking, but in different ways. The relationship with flexibility was independent of intelligence and followed an inverted U-shape function with medium EBR being associated with greatest flexibility. Convergent thinking was positively correlated with intelligence but negatively correlated with EBR, suggesting that higher dopamine levels impair convergent thinking. These findings support the claim that creativity and dopamine are related, but they also call for more conceptual differentiation with respect to the processes involved in creative performance.}

Its complex organic composition provides outstanding storage capabilities for methane (clean and efficient unconventional natural gas), which leads to terrible gas outburst hazards. Minimizing the main storage sites of CH4 (micropores) through organic solvent extraction provides an efficient and safe route for exploiting coal and natural gas energy sources. This phenomenon can be elucidated by the removal of the chemical components that have an adverse impact on the micropore filling theory. In this study, we constructed macromolecular models of highly metamorphic coal, and relative dynamic simulations under experiment and field conditions are performed. The corresponding CH4 storage capacity and spatial coordination distribution of the coal after five treatments were derived. Combined with the results of the micropore filling theory, it was shown that the equilibrium distance of CH4 filling in the micropore increased with the degree of extraction (from 0.351 nm for XT to 0.572 nm for XT-DMF). Also, the trend of CH4 adsorption position in the representative samples (the number of monolayer affixations decreased from 10 to 9) provides crucial support for the conclusions, and the low-potential region with a high potential difference contributes to CH4 stability. The breakthrough of this study will provide strong support and a solid theoretical basis for the efficient and safe exploitation of CBM (Coalbed methane) energy resources.}

This study aims to build knowledge about students’ use of computational thinking and computer science concepts for problem solving when coding animated narratives. The research investigated students’ coding processes using data gathered from audio and device display recordings and semi-structured interviews. Results suggest limitations to the use of creative coding tasks if the expectation is to develop computational thinking and systematic problem solving strategies, or learn basic computer science concepts. They revealed that novice students rarely solved coding problems using optimal technically-based strategies despite being given explicit instruction on their use, opting instead to bypass problems by adjusting intended outcomes, or by using low level code translation strategies. Results demonstrate that engaging computational thinking or even demonstrating understanding of basic computer science concepts was not a requirement to produce a viable creative coding outcome. This study contributes new understanding of students’ coding practices when engaged in creative coding tasks in regular, non-specialist classrooms. Its findings challenge the commonly-held assumption that coding is a natural ‘vehicle’ to develop computational thinking and systematic approaches to problem solving. It also questions the learning that results from the non-technical, inefficient and often ineffective problem solving practices students employ during ‘creative coding’ tasks, that are frequently used by non-specialist teachers in response to curriculum requirements.}

The objective of this paper is to develop a community-centered approach by integrating rapid and participatory nature of design thinking with multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) in order to support sustainable development. While design thinking engages multiple stakeholders for generating alternatives, MCDA provides metrics for assessing these alternatives.

In order to prepare the next generation for a rapidly changing and unknown future heavily influenced by computing it thus seems necessary to focus on the professional development (PD) of teachers.

Initially, the paper gives an overview of nine educational initiatives in the field, followed by a closer examination of the Danish FabLab@SCHOOLdk organisation. The paper identifies the different PD programmes aimed at empowering in-service teachers, pedagogues, and principals in the field of DF and DT. As the main contribution to the research community, the study identifies five important stakeholders that are supporting and operating in synergy inside the FabLab@SCHOOLdk initiative as well as the surrounding gatekeepers with influence on the development processes. The paper further illustrates how the stakeholders operate in the organisation to enable educators to apply DF and DT in schools and discusses the development of professional practice in this field. Finally, a 1:1:1 -model for realising research-based suggestions in PD programmes is presented.}

It is thus essential to understand why some individuals get stuck in recurrent negative thinking (RNT), whereas others are able to disengage eventually. Theoretical models propose that individuals high in recurrent negative thinking suffer from deficits in controlling the contents of working memory. Empirical findings, however, are inconclusive. In this meta-analysis, we synthesize findings from 94 studies to examine the proposed association between RNT and deficits in cognitive control. We included numerous effect sizes not reported in the primary publications. Moderator analyses tested the influence of variables, such as stimuli valence, cognitive control function (e.g., shifting, discarding), or type of RNT (i.e., rumination or worry). Results demonstrated an association between repetitive negative thinking and deficits in only one specific cognitive control function, namely difficulty discarding no longer relevant material from working memory (r = −0.20). This association remained significant after controlling for level of psychopathology. There was no substantial association between RNT and deficits in any other cognitive control function. All other moderators were not significant. We discuss limitations (e.g., primary sample sizes, reliability of paradigms) and highlight implications for future research and clinical interventions.}

A posed problem involves a functional relationship when a mathematical function is the basis of the problem. We also found a mismatch between the problems that the students generated and those that their teachers predicted they would pose. Compared to the actual problems posed by the students, the problems predicted by the teachers were more likely to involve functional relationships about the pattern and less likely to involve a particular term in the pattern.

First, it was argued that divergent thinking tasks are similar to semantic fluency tasks, but are more constrained, and less well structured. Next, response time distributions from 54 participants were analyzed for temporal and semantic clustering. Participants responded to two prompts from the alternative uses test: uses for a brick and uses for a bottle, for two minutes each. Participants’ cumulative response curves were negatively accelerating, in line with theories of search of associative memory. However, results of analyses of semantic and temporal clustering suggested that clustering is less evident in alternative uses responding compared to semantic fluency tasks. This suggests either that divergent thinking responding does not involve an exhaustive search through a clustered memory trace, but rather that the process is more exploratory, yielding fewer overall responses that tend to drift away from close associates of the divergent thinking prompt.}

There are also gaps in the understanding of how young children manifest CT. With this paper, we contribute to the field by taking an action perspective with the CT of K-3 students. The analysis focus on iterative acts of abstraction and decomposition as a core process that elicits development of CT. We call these iterative acts the Abstraction/Decomposition spiral (AD spiral). By illustrating the AD spiral through the actions of two first grade students, the analysis shows how visual representation of an emerging solution, and the development of a plan are two important elements when young students solve problems in a coding context, developing their CT.}

The solution of this task suggests modelling the information exchange between active objects. Modelling is supposed to be carried out within the framework of the basic applicative computing system, in which the code fragments can be modelled by applicative objects. An important part of the task is to check the correctness of the scenarios composition, which requires the tools make compositional thinking about data flows, both when they are processed by scripts and contain them. The correctness is proposed to be provided by supporting the fairly strong typing system that excludes incorrect combinations of scenarios. The type system is assumed to be immersed into the applicative environment. The system is proposed to be built on the basis of the homotopy type theory, which ensures, in particular, the introduction of independent and dependent types, as well as the definition of recursion and induction principles for them. Partial approbation of typing constructions is performed with the example of the problem of semantic support for the implementation of the best available technologies (BAT).}

Participants were primed with creativity tasks that either called for divergent thinking—which were suspected to induce a holistic, flexible task processing mode, or convergent thinking—which were assumed to induce a systematic, focused processing mode. Participants showed reduced cross-talk between tasks and increased task-component switching costs (dual-task costs) for the convergent-thinking group compared to both, a divergent-thinking group and a neutral control group. The results suggest that the cognitive-control style people engage in prior to the task predicts their multitasking performance.}

abstract = {Smart devices in Industry 5.0, such as sensors and robots, are often limited by low battery life and finite computational resources, hindering their ability to perform complex tasks. By offloading computation-intensive tasks to Mobile Edge Cloud Computing (MEC) servers at the network’s edge, businesses can achieve real-time data processing and analysis, reducing communication latency, quicker response times, and improved system reliability. This work presents an integrated framework for MEC and Industry 5.0, aimed at enhancing the performance, efficiency, and flexibility of industrial processes. In particular, we propose a joint optimization problem that maximizes computational energy efficiency by optimally allocating resources, such as processing power and computational resources, as well as device association, in the most efficient manner possible. The problem is formulated as nonconvex/nonlinear, which is intractable and poses high complexity. To solve this challenging problem, we first transform and decouple the original optimization problem into a series of subproblems using the block coordinate descent method. Then, we iteratively obtain an efficient solution using convex optimization methods. In addition, our work sheds light on the fundamental trade-off between local computation and partial offloading schemes. The results show that for small data size requirements, the performance is comparable among different schemes. However, as data size increases, our proposed hybrid scheme, which includes a partial offloading scheme, outperforms others, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed joint optimization scheme.}

In this scenario, Society 5.0 (S5.0) is arising as a new paradigm that places humans at the centre of innovation. To foster the effective integration of technology into society and to better understand how to design S5.0 configurations and solutions, the authors developed a conceptual model applying the Design Thinking (DT) approach to the Quintuple Helix (QH) innovation framework. The proposed QH–DT model was found to be suitable for allowing the knowledge flow among the actors involved in the design and implementation of the S5.0 solution. The model was then explained through its application in a healthcare project—the SMARTAGE. By adopting an action research methodology, the results explain how it becomes possible to build complex human-centric healthcare solutions.}

We couple Life Cycle Thinking and Machine Learning to measure and assess the metabolic processes of the urban core of Lisbon's functional urban area using multidimensional indicators and measures incorporating urban ecosystem services dynamics. We built and trained a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network to identify the metabolic drivers and predict the metabolic changes for the near future (2025). The prediction model's performance was validated using the standard deviations of the prediction errors of the data subsets and the network's training graph. The simulated results show that the urban processes related to employment and unemployment rates (17%), energy systems (10%), sewage and waste management/treatment/recycling, demography & migration, hard/soft cultural assets, and air pollution (7%), education and training, welfare, cultural participation, and habitat-ecosystems (5%), urban safety, water systems, economy, housing quality, urban void, urban fabric, and health services and infrastructure (2%), consists the salient drivers for the urban metabolic changes.

Such behaviors exploit ambiguity and under-specification in language. Using loopholes is commonplace and intuitive in everyday social interaction, both familiar and consequential. Loopholes are also of concern in the law, and increasingly in artificial intelligence. However, the computational and cognitive underpinnings of loopholes are not well understood. Here, we propose a utility-theoretic recursive social reasoning model that formalizes and accounts for loophole behavior. The model captures the decision process of a loophole-aware listener, who trades off their own utility with that of the speaker, and considers an expected social penalty for non-cooperative behavior. The social penalty is computed through the listener’s recursive reasoning about a virtual naive observer’s inference of a naive listener’s social intent. Our model captures qualitative patterns in previous data, and also generates new quantitative predictions consistent with novel studies (N = 265). We consider the broader implications of our model for other aspects of social reasoning, including plausible deniability and humor.}

Although this heuristic bias is well documented and widely featured in psychology textbooks, its precise nature is less clear. A key question is whether reasoners detect the biased nature of their judgments. My research is focusing on this detection process. In a nutshell, results indicate that despite their illogical response, people demonstrate a remarkable sensitivity to possible conflict between their heuristic judgment and elementary logical or probabilistic principles. In this chapter, I present a detailed overview of the empirical studies that I have run and discuss theoretical implications. I will clarify why the empirical detection findings have led me to hypothesize that people not only have heuristic intuitions but also logical intuitions. I also explore implications for ongoing debates concerning our view of human rationality (“Are humans blind and ignorant heuristic thinkers?”), dual process theories of reasoning (“How do intuitive and deliberate thinking interact?”), and the nature of individual differences in bias susceptibility (“when and why do biased and unbiased reasoners start to diverge?”).}

The aim of this study is to identify the factors that influence the creation of innovative ideas. We conducted two different types of workshops with 22 subjects and 23 subjects each. In the first workshop, subjects were asked to generate new business ideas through analogical thinking. As a result, half of the participants generated appropriate ideas, and three influential factors were determined: categorization skill, deliberation, and trial and error. The second workshop was designed to facilitate participants to enhance these three factors. As a result, 70% of the participants could generate appropriate ideas.

We argue that looking at co-speech gestures might broaden the scope and shed new light on different thinking-for-speaking patterns. Data comes from a corpus study investigating the relationship between speech and gesture in two typologically different languages: Danish, a satellite-framed language and Italian, a verb-framed language. Results show cross-linguistic variation in how motion components are mapped onto linguistic constituents, but also show how Italian speakers to some degree deviate from standard verb-framed lexicalization patterns, and use typical satellite-framed constructions. Co-speech gestures, when they occur, largely follow the patterns used in speech, with a notable exception: In 28% of the cases, in fact, Italian speakers express manner in path-only speech constructions gesturally. This finding suggests that gestures may be instrumental in revealing what semantic components speakers attend to while speaking; in other words, purely verbal data may not fully account for the thinking part of the thinking-for-speaking hypothesis.}

Further functional enrichment analysis showed that these DT-related gene co-expression network modules were enriched for key biological process and cellular component related to myelination, suggesting that cortical and sub-cortical grey matter myelination may serve as important neurobiological basis of DT.

Here, we systematically and qualitatively reviewed 27 studies on the associations between EF (e.g., shifting, inhibition, working memory) and RNT (e.g., rumination, worry, obsessions) in youth. All forms of RNT were more commonly positively associated with questionnaire-reported EF problems in daily life, most frequently in the domain of shifting. Task-based assessments of EF were less consistently associated with RNT in youth, with no strong pattern of presence vs. absence of associations. Further, limited longitudinal work has been conducted on this topic to date. This review integrates initial work with regard to RNT and EF deficits in a still-developing population, and discusses clear future need for longitudinal, multi-method assessments of the relationship between RNT and EF subtypes in youth.}

abstract = {This paper presents a review of computational toys and kits that enable young children (ages 7 years old and under) to explore computational ideas and practices. We collected 30 computational kits, including 13 physical kits, 8 virtual kits, and 9 hybrid kits, and performed a qualitative analysis of these kits. We examined the kits across four different perspectives: how they are designed, how they support children to explore computational concepts and practices, how they enable children to engage in a range of projects and activities, and how they enable children to explore other domains of knowledge. Based on the analysis, we present design suggestions and opportunities to expand the possibilities in what computational ideas and other domains of knowledge children can explore, how children can engage in computing, and what kinds of projects children can make. While many kits enable the exploration of some computational concepts and practices, we see opportunities to expand how these concepts can be supported, as well as the new concepts and domains children could explore. We also see possibilities to include new modes of expression such as body motion or new media such as light and sound. Finally, we see possibilities for whom designers can better support, such as more explicit roles for adult caregivers and expanding possibilities for children from underrepresented groups in computing. This qualitative study reveals the commonalities across existing kits and highlights ways for designers and researchers to expand the possibilities for children to create, explore, and play with computing.}

abstract = {Hillslopes are the fundamental building blocks of catchments, however, fully disentangling their hydrological response remains an outstanding challenge. In natural settings, hillslope hydrology is challenged by the interplay of several factors, such as, heterogeneous morphology, vegetation, and complex soils. Herein, we attempt to clarify the mechanisms that control the rainfall-runoff relationship by investigating the response of an artificial outdoor slope setup with uniform geometry, soil properties, topography, and in the absence of vegetation located in a Mediterranean climate. Based on the analysis of more than 100 storms across six consecutive hydrological years, our results demonstrate that either pre-event soil water content or rainfall conditions alone are not sufficient to explain the slope response. Seasonality played a major role through soil moisture conditions, and pre-event soil moisture, peak rainfall intensity and rainfall duration influenced the slope runoff response. Observations suggest that in fall and winter subsurface flow was the prevalent runoff mechanism, while infiltration excess overland flow mostly occurred in the dry season. Our findings show that continuous measurement of runoff could be beneficial to understand the peak rainfall-peak runoff relationship.}

We examine extreme thinking among 327 adolescents (mean age=14.56, 57% female, 75% White) who received cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), fluoxetine (FLX), or a combination of CBT and FLX (COMB). Among those who met remission status on the Children’s Depression Rating Scale – Revised (CDRS-R≤28; 56 at week 12, 79 at week 18) extreme thinking did not predict failure to maintain remission. This is in contrast to findings with depressed adults. Treatment influenced level of extreme thinking, and this appeared to be driven by greater endorsement of positively valenced beliefs as opposed to a decrease in negatively valenced beliefs. Developmental or investigation characteristics may account for the discrepancy in findings.}

The aim of this paper is to review previous studies on the relationship between GIScience and spatial thinking, and to clarify the elements of spatial thinking and related terms. After discussing the basic elements of spatial thinking, it explores the relationship between GIScience and spatial thinking by dividing it into two aspects: the role of geographic information systems (GIS) in education on spatial thinking, and the role of spatial thinking in GIScience. Concerning the former, potential roles of GIS in spatial thinking education, particularly in geography and STEM disciplines, are suggested. Concerning the latter, the relationships between the body of knowledge on GIS education and the elements of spatial thinking are examined. Finally, the present situation and future prospects for studies on spatial thinking and GIScience in Japan are briefly discussed.}

None of the many conceptual paradigms that have been proposed so far to explain it has turned out entirely satisfactory. We argue that the main reason behind this failure is the implicit linear thinking that informs all these approaches: namely, the idea that a few, major drivers explain urban development through a direct, clearly readable systemic impact. Cities are complex socio-environmental systems whose functioning depends on the concurrent interaction of many different factors which cannot be reduced to the action of a few, simple causal forces. Failing to understand such complexity easily leads to dysfunctional urban governance approaches. In this paper, we analyze a database of 144 European cities as described by 58 variables belonging to different domains, as designed by a preliminary stage of the Cultural and Creative City Monitor (CCCM). Our analysis builds on innovative machine learning techniques (PST) and on the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) representation to map the structural interdependencies between the cultural and non-cultural sectors in cities with a strong cultural policy orientation. This toolbox carries considerable potential for precision cultural policies and data-driven urban governance strategies of the future.}

These hypotheses and plans can be transmitted independently of their original motivations, adapted across generations, and serve as an engine of cultural evolution. Here, we review recent empirical and computational research underlying goal generation and planning and discuss the ways that the flexibility of our motivational system supports cognitive gains for both individuals and societies.}

abstract = {There exists a large body of literature seeking to understand the relation between math anxiety and success in mathematics. While most of this literature focuses on domain specific relations (i.e., how math anxiety impacts thinking about mathematics), in the current work we examine important relations between math anxiety and domain general factors. Specifically, we test three hypotheses: (1) that higher-math-anxious individuals have a lower need for and enjoyment of exerting cognitive effort, (2) that math anxiety mediates a relation between ones’ propensity for cognitive effort and their achievement in mathematics, and (3) that higher-math-anxious individuals are less reflective in their thinking, and that this is not limited to questions that are heavily reliant on mathematical reasoning. As predicted, we uncovered relations between math anxiety and the domain-general constructs of need for cognition and cognitive reflection. Importantly, these negative relations hold even after controlling for math ability, general anxiety, and gender of the participant. The results are discussed in terms of implications for our understanding of the construct of math anxiety. Proficiency in mathematics is a major advantage in industrialised nations. Unfortunately, many people experience math-anxiety (Richardson & Suinn, 1972), becoming nervous when engaging in math tasks and avoiding math and math-related professions. As a result, those with math anxiety tend to severely limit their future career and earning opportunities (Chipman, Krantz, & Silver, 1992; Hembree, 1990). The resulting shortage of adults prepared to work in the sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics field (STEM) has negative consequences at the national level, particularity as societies become increasingly dependent upon technology (Beilock & Maloney, 2015; Chipman et al., 1992; Maloney & Beilock, 2012). Worldwide, increased math-anxiety is linked to decreased math achievement (Foley et al., 2017; Lee, 2009), and this is not limited to academic situations. Math-anxious nurses, for example, are more likely than non-math-anxious nurses to make poor drug calculations (Mcmullan, Jones, & Lea, 2012); math-anxious women are more likely than their peers to engage in poor financial planning (McKenna & Nickols, 1988), and math anxiety is negatively linked to the ability to interpret health statistics (Silk & Parrott, 2014). Given that math-anxiety is related to important and detrimental consequences in people’s daily lives, it is vital that we work to understand the behavioural and cognitive differences between those who are high and low in math-anxiety.}

This leaves the co-design and implementation of CS education open to emergent directions and possibilities. Using a descriptive case study methodology, we detail trading zones in two different co-design projects that sought to situate CS education in relationship to cultural contexts through multi-directional exchanges of resources and knowledge: (1) a co-design project in a youth boxing gym with coaches, mentors, and staff; (2) a co-design project in a high school barbering program with a barbering instructor and barbering students. Our findings show that the metaphor is useful for the concept of computational empowerment in ways that are reflexive and interventionist.}

But these innovations have focused on easier-to-quantify variables, like personnel selection, training, teaming, and crowd aggregation—bypassing messier constructs, like qualitative properties of forecasters’ rationales. Here, we adapt methods from natural language processing (NLP) and computational text analysis to identify distinctive reasoning strategies in the rationales of top forecasters, including: (a) cognitive styles, such as dialectical complexity, that gauge tolerance of clashing perspectives and efforts to blend them into coherent conclusions and (b) the use of comparison classes or base rates to inform forecasts. In addition to these core metrics, we explore metrics derived from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program. Applying these tools to multiple tournaments and to forecasters of widely varying skill (from Mechanical Turkers to carefully culled “superforecasters”) revealed that: (a) top forecasters show higher dialectical complexity in their rationales and use more comparison classes; (b) experimental interventions, like training and teaming, that boost accuracy also influence NLP profiles of rationales, nudging them in a “superforecaster” direction.}

The Adaptive Learning strategic Bidding System (ALBidS) is a multiagent system created to provide decision support to market negotiating players. Fully integrated with MASCEM, ALBidS considers several different strategic methodologies based on highly distinct approaches. Six Thinking Hats (STH) is a powerful technique used to look at decisions from different perspectives, forcing the thinker to move outside its usual way of thinking. This paper aims to complement the ALBidS strategies by combining them and taking advantage of their different perspectives through the use of the STH group decision technique. The combination of ALBidS' strategies is performed through the application of a genetic algorithm, resulting in an evolutionary learning approach.}

Decision-making based on such scenarios bears the risk of missing undesired impacts on specific groups of people, which may cause social tensions or require costly countermeasures. New approaches are needed to provide a better basis for socially responsible planning by making clearer the complex social impacts of future scenarios. In marketing and user-centered design, persona models are developed to represent typologies of users to cover a broad range of needs and requirements. We propose a systematic method, called the Scenario Personarrative method, for combining scenario thinking and personas into a structured but nonetheless flexible process, which allows generating fine-grained individualized narratives. We describe a pilot application in a case study on urban mobility. This pilot used existing scenarios and focused on a two-hour workshop where twelve experts created personas and the associated narratives across three scenarios of urban mobility in 2030. This pilot shows the applicability of the method for making potential effects on different social groups more tangible. We propose ways forward for further evaluation of the proposed methodology.}

abstract = {This study examined the effects of two pre-determined accommodations that were provided in a standardized testing. The two accommodations were meant to help students with difficulties in mathematics (SDMs) engage in unit thinking, reasoning, and coordination and consequently improve their ability to process fraction tasks. 23 middle school SDMs took the following tests and were asked to explain their solutions: a baseline fraction test without any accommodation; an annotated test with bolded information and additional simplified explanations; and a warming- up test that involved whole-number multiplicative reasoning tasks followed by the baseline test. Results show that while SDMs were able to construct and coordinate fraction units to solve fraction problems when appropriate accommodations were provided, standardized assessment with a predetermined “one-size-fits -all” accommodation could not meet the specific needs of all students with mathematics learning difficulties.}

abstract = {Charles S. Peirce developed a process philosophy featuring a non-theistic agapistic evolution from nothingness. It is an Eastern inspired alternative to the Western mechanical ontology of classical science also inspired by the American transcendentalists. Advaitism and Buddhism are the two most important Eastern philosophical traditions that encompass scientific knowledge and the idea of spontaneous evolutionary development. This article attempts to show how Peirce's non-mechanistic triadic semiotic process theory is suited better to embrace the quantum field view than mechanistic and information-based views are with regard to a theory of the emergence of consciousness. Peirce views the universe as a reasoning process developing from pure potentiality to the fully ordered rational Summon Bonum. The paper compares this with John Archibald Wheeler's “It from bit” cosmogony based on quantum information science, which leads to the info-computational view of nature, mind and culture. However, this theory lacks a phenomenological foundation. David Chalmers' double aspect interpretation of information attempts to overcome the limitations of the info-computational view. Chalmers supplements Batesonian and Wheelerian info-computationalism – both of which lack a phenomenological aspect - with a dimension that corresponds to the phenomenological aspect of reality. However, he does not manage to produce an integrated theory of the development of meaning and rationality. Alex Hankey's further work goes some way towards establishing a theory that can satisfy Husserl's criteria for consciousness - such as a sense of being and time - but Hankey's dependence on Chalmers' theory is still not able to account for what the connection between core consciousness and the physical world is.}

abstract = {This paper reports on an aspect of the EC funded Argunaut project which researched and developed awareness tools for moderators of online dialogues. In this study we report on an investigation into the nature of creative thinking in online dialogues and whether or not this creative thinking can be coded for and recognized automatically such that moderators can be alerted when creative thinking is occurring or when it has not occurred after a period of time. We outline a dialogic theory of creativity, as the emergence of new perspectives from the interplay of voices, and the testing of this theory using a range of methods including a coding scheme which combined coding for creative thinking with more established codes for critical thinking, artificial intelligence pattern-matching techniques to see if our codes could be read automatically from maps and ‘key event recall’ interviews to explore the experience of participants. Our findings are that: (1) the emergence of new perspectives in a graphical dialogue map can be recognized by our coding scheme supported by a machine pattern-matching algorithm in a way that can be used to provide awareness indicators for moderators; (2) that the trigger events leading to the emergence of new perspectives in the online dialogues studied were most commonly disagreements and (3) the spatial representation of messages in a graphically mediated synchronous dialogue environment such as Digalo may offer more affordance for creativity than the much more common scrolling text chat environments. All these findings support the usefulness of our new account of creativity in online dialogues based on dialogic theory and demonstrate that this account can be operationalised through machine coding in a way that can be turned into alerts for moderators.}

abstract = {Analysis of the impact of interaction and experience on quality components such as “usability”, “producibility”, “reliability”, “sustainability” and “aesthetics” is presented using the case of engineering design, a discipline that traditionally has an image of being a strictly calculated, rigid framework. It has been widely recognised that engineering design encompasses two ways of thinking—creative and critical. A central argument that the synergy of creativity and criticality is significantly enhanced by connecting true interdisciplinary augmentation with the fine arts is discussed along with reflecting on the importance of such an approach in higher education.}
