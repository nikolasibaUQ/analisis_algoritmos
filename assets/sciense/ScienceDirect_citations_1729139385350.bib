abstract = {One of the research domains in the field of sentiment analysis is automatic emotion recognition in texts which is a worthy topic in human-computer interaction. Text processing has always faced many challenges. The main one is the structural and semantic differences of sentences which have had a significant impact on the malfunction of auto-recognition systems. This problem becomes more prominent in short texts in which words and their concurrences are limited and insufficient. As a result of this, word frequency and TF-IDF weighing cannot well represent the relationship between words and the appropriate feature vector, leading to an undesirable accuracy of emotion recognition. Thus, different strategies should be applied to improve the feature vector and to formulate the features properly. The desired strategy should be able to identify the words that can distinguish between classes well and also to find the relationships between words and meaningful phrases using natural language processing concepts. In this paper, a combination of emotional models, categorical and hierarchical, are used for an emotional text recognition which could discover simultaneously explicit and implicit emotion in a short text. Our approach called DuFER, proposed a weighed method which improves the feature vector using language models and computational linguistics through applying a modified TF-IDF weighing to words as well as Maximum Likelihood Estimation weighing to expressions. Four implicit and explicit emotion datasets are used for the experiments. The results show that the accuracy of both implicit and explicit emotion recognition has increased and DuFER is actually the first successful dual framework in recognizing implicit and explicit emotions from text.}

This note provides an alternative algorithm that is simple, requires much less computational memory, and is substantially faster than the standard algorithm.}

Additionally, a subsample of 111 participants completed a resting-state fMRI scan. After investigating the impact of age on different divergent thinking metrics, we investigated the impact of age on the association between divergent thinking and resting-state functional connectivity within and between major resting-state brain networks associated with creative thinking: the DMN, ECN, and SN. Adolescents tended to be less creative than both young and older adults in divergent thinking scores related to expansion creativity, and not in persistent creativity, while young and older adults performed relatively similar. We found that adolescents’ functional integrity of the executive control network (ECN) was positively associated with expansion creativity, which was significantly different from the negative association in both the young and older adults. These results suggest that creative performance and supporting brain networks change throughout the lifespan.}

Faced with this growing heterogeneity, there is the need to advance understanding of the organisations that engage in innovation intermediation activities. To do so, we use a combination of text mining and bibliometric techniques, and we identify seven different streams of literature, six of which refer to distinct types of intermediaries that perform specific functions and often involve specific types of organisations. Looking at the evolution of the different streams of literature over time, we find that the early contributions focused on university incubators, science and technology parks, and the role they play within different types of innovation systems. More recently, the focus has shifted to the role of intermediaries in supporting sustainable transitions. Despite the differences between the various types of intermediaries and the literature streams that analyse them, the bibliographic coupling shows that all strands of literature have a common theoretical basis, which includes the open innovation approach and revolves around the role of science parks and incubators.}

It was hypothesized that these measures would reveal the engagement of local and increasingly complex cortical networks as a function of task specificity and complexity. Results indicated regionally increased neuronal signalling as a function of task complexity at frontal, temporal and parietal brain regions, although more robust task-related changes in EEG-indices of activation were derived over the left hemisphere. Both linear and non-linear indices of synchronization among EEG signals recorded from over different brain regions were consistent with the notion of more “local” processing for the number comparison task. Conversely, multiplication tasks were associated with a widespread pattern of distant signal synchronizations, which could potentially indicate increased demands for neural networks cooperation during performance of tasks that involve a greater number of cognitive operations.}

Detecting violation of a liveness predicate requires that the predicate be evaluated on an infinite computation. In this work, we develop the theory and associated algorithms for predicate detection in infinite runs. In practice, an infinite run can be determined in finite time if it consists of a recurrent behavior with some finite prefix. Therefore, our study is restricted to such runs. We introduce the concept of d-diagram, which is a finite representation of infinite directed graphs. Given a d-diagram that represents an infinite distributed computation, we solve the problem of determining if a global predicate ever became true in the computation. The crucial aspect of this problem is the stopping rule that tells us when to conclude that the predicate can never become true in future. We also provide an algorithm to provide vector timestamps to events in the computation for determining the dependency relationship between any two events in the infinite run. Finally, we give an algorithm to compute a slice of a d-diagram which concisely captures all the consistent global states of the computation satisfying the given predicate.}

abstract = {Computational experiment approach considers modelling as the essential feature of Inquiry-Based Science Education (IBSE) where the model and the computer take the place of the “classical” experimental set-up and simulation replaces the experiment (Landau, Páez, & Bordeianu, 2008). Modelling, as a pedagogical tool, involves the model construction, the exploration of model characteristics and the model application to a specific problem, resembling authentic activities of scientists and mathematicians (Herbert, 2003). Jonassen and Strobel (2006) state that in addition to modelling domain knowledge, learners can apply modelling skills in different ways: by modelling domain knowledge, by modelling problems (constructing problem spaces), by modelling systems and by modelling semantic structures. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of the Computational Experiment Mathematical Modelling (CEMM) approach on University students': a) reasoning abilities, b) learning performance, c) epistemological beliefs, and d) argumentation. Students worked in a learning environment which contained applications in Physics created by the author and all of them were based on mathematical models, as the model was considered as the fundamental unit of instruction (Hestenes, 1999). Fifty (50) pre-service primary school university students participated in this project and results indicated a strong relationship between students' learning performance, performance in the scientific reasoning abilities test, epistemic beliefs and the ability to use arguments during computational experiments. This paper suggests an implementable integration strategy that uses mathematical models for physics phenomena that are developed using algorithms, aiming to deepen students' conceptual understanding and scientific reasoning. After completing the course, the mechanics baseline test (MBT) and a test on Heat were administered. The results indicated that there was a significant difference in problem-solving skill test mean scores, as measured by the MBT, and the test on Heat among concrete, formal and postformal reasoners. Overall, this study provides evidence that scientific reasoning has a strong impact to learning performance, scientific reasoning, epistemological beliefs and argumentation while the methodology of the Computational Experiment provides essential tools to students to implement Inquiry based scenario. Students developed their scenarios using an open source repository using the computational experiment approach and created their experiments using the Argument-Driven Inquiry (ADI) laboratory approach. Results have implications for the effectiveness of the computational experiment as a methodology to be included in the STEM agenda.}

This study aims to explore a range of research methods in order to enhance the performance of integrated design with a comprehensive planning stage. The integration in evaluation across professions and subject boundaries is emphasised to identify the key gaps between sustainability and design. The main method of this study is the application of CFD and EcoTect tools for environmental performance of a larger urban area than the common use for architectural interventions or immediate outdoor spaces of a project. This study suggests an integrated urban design model with the application of computational tools (i.e. CFD and EcoTect in here) and how these could inform, from a technical dimension, a more comprehensive approach to executing best practice in design and planning. The paper concludes by suggesting an integrated model of urban design to achieve urban sustainability.}

More specifically, we show how to improve existing voting-based ensemble models trained to predict the next-day exchange rate trend with no need for retraining or other costly computational tasks. We assume that calendar effects would constrain investors’ actions; furthermore, their constrained individual actions would collectively induce deterministic patterns in the financial time-series movement. Hence, financial time-series forecasting models could be prone to monthly repeat their performance patterns, and we could use this information to obtain better predictions and consistently achieve profit. To verify the effectiveness of our methodology, we predicted the sign of the US Dollar to Brazilian Real rate variation. Our proposed models generated a profit metric value 24% higher than the original voting-based ensemble models with 16% lower volatility, gathering two positive elements: higher return with lower risk. The experiments’ outcomes supported the hypothesis that there are considerable improvements with almost no extra computational effort by taking into account behavioral patterns in foreign exchange predictions.}

To evaluate the suitability of this framework, the model has been extended by incorporating therapeutical interventions for four different types of therapy. The obtained intervention models have been used to model and compare different therapies for a variety of patient types by simulation experiments and by formal verification. Simulation experiments are reported showing that the mood regulation and depression indeed follow expected patterns when applying these therapies.

Creative self-efficacy, Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking Figural (TTCT-Figural), and assessment of the students’ robotic creative products were conducted to evaluate students’ creativity. In addition, t tests, ANCOVA, and ANOVA were used to analyze the data to determine whether REP could improve students’ creativity better than PBP. The results showed that REP could enhance students’ creative self-efficacy and their robotic creative products score more than PBP could, but not the TTCT-Figural score after the confounding effect of fluency was controlled for. In the intervention group, creative self-efficacy and creative thinking were improved after intervention. Overall, REP has more advantages than PBP for promoting primary school students' creativity.

One is ‘epistemization’, making computational tasks refer explicitly to knowledge or beliefs of the agents performing them. The other line is using games as a model for computation, leading to ‘gamification’ of classical tasks, and computing by agents that may have preferences. This provides ingredients for a fundamental theory of computation that shifts from what is computed to how it is computed and by whom, moving from output to social behavior. The true impact of this shift is not in learning how to replace humans, but in creating new societies where humans and machines interact. While we do not offer a Turing-style account of this richer world, we discuss what becomes of three classical themes: the Universal Machine, Church's Thesis and the Turing Test.1}

abstract = {This pilot EEG mapping study was designed to explore thinking processes using complex mental imagery and thought processes. EEG was recorded with 19 electrodes (10/20 system against averaged ear lobe signals) while volunteers (n = 42) performed two separate tasks: visualization of an abstract concept and interpretation of a painting. Average spectral parameters such as amplitude, local and interhemispheric coherences were computed for five frequency bands (theta, alpha, beta 1, 2 and 3). Results indicate that the frontal regions are strongly involved during these tasks as evidenced by coherence changes. Changes are also present in temporal, parietal and occipital regions and are discussed in relation to information processing with the frontal regions considering the different cognitive functions required by the tasks.}

In contrast to design’s past defined by a lack of accessible data, today’s rapidly evolving age of data abundance informs the choices available—the decision space—with far-reaching consequences for organizational, social, and environmental well-being. The shifting design landscape requires new tools and techniques to navigate this data age effectively. This paper proposes a new curricular approach that intersects data, technology, and design to create an environment where students can evaluate their roles and impact, and interact effectively through data with humans and computational collaborators. This data-oriented curriculum includes foundational technical skills proficiency, data analytical skills, rhetorical skills for arguing with data, interdisciplinary design studies, and a focus on designing for society. It embraces the complexities and opportunities of the data age, and acknowledges the inherent uncertainty in this new landscape. The aim is to prepare the next generation of designers to create data-informed, human-centered, ethical, and sustainable designs, thereby fostering an inclusive, equitable, and sustainable future.}

The cross-domain approach revealed similarities in design practice through four design themes: visualization, ‘conversations’ with materials, co-creation and ‘pushing boundaries’. The data also revealed innovations within the four themes that could apply to other design domains, for example visualization (haute couture) and co-creation (haute cuisine). The practitioners also provided valuable and nuanced insights into their design practice – ‘You have to live something to do it’. These insights from practitioners and their practice reveal how the two domains hold similarities in design practice and provide a deeper understanding of design processes, and designerly thinking, from which creativity and innovation can emerge.}

The modern way of thinking poses a challenge against the dichotomy between the natural world and social world, by taking into account the concepts around complexity, evolution and order. This study provides an overview encompassing multi-chaos, fractal, fractional and Artificial Intelligence (AI) way of thinking for the solution of the complex system problems concerned with natural and social sciences. Furthermore, ethical decision-making frameworks and strategies concerning big data and AI applications to provide assistance for the identification of the related problems in different settings and help thinking in a methodical manner with a deliberative compensating process so that tensions between conflicting aspects can be managed systematically. The values related to ethical issues, which are thorny in nature, point to being practical, flexible and problem-driven rather than purely theory-driven in order that dilemmas can be addressed and critical decision-making guided in a way beyond theoretical positions with a focus on applied aspects. Through the lenses of such transformative thinking along with mathematics-informed frameworks encompassing chaos, fractal and multi-fractional ways, the incorporation of technology, with Artificial Intelligence, as the most viable and far-reaching leg, is essentially required to be able to address and tackle complexity that has chaotic, nonlinear, and dynamic characteristics. Hence, optimized solutions can be conceived and implemented efficiently and in a facilitating way with some required degree of flexibility as well. Considering the impact and ubiquity of data technologies concerning all aspects of modern life, it becomes important to establish a balance between data use and ethical matters. Computational technologies in different complex systems based on mathematical-driven informed frameworks can enable the generation of more realistic and applicable adaptive models under transient, dynamic and ever-evolving conditions of different complex systems.}

In the cardiovascular field, this technology has contributed to improve the management of complex cases, in particular congenital heart disease, by fostering personalized preprocedural planning and increasing medical trainees’ confidence. Cardiovascular structures, however, are extremely challenging to replicate using materials compatible with current 3D printing technologies. Hence, patient-specific computational models, generated from the same set of medical images as printed ones, can be combined to 3D printing technology to simulate different conditions and identify the optimal treatment for each specific patient. A further step forward is represented by the integration of advanced visualization techniques like augmented and virtual reality, to close still existing loopholes. In this chapter, we review the current possibilities associated with the use of patient-specific models, in the context of cardiovascular applications.}

abstract = {Incorporating energy storage systems (ESSs) can mitigate the intermittency of renewable energy sources. There are a variety of ESSs for renewable energy with vastly different characteristics. The problem of diversity of characteristics in selecting the most appropriate ESS can be approached as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. This research evaluates sustainable ESSs through a case study in Egypt. A sustainable computational approach is presented through which experts can use verbal expressions to express their opinions in determining the priorities of the dimensions that affect the selection of ESSs. Determining the appropriate energy storage system requires consideration of several main dimensions such as the technology dimension, environmental dimension, economic dimension, and social-political dimension and, in addition to the sub-indicators. Hence, this research applies a hybrid MCDM approach that deals with different indicators and characteristics. Also, uncertainty in applying the proposed approach was dealt with by a spherical fuzzy (SF) environment and by using the spherical fuzzy numbers (SFNs). At first, the SF analytical hierarchy process (SF-AHP) method was used to assess the priorities of the four main dimensions and their sub-indicators. Then, the SF mixed aggregation by comprehensive normalization technique (SF-MACONT) was applied to evaluate and rank the ESSs selected for analysis through research. An illustrative case study was presented that included seven ESSs out of the eighteen systems listed in the research to confirm the feasibility of the developed approach. Sensitivity analysis was carried out by changing some parameters like λ, μ, δ, and ϑ based on the SF-MACONT method and changing the weights of some main dimensions. A comparative analysis with some MCDM approaches was conducted to show the advantages of the developed approach through its flexibility and built-in parameters. The findings show that the technology dimension is the most influential in choosing a sustainable ESS, while the economic dimension is the least influential. Also, the results of the evaluation and ranking of the seven selected ESSs indicate that the "Pumped Hydro" system is the most suitable system for energy storage in Egypt.}

This analysis illustrates the multidisciplinary research and collaborations among scientific communities, by constructing static and dynamic networks from the topic modelling results and from the authors’ keywords. The results of this study provide insights regarding the past and future trends of core discussion topics in computational science and show how “computational thinking” has propagated across different fields of study. We used the Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) topic modelling algorithm to discover topics. The resulting topics were then manually labelled and grouped hierarchically on three levels. Next, we applied trend analysis and Change Point Analysis (CPA) to study the evolution of topics over seventeen years and to identify the growing and disappearing topics. We used Gephi to examine the static networks of topics, and an R library called DyA to analyse the dynamic networks of topics. We also analysed the conference as a platform for potential collaboration development through the perspective of collaboration networks. The results show that authors of ICCS papers continue to actively collaborate after the conference − on average authors collaborate with three other ICCS authors, − which suggests that ICCS is a valuable platform for collaboration development.}

In this paper, we give a couple of examples for algorithm synthesis using the lazy thinking paradigm. These examples illustrate how the synthesized algorithm depends on the algorithm scheme used.

This phenomenon, referred to as the temporal discounting sign effect, is thought to result from the greater anticipated emotional impact of waiting for a negative outcome (dread) compared to waiting for a positive outcome (mixture of savoring and impatience). The impact of such anticipatory emotions has been proposed to rely on episodic future thinking. We evaluated this proposal by examining the presence and magnitude of a sign effect in the intertemporal decisions of individuals with hippocampal amnesia, who are severely impaired in their ability to engage in episodic mental simulation, and by comparing their patterns of choices to those of healthy controls. We also measured loss aversion, the tendency to assign greater value to losses compared to equivalent gains, to verify that any reduction in the sign effect in the hippocampal lesion group could not be explained by a group difference in loss aversion. Results showed that participants with hippocampal amnesia exhibited a sign effect, with less discounting of monetary losses compared to gains, that was similar in magnitude to that of controls. Loss aversion, albeit greater in the hippocampal compared to the control group, did not account for the sign effect. These results indicate that the sign effect does not depend on the integrity of hippocampally mediated episodic processes. They suggest instead that the impact of anticipatory emotions can be factored into decisions via semantic future thinking, drawing on non-contextual knowledge about oneself.}

The review presents empirical investigations with young learners and reports on relevant frameworks and curriculum programs, effects of teaching approaches and educational tools on learning, and learning outcomes and pedagogical benefits of teaching programming. Based on the empirical studies reviewed in this study, programming can be introduced to young learners as a stand-alone subject matter or can be integrated in the regular kindergarten curriculum with other subject areas such as music, movement and dance, art, science, mathematics, and literacy. In addition, programming can be infused in literacy and storytelling activities as a developmentally appropriate delivery approach. The authors conclude that future research should devote time and effort in the development of educational curricula in which the teaching of programming is fully integrated, as well as teacher training programs so that teachers become competent to teach programming in early childhood education.}

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating condition with no known effective drug treatments. Existing drugs only alleviate symptoms. Given repeated expensive drug failures, we assessed systematically whether approved and investigational AD drugs are targeting products of genes strongly associated with AD and whether these genes are targeted by existing drugs for other indications which could be re-purposed.
Methods
We identified genes strongly associated with late-onset AD from the loci of genetic variants associated with AD at genome-wide-significance and from a gene-based test applied to the most extensively genotyped late-onset AD case (n = 17,008)-control (n = 37,154) study, the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project. We used three gene-to-drug cross-references, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Drugbank and Drug Repurposing Hub, to identify genetically validated targets of AD drugs and any existing drugs or nutraceuticals targeting products of the genes strongly associated with late-onset AD.
Findings
A total of 67 autosomal genes (forming 9 gene clusters) were identified as strongly associated with late-onset AD, 28 from the loci of single genetic variants, 51 from the gene-based test and 12 by both methods. Existing approved or investigational AD drugs did not target products of any of these 67 genes. Drugs for other indications targeted 11 of these genes, including immunosuppressive disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs targeting PTK2B gene products.
Interpretation
Approved and investigational AD drugs are not targeting products of genes strongly associated with late-onset AD. However, other drugs targeting products of these genes exist and could perhaps be re-purposing to combat late-onset AD after further scrutiny.}

Instead of hypothetically traveling through the branches of a decision tree, it is suggested, people suspend judgement and remain at the node. This interpretation is applied to instances of decision making, information search, deductive and inductive reasoning, probabilistic judgement, games, puzzles and paradoxes. Some implications of the reluctance to think through disjunctions, as well as potential corrective procedures, are discussed.}

Sample consisted of 240 secondary school students (98 females and 142 males; grades 5–7). Two scales were used to collect data: STEM Attitude Scale and Robotics Attitude Scale. The data were analyzed using a One-way MANOVA and through correlational methods. Results show that the students’ attitudes towards robotics and STEM were positive. Gender had no effect on STEM attitudes. However, in terms of robotics attitudes, female students had significantly less desire and less confidence to learn robotics than male students. There was no gender effect on computational thinking and teamwork. Implications were discussed in terms of theoretical insights, practices for educational robotics in STEM, and directions for further research.}

This paper, however, indicates some respects in which this suggestion is inaccurate. Computability theory has not been focused exclusively on Turing-equivalent computation. Many essential features of Turing-equivalent computation are not captured in definitions of computation as (digital) symbol manipulation. Turing-equivalent computation did not play the role in McCulloch and Pitts’s early cybernetic work that is sometimes attributed to it. Finally, various segments of the neuroscientific community invoke a notion of computation that differs from the Turing-equivalent notion.}

abstract = {In recent years, online MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) have been quite popular among universities which helps learners to enhance their competency skills apart from learning the regular college/university curriculum. Although distance education and online learning have been adopted gradually recently, it has become the 'New Normal.' In this situation of uncertainty, facilitators must keep themselves updated with the various teaching/learning strategies and encourage learners to get accustomed to the online classroom environment. Furthermore, assisting the learners with active engagement in the classes is essential. Hence, to create an instigated environment for assessing the competency level and addressing the motivational behaviour of the learners in the online courses, a modified version of the "ARCS" (Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction) model is used in this research work. The core objective of this model is to apply a modified motivational model, namely "ARCS-PC," where PC represents Professional Competency. Professional competency includes Critical Thinking skills, Digital literacy, Creative Thinking, Problem-solving, and Time Management. The incorporation of digital quizzes, assignments, and interactive activities using Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools was done in the ARCS-PC Model. The online classroom lectures and activities were conducted using the Microsoft Teams (MS Teams) educational platform. Linear regression is performed to analyze the modified ARCS-PC model. These technology-enabled online classes and ICT tools have helped teach lifelong learning, collaborative learning, a student-centric approach, and better competency skills to effectively engage students in online courses. In our proposed method, an improvement of 11.21 % was observed in the student's performance compared to a maximum of 8.8 % in the existing traditional models. Detailed analysis and quantification of the proposed method are given in the paper.}

In this scenario, new educational technology tools and immersive learning affordances (possibilities), offer unprecedented potential for the design of smart and dynamic learning systems and contexts that can enhance learning processes across varied audiences and educational settings. However, current STEAM education practice lacks attention to equipping all citizens with the necessary skills to use digital technologies in an ethical, critical and creative way. This gap calls for attention in design processes, principles and practices that are attentive to ethical considerations and values-based approaches. On the other hand, in its formulation STEAM as an educational approach is framed in four fundamental pillars: creativity, inclusion, citizenship and emerging technologies, which also put attention on the inclusion of disadvantaged and underrepresented social groups during STEAM education design. Following an apparent need to explore ethical and inclusive design in STEAM education, and inspired in the 4E cognition framework, ethical enactivism and embodied and ecosomaesthetics experience design, here we propose a theoretical framework grounded on systems thinking for the design of smart and dynamic STEAM learning systems and settings. The framework is aimed at STEAM educational psychologists, educational technologists, learning designers and educational practitioners who wish to address the global challenges of 21st century education by means of creative, innovative and inclusive education design.}

These data, which contain a lot of social information and opinions. However, these data are rarely fully analyzed, which is a major obstacle to the intelligent development of the social IoT. In this paper, we propose a sentence similarity analysis model to analyze the similarity in people’s opinions on hot topics in social media and news pages. Most of these data are unstructured or semi-structured sentences, so the accuracy of sentence similarity analysis largely determines the model’s performance. For the purpose of improving accuracy, we propose a novel method of sentence similarity computation to extract the syntactic and semantic information of the semi-structured and unstructured sentences. We mainly consider the subjects, predicates and objects of sentence pairs and use Stanford Parser to classify the dependency relation triples to calculate the syntactic and semantic similarity between two sentences. Finally, we verify the performance of the model with the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC), which consists of 4076 pairs of training sentences and 1725 pairs of test sentences, and most of the data came from the news of social data. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods regarding the correlation coefficient and the mean deviation.}

The paper focuses on a specific type of topological parameter, called non-manifold topology as a novel approach to thinking about designing cellular spaces and voids. The approach is illustrated within the context of additive manufacturing of non-conformal cellular structures. The paper concludes that parametric design thinking that omits a definition of topological relationships risks brittleness and failure in later design stages while a consideration of topology can create enhanced and smarter solutions as it can modify parameters based on an accommodation of the design context.}

The prevalence of this view is the result of long and intense study of nerve impulses in electrophysiology culminating in the introduction of the Hodgkin-Huxley model of the action potential in the 1950s. To this day, this model forms the physiological foundation for a broad area of neuroscientific research. However, the Hodgkin-Huxley model cannot account for non-electrical phenomena that accompany nerve impulse propagation, for which there is nevertheless ample evidence. This raises the question whether the Hodgkin-Huxley model is a complete model of the nerve impulse. Several alternative models have been proposed that do take into account non-electrical aspects of the nerve impulse and emphasize their importance in gaining a more complete understanding of the nature of the nerve impulse. In our opinion, these models deserve more attention in neuroscientific research, since, together with the Hodgkin-Huxley model, they will help in addressing and solving a number of questions in basic and applied neuroscience which thus far have remained outside our grasp. Here we provide a historico-scientific overview of the developments that have led to the current conception of the action potential as an electrical phenomenon, discuss some major objections against this conception, and suggest a number of scientific factors which have likely contributed to the enduring success of the Hodgkin-Huxley model and should be taken into consideration whilst contemplating the formulation of a more extensive and complete conception of the nerve impulse.}

However the model is necessary for creativity support systems to detect or predict the change of user's cognitive state in time and make some adaption to avoid inhibiting creativity of user. In this paper we introduce extension creative idea generation method which has the characteristics of formalization and systematization. The method can be represented by extension rules which provide the precondition to build computational cognitive model of user in creativity support systems. The computational cognitive model of user learning in applying extension creative idea generation method is presented through experiments. The experimental results show how and when the user will develop the application skill of creativity technique and inhibit his creativity.}

A complex system, in that regard, is literally one where multiple interactions occur and emerge among the components; and common to all research into complexity are the systems that have adapting, self-organizing, synchronizing, and reacting elements. As physicist Nigel Goldenfeld put very aptly, “Complexity starts when causality breaks down.” Complexity manifests as varying challenges in fields of different complex systems. The inherent complexity of the related phenomena in the fields is beyond the reductionist outlook of traditional science; thus, complexity requires an understanding that extends across a class of complex problems that have so many intricate and subtle attributes that are much more innovative and novel ways of thinking as well as applicable laws are of critical importance. Evolution, order and complexity reveal the relationship between natural and social worlds, which reflects a modern way of thinking that challenges the dichotomy of natural and social. This study provides a conceptual outline and historical account of complexity and complex systems as well as complex order processes toward modern scientific path from Darwin and onwards concerned with natural, applied and social sciences. In the parlance of complex systems, the modern way of thinking based on the transition from evolutionary dimension can be viewed as a revolutionary pedestal, which is a new paradigm for natural sciences and social sciences so that the foundation for the complex systems' interpretations can be explored by the relevant domains.}

In two identical experiments we investigated whether the feeling of lacking control (vs. control) can also foster creative thinking, which we operationalized as the ability to produce associative and dissociative combinations of either related and unrelated concepts. Participants were asked to think about an incident in their life wherein they felt either to be in control or to lose control of the situation. Immediately afterwards, they had to perform a set of tasks tapping (divergent) creative thinking. In both experiments, we observed higher scores in all creativity tasks for participants who recalled loss-of-control events than for those recalling in-control events. Our findings suggest that compensatory processes, triggered by experiencing lack of control, can promote divergent thinking. We propose an account situated within current models of semantic control.}

Here we review preliminary findings from this nascent subfield, focusing on observational learning and strategic interactions. We present evidence consistent with the existence of three distinct learning systems that may contribute to social cognition: an observational-reward-learning system involved in updating expectations of future reward based on observing rewards obtained by others, an action-observational learning system involved in learning about the action tendencies of others, and a third system engaged when it is necessary to learn about the hidden mental-states or traits of another. These three systems appear to map onto distinct neuroanatomical substrates, and depend on unique computational signals.}

The intervention takes place in two academic years analyzing the practice of integrating coding and visual blocks programming in sciences and arts. The “Computational concepts and computational practices” dimension details a quasi-experimental approach, which showed significant improvement regarding learning programming concepts, logic, and computational practices with an active approach. The “Learning processes and coding in primary education” dimension analyzes the practice of the experimental group through questionnaires and structured observation. In this pedagogical design, students interact and create their own content related to curricular areas with several advantages, such as motivation, fun, commitment, and enthusiasm, showing improvements related to computational thinking and computational practices. Understanding of computational concepts through an active approach, Project Based Learning, usefulness, motivation, and commitment underline the importance and effectiveness of implementing a Visual Programming Language from active methodologies in primary education. Due to the aforementioned benefits and positive results obtained in this research, it is recommended to implement a Visual Programming Language in educational settings in 5th and 6th grade in primary education through a cross-curricular implementation.}

This cohort-sequential study (N = 841) explored the cognitive processes that underlie in elementary school children’s math computational growth who are monolingual (English-only) or English learners with Spanish as a first language. Three language subgroups (proficient ELs [relatively proficient in both English and Spanish vocabulary], less proficient ELs [more proficient in English when compared to Spanish vocabulary] and monolingual [English-only]) children with and without math difficulties (MD) were compared on measures of math computation and cognitive growth. As expected, children with MD identified at wave 1 underperformed children without MD in their rate of growth and their level of computational and working memory (WM) performance in the final testing wave. However, two additional findings occurred. First, executive processing measures (working memory and inhibition) were significantly related to computational growth even when measures of reading, fluid intelligence, STM, naming speed and SES were partialed in the analysis. Second, no statistical advantages in executive processing or computation emerged in favor of EL children relative to monolingual children. Taken together, the results support the notion that (a) growth in math computation is tied to growth in the executive system and (b) EL children relatively proficient in English and Spanish experience no growth advantages in WM or computation compared to monolingual children.}

Each septum has a pore that allows for inter-compartmental and inter-hyphal streaming of cytosol and even organelles. The compartments, however, have special organelles, Woronin bodies, that can plug the pores. When the pores are blocked, no flow of cytoplasm takes place. Inspired by the controllable compartmentalisation within the mycelium of the ascomycetous fungi we designed two-dimensional fungal automata. A fungal automaton is a cellular automaton where communication between neighbouring cells can be blocked on demand. We demonstrate computational universality of the fungal automata by implementing sandpile cellular automata circuits there. We reduce the Monotone Circuit Value Problem to the Fungal Automaton Prediction Problem. We construct families of wires, cross-overs and gates to prove that the fungal automata are P-complete.}

This highlights the familiar local-to-global aspect of border formation (linking of edge elements to form contours) with the much less studied global-to-local aspect (which edge elements form part of the same shape). To address this task we show how to incorporate certain high-level notions of distance and geometric arrangement into a form that can influence image-based edge information. The center of the argument is a reaction—diffusion equation that reveals how (global) aspects of the distance map (that is, shape) can be “read out” locally, suggesting a solution to the border ownership problem. Since the reaction—diffusion equation defines a field, a possible information processing role for the local field potential can be defined. We argue that such fields also underlie the Gestalt notion of closure, especially when it is refined using modern experimental techniques. An important implication of this theoretical argument is that, if true, then network modeling must be extended to include the substrate surrounding spiking neurons, including glia.}

Game theory provides a canonical model of strategic thinking implicit in the notion of equilibrium and common knowledge of rationality. Behavioral evidence shows departures from equilibrium play and suggests different models of strategic thinking based on bounded rationality. We report neural evidence in support of non-equilibrium models of strategic thinking. These models suggest a cognitive-hierarchy theory of brain and behavior, according to which people use different levels of strategic thinking that are associated with specific neural computations.}

In terms of hydrodynamics, the kl−εl−kp−εp−Θ equations are adopted to describe phases turbulence. The simulations of hydrodynamics using various drag models and different modelling parameters are conducted to test their sensitivity. Then for the adsorption process, the recently developed formulations of the c2¯−εc model are adopted to characterize rigorously the turbulent mass diffusion in LSFB. With the proposed model, the velocity field as well as the concentration field can be acquired. Simulated results are compared with the experimental data and a good agreement between them is found.}

abstract = {Mental health disorders pose a significant challenge to society. The Bayesian perspective on the mind offers unique insights and tools that may help address a variety of mental health conditions. Psychopathological dysfunctions are often connected to altered predictive and active inference processes, in which cognitive and physiological pathogenic beliefs shape the clinical condition and its symptoms. However, there is a lack of general empirical models that integrate cognitive beliefs, physiological experience, and symptoms in healthy and clinical populations. In this study, we examined the relationship between altered predictive mechanisms, interoception, and pathological bodily distortions in healty individuals and in individuals suffering from anorexia nervosa (AN). AN patients (N=15) completed a Virtual Reality Full-Body Illusion along with interoceptive tasks twice: at hospital admission during an acute symptomatological phase (Time 1) and after a 12-week outpatient clinical weight-restoring rehabilitative program (Time 2). Results were compared to a healthy control group. Our findings indicated that higher levels of interoceptive metacognitive awareness were associated with a greater embodiment. However, unlike in healthy participants, AN patients' interoceptive metacognition was linked to embodiment even in multisensory mismatching (asynchronous) conditions. In addition, unlike in healthy participants, higher interoceptive metacognition in AN patients was related to prior abnormal bodily distortions during the acute symptomatology phase. Prediction errors in bodily estimates predicted posterior bodily estimate distortions after the illusion, but while this relationship was only significant in the synchronous condition in healthy participants, there was no significant difference between synchronous and asynchronous conditions in AN patients. Despite the success of the rehabilitation program in restoring some dysfunctional patterns in the AN group, prediction errors and posterior estimate distortions were present at hospital discharge. Our findings suggest that individuals with AN prioritize interoceptive metacognitive processes (i.e., confidence in their own perceived sensations rather than their actual perceptions), disregarding bottom-up bodily inputs in favour of their prior altered top-down beliefs. Moreover, even if the rehabilitative program partially mitigated these alterations, the pathological condition impaired the patients' ability to coherently update their prior erroneous expectations with real-time multisensory bottom-up bodily information, possibly locking the patients in the experience of a distorted prior top-down belief. These results suggest new therapeutic perspectives and introduce the framework of regenerative virtual therapy (RVT), which aims at utilizing technology-based somatic modification techniques to restructure the maladaptive priors underlying a pathological condition.}

Research shows that, although people do respond with moral outrage to taboo trade-offs, they often acquiesce when secular violations of sacred values are rhetorically reframed as routine or tragic trade-offs. The results reveal the peculiar character of moral boundaries on what is thinkable, alternately punitively rigid and forgivingly flexible.}

We find consistent difficulties in tasks entailing complex decision making and set shifting, but limited evidence in other areas that are altered in adult OCD, such as habit and confidence formation. Based on these findings, we establish a neurocomputational framework that illustrates how cognition can go awry and lead to symptoms of juvenile OCD. We link these possible aberrant neural processes to neuroimaging findings in juvenile OCD and show that juvenile OCD is mainly characterised by disruptions of complex reasoning systems.}

This strategy enables us to carry out these computations with millions of coupled, nonlinear equations, and thus resolve the flow features in great detail. At Reynolds number 300 and 800, our results indicate strong 3D features arising from the instability of the columnar vortices forming the Karman street.

To accommodate the scale of implementation required, there is a need to increase the efficiency of current design and production processes. Computational methodologies have proven to increase design efficiency by generating and parsing through myriad design options based on multivariate (e.g., spatial, environmental, and economic) factors. Modular Construction (MC) is another approach used to increase efficiency of both design and production. This paper combines these approaches in a novel methodology for generating modular design options for extensions of existing buildings (an efficacious form of building adaptation). The methodology focuses on key architectural design metrics such as energy use, daylighting, life cycle impact, life cycle costing and structural complexity, whereby a set of Pareto-optimal exploratory design options are generated for evaluation and further design development. A functional demonstration is then carried out for the extension of Ken Soble Tower in Hamilton, Ontario. The contribution of this research is the efficient development and evaluation of design options for improving existing residential infrastructure in order to meet required energy improvements using modular extensions.}

First, it describes the tensions arising from the convergence of different disciplinary traditions in the emergence of this new area of study and, second, it shows how these tensions are dealt with through the articulation of distinctive practices of knowledge production and transmission. To achieve this goal, three major instances of knowledge transfer dynamics in agent-based computational social science are analysed. The first instance is the emergence of the research field. Relations of knowledge transfer and cross-fertilisation between agent-based computational social science and wider and more established disciplinary areas: complexity science, computational science and social science, are discussed. The second instance is the approach to scientific modelling in the field. It is shown how the practice of agent-based modelling is affected by the conflicting coexistence of shared methodological commitments transferred from both empirical and formal disciplines. Lastly, the third instance pertains internal practices of knowledge production and transmission. Through the discussion of these practices, the tensions arising from converging dissimilar disciplinary traditions in agent-based computational social science are highlighted.}

This chapter describes the contribution of complexity science to understanding of the climate system and the unique challenges its complex properties pose to climate predictions and policy analysis. First, it presents a brief exploration of the Earth's climate system through the lens of complexity science. Then, it introduces the data sources and modeling strategies that climate science uses to understand past behavior, to fingerprint causes of current climate changes, and to project future climate. The complex dynamics of the climate system constrain ability to gain knowledge about the climate system and add uncertainty to predictions of the impacts of human-induced climate change. It also investigates six case studies that illustrate the importance and development of key complexity themes in climate science: glacial-interglacial cycles, thermohaline ocean circulation, ice sheets, vegetation cover changes, extinction, and overshoot scenarios. In addition, it investigates the implications of the complexity of the Earth system for climate policy analysis. Assessments of the impacts of climate change are often disciplinary-based and not sufficiently integrative across important disciplinary subcomponents, producing misleading results that have potentially dangerous environmental consequences. The current framework of cost-benefit optimization is particularly flawed. Further, it describes how one should restructure climate policy analysis as an integrated assessment process, combining data and relationships from the physical, biological and social sciences, that includes robust assessments of potential risks within a vulnerability framework.}

The organization, its structure and motivational culture have to change first. In short, traditional hierarchy of command, based on extreme specialization and little autonomy of employees and their departments will not be as open to the multiplicity of criteria as the self-managing teams of non-hierarchical companies which integrate task, labor and knowledge and which are only now starting to dominate certain business and management cultures.}

However, there are barriers that need to be considered and understood to be able to optimise the potential of these systems to support a more sustainable future. To this end, transdisciplinary skills and a combination of different mindsets are needed to be able to ask the right questions at the right time. There are several approaches that can help us to initiate constructing innovative, transformative, future-oriented and systematic ideas and questions.

abstract = {In the study and treatment of psychosis, emotional intelligence (EI) and thinking styles are important patient characteristics for successful outcomes in clinical intervention. Anticipation of unpredictable stimuli (AUS) may be understood as an anomalous perception and anomalous cognition in which an individual supposedly senses and recognizes future stimuli in an unexpected way, also referred to as “hunches or premonitions.” This examined the roles of EI and thinking styles in AUSs in convenience samples of healthy participants (n = 237) versus patients diagnosed with psychosis (n = 118). We adjusted several quadratic and exponential regression models according to the obtained functions. Group means were also compared to examine differences in EI scores for participants with psychosis compared to healthy participants. In the healthy group, EI predicted AUSs with a weight between 42% and 58%. Thinking styles were not correlated with AUSs. However, EI was not correlated with AUSs in the clinical group. Patients with psychosis tended to score higher on AUSs and lower on EI and thinking styles compared to participants in the healthy group. We discuss EI as a variable that can contextualize some anomalous perceptions which are otherwise difficult to classify or measure within the classic psychosis continuum model.}

The work we review illustrates the progress and promise that population-level thinking holds for cognitive neuroscience—for delivering new insight into attention, working memory, decision-making, executive function, learning, and reward processing.}

However, little study has focused on the designer's search strategies in dealing with well-structured design subproblems. The research method adopted is protocol analysis. The results suggest that an obvious difference between experts and novices is their problem-decomposing strategies.

Results also showed that multiple representations and/or visualizations of mathematical concepts, ideas, and problems can be employed as an effective psychometric tool that measure pre-service teachers’ creative thinking abilities in mathematics. One implication is that instructors can provide more multiple representations and/or visualizations of mathematical concepts during instruction so that pre-service teachers can find opportunities to develop their creative thinking in mathematics.

abstract = {We propose an explanatory and computational theory of transformative discoveries in science. The theory is derived from a recurring theme found in a diverse range of scientific change, scientific discovery, and knowledge diffusion theories in philosophy of science, sociology of science, social network analysis, and information science. The theory extends the concept of structural holes from social networks to a broader range of associative networks found in science studies, especially including networks that reflect underlying intellectual structures such as co-citation networks and collaboration networks. The central premise is that connecting otherwise disparate patches of knowledge is a valuable mechanism of creative thinking in general and transformative scientific discovery in particular. In addition, the premise consistently explains the value of connecting people from different disciplinary specialties. The theory not only explains the nature of transformative discoveries in terms of the brokerage mechanism but also characterizes the subsequent diffusion process as optimal information foraging in a problem space. Complementary to epidemiological models of diffusion, foraging-based conceptualizations offer a unified framework for arriving at insightful discoveries and optimizing subsequent pathways of search in a problem space. Structural and temporal properties of potentially high-impact scientific discoveries are derived from the theory to characterize the emergence and evolution of intellectual networks of a field. Two Nobel Prize winning discoveries, the discovery of Helicobacter pylori and gene targeting techniques, and a discovery in string theory demonstrated such properties. Connections to and differences from existing approaches are discussed. The primary value of the theory is that it provides not only a computational model of intellectual growth, but also concrete and constructive explanations of where one may find insightful inspirations for transformative scientific discoveries.}

Disorganization, presenting as impairment in thought, language and goal-directed behavior, is a core multidimensional syndrome of psychotic disorders. This study examined whether scalable computational measures of spoken language, and smartphone usage pattern, could serve as digital biomarkers of clinical disorganization symptoms.
Methods
We examined in a longitudinal cohort of adults with a psychotic disorder, the associations between clinical measures of disorganization and computational measures of 1) spoken language derived from monthly, semi-structured, recorded clinical interviews; and 2) smartphone usage pattern derived via passive sensing technologies over the month prior to the interview. The language features included speech quantity, rate, fluency, and semantic regularity. The smartphone features included data missingness and phone usage during sleep time. The clinical measures consisted of the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) conceptual disorganization, difficulty in abstract thinking, and poor attention, items. Mixed linear regression analyses were used to estimate both fixed and random effects.
Results
Greater severity of clinical symptoms of conceptual disorganization was associated with greater verbosity and more disfluent speech. Greater severity of conceptual disorganization was also associated with greater missingness of smartphone data, and greater smartphone usage during sleep time. While the observed associations were significant across the group, there was also significant variation between individuals.
Conclusions
The findings suggest that digital measures of speech disfluency may serve as scalable markers of conceptual disorganization. The findings warrant further investigation into the use of recorded interviews and passive sensing technologies to assist in the characterization and tracking of psychotic illness.}

The results were obtained from anonymous questionnaires completed by 221 course participants and their parents. The answers confirm that this type of course becomes a new fascinating manner of spending spare time by children. Moreover, quantitative analysis of student’s finals projects also has been performed. In the process of creative programming in the game-based environment, children develop the computational thinking skills, problem-solving strategies, and abstract thinking. Moreover, children are supported by their parents, who notice how important these competences are and how great opportunities they will present for children in future. Authors continue to grow Scratch programming course to democratize access to new technologies and education, preparing future generation for a world in which computational and algorithmic thinking is a central part of problem-solving. Perhaps some of the course participants will continue their study of programming and make it a career for their life.}

The students' activities of designing, composing, and testing solutions were recorded by log data for later analysis. To initially unveil the students' practice and strategies exhibited in the visual problem-solving environment, this study proposed several indicators to quantitatively represent students' computational practice (Sequence, Selection, Simple iteration, Nested iteration, and Testing), computational design (Problem decomposition, Abutment composition, and Nesting composition), and computational performance (Goal attainment and Program size). By the method of cluster analysis, some empirical patterns regarding the students' programming learning with computational problem-solving were identified. Furthermore, comparisons of computational design and computational performance among the different patterns of computational practice were conducted. Considering the relations of students' computational practice to computational design and performance, evidence-based suggestions on the design of supportive programming environments for novice programmers are discussed.}

We present four key findings based on school visits, interviews, an electronical survey, two questionnaires, and workshops including theme discussions: (1) teachers did not perceive Technology Comprehension as a distinct subject, but rather as a set of skills that can be integrated into other subjects; (2) teachers pointed out that Technology Comprehension opens up for interdisciplinary and engaging learning activities, but they need more scaffolding and support; (3) Technology Comprehension challenges teachers’ existing competencies and there is a need for a framework that takes into account computing, design, and societal reflection as a whole; (4) Technology Comprehension appealed to various kind of students, not only those who are enthusiastic about technical matters. This study contributes to the previous research on making and digital fabrication by addressing how these endeavours are implemented on a national level through engaging with local teachers.

Fourteen participants were given a task requiring them to interpret data relative to plausible and implausible causal theories. Encountering covariation-based data during the evaluation of a plausible theory as opposed to an implausible theory selectively recruited neural tissue in the prefrontal and occipital cortices. In addition, the plausibility of a causal theory modulated the recruitment of distinct neural tissue depending on the extent to which the data were consistent versus inconsistent with the theory provided. Specifically, evaluation of data consistent with a plausible causal theory recruited neural tissue in the parahippocampal gyrus, whereas evaluating data inconsistent with a plausible theory recruited neural tissue in the anterior cingulate, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and precuneus. We suggest that these findings provide a neural instantiation of the mechanisms by which working hypotheses and evidence are integrated in the brain.}

However, the conventional model of biology seems to mistake cause and effect. According to the reductionist view, the causal chain in biology is chemicals → code → cognition. Despite this prevailing view, there are no examples in the literature to show that the laws of physics and chemistry can produce codes, or that codes produce cognition. Chemicals are just the physical layer of any information system. In contrast, although examples of cognition generating codes and codes controlling chemicals are ubiquitous in biology and technology, cognition remains a mystery. Thus, the central question in biology is: What is the nature and origin of cognition? In order to elucidate this pivotal question, we must cultivate a deeper understanding of information flows. Through this lens, we see that biological cognition is volitional (i.e., deliberate, intentional, or knowing), and while technology is constrained by deductive logic, living things make choices and generate novel information using inductive logic. Information has been called “the hard problem of life’ and cannot be fully explained by known physical principles (Walker et al., 2017). The present paper uses information theory (the mathematical foundation of our digital age) and Turing machines (computers) to highlight inaccuracies in prevailing reductionist models of biology, and proposes that the correct causation sequence is cognition → code → chemicals.}

The model takes its inspiration from amalgams as applied in case-based reasoning, but lifts them into category theory so as to follow Joseph Goguen’s intuition for a mathematically precise characterisation of conceptual blending at a representation-independent level of abstraction. We prove that our amalgam-based category-theoretical model of conceptual blending is essentially equivalent to the pushout model in the ordered category of partial maps as put forward by Goguen. But unlike Goguen’s approach, our model is more suitable to capture computational realisations of conceptual blending, and we exemplify this by concretising our model to computational conceptual blends for various representation formalisms and application domains.}

abstract = {Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to understand the perspectives, mental states and beliefs of others in order to anticipate their behaviour and is therefore crucial to social interactions. Although fMRI has been widely used to establish the neural networks implicated in ToM, little is known about the timing of ToM-related brain activity. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure the neural processes underlying ToM, as MEG provides very accurate timing and excellent spatial localization of brain processes. We recorded MEG activity during a false belief task, a reliable measure of ToM, in twenty young adults (10 females). MEG data were recorded in a 151 sensor CTF system (MISL, Coquitlam, BC) and data were co-registered to each participant's MRI (Siemens 3T) for source reconstruction. We found stronger right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) activations in the false belief condition from 150ms to 225ms, in the right precuneus from 275ms to 375ms, in the right inferior frontal gyrus from 200ms to 300ms and the superior frontal gyrus from 300ms to 400ms. Our findings extend the literature by demonstrating the timing and duration of neural activity in the main regions involved in the “mentalizing” network, showing that activations related to false belief in adults are predominantly right lateralized and onset around 100ms. The sensitivity of MEG will allow us to determine spatial and temporal differences in the brain processes in ToM in younger populations or those who demonstrate deficits in this ability.}

abstract = {Gestures that spontaneously accompany speech convey information coordinated with the concurrent speech. There has been considerable theoretical disagreement about the process by which this informational coordination is achieved. Some theories predict that the information encoded in gesture is not influenced by how information is verbally expressed. However, others predict that gestures encode only what is encoded in speech. This paper investigates this issue by comparing informational coordination between speech and gesture across different languages. Narratives in Turkish, Japanese, and English were elicited using an animated cartoon as the stimulus. It was found that gestures used to express the same motion events were influenced simultaneously by (1) how features of motion events were expressed in each language, and (2) spatial information in the stimulus that was never verbalized. From this, it is concluded that gestures are generated from spatio-motoric processes that interact on-line with the speech production process. Through the interaction, spatio-motoric information to be expressed is packaged into chunks that are verbalizable within a processing unit for speech formulation. In addition, we propose a model of speech and gesture production as one of a class of frameworks that are compatible with the data.}

abstract = {In cognitive science, image schemas are identified as fundamental patterns of cognition. They are schematic prelinguistic conceptualisations of events and serve as conceptual building blocks for concepts. This paper proposes that image schemas can play an important role in computational concept invention, namely within the computational realisation of conceptual blending. We propose to build a library of formalised image schemas, and illustrate how they can guide the search for a base space in the concept invention work flow. Their schematic nature is captured by the idea of organising image schemas into families. Formally, they are represented as heterogeneous, interlinked theories.}

abstract = {This chapter focuses on force models governing spherical particle motion which are used in Euler–Lagrange methods. These forces also represent a momentum exchange and are important for modeling how fluid dynamics change in the presence of particles. A survey of widely used drag and lift correlations for single- and multiple-particle systems will be presented along with some physical discussion as to their origins. Our focus is on incompressible applications though a few compressible force formulations will be mentioned. A central quantity that arises in these force correlations is the notion of the undisturbed fluid velocity. Seldom taught in fluid mechanics curricula and often confused with “free-stream” velocity, the undisturbed fluid velocity is discussed in detail to develop the reader's intuition. Modeling of the undisturbed fluid velocity is addressed in the context of two-way coupled correction schemes.}
