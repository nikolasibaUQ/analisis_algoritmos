abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has forced a comprehensive vaccination program that spans across social, geographical, and political boundaries. Our study aims to evaluate the program's effectiveness and explore the social factors that can influence its success globally. By analyzing data on immunization coverage and COVID-19 vaccination status for 196 and 187 countries, respectively, and taking into account the cultural values of 110 countries, we identified a correlation between vaccination success and societal openness to change. Our findings suggest that a history of good immunization coverage alone may not guarantee successful vaccine rollout; an optimistic ecosystem is also necessary. People must be willing to accept and apply the solution, and the rollout must address their psychological need for 360-degree success. Our study thus highlights the importance of understanding the social outlook to calibrate the attainment scale of global vaccination programs.}

Examples of these problems are the high computational complexity of many story generation algorithms, the difficulties associated with the generation of interactive narratives that are compelling and emotionally impactful, the complex interactions among characters, and the need for tools and methods to support story writers in the process of creating and managing the narrative structure of interactive stories. In this work, we present and evaluate a new approach to generate and manage the plot structure of character-based interactive narratives in games, which combines multi-agent planning with a drama management strategy based on narrative structures. The proposed method is supported by an authoring tool that allows authors to create and test interactive narratives using graphical interfaces and intuitive diagrams. The results of our study suggest the effectiveness of our approach in generating interactive narratives for highly interactive game environments. In addition, a user study of the proposed authoring tool indicates that it can successfully support the development of character-based interactive narratives without requiring programming knowledge.}

Although AI-aided material design holds great promise for some applications, whether it has surpassed human creativity remains uncertain. The aim of the current study was to compare the divergent exploration capacity of AI with that of humans on a material design task. Human participants were asked to find a high-performance lubricant molecule under searching conditions comparable to a state-of-the-art AI system. Results indicated that, on average, AI was able to find significantly better lubricant molecules. However, the best molecule found by AI fell short of the best molecule found by a human participant. Furthermore, the structural characteristics of the molecules found by AI and human participants differed significantly. These findings suggest that a state-of-the-art AI system is capable of surpassing human divergent exploration capacity in material design, as in other fields in which AI has advanced. Nevertheless, our results also demonstrate that human intelligence and AI can play complementary roles in covering a broader search space. This investigation opens up new possibilities for collaborative systems involving both AI agents and humans in material design.}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter reviews methodological issues involved in the structural approach used in feature logic. A direct consequence of the systematic approach to a variety of feature logics is that it clarifies the relationships between them. This is most explicit in the presentation of translations between various existing and putative feature logics which draws heavily on the correspondence theory that relates modal and classical languages. The chapter describes a general approach to the subject called the structural approach, and explains that thinking in structural terms is a useful way of thinking about unification formalisms and their interrelationships. At present, in contemporary unification-based linguistic frameworks, linguistic data is modelled by certain kinds of decorated labelled (directed) graphs. Perhaps the most prevalent way of thinking about unification-based grammar formalisms is that they are languages for expressing constraints on feature structures. Two basic ideas drive modal logic: one syntactic, and the other semantic. Modal languages are interpreted on Kripke models, which are set theoretic entities providing the following information. Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL) is an extension of modal logic; PDL and some of its extensions are natural constraint languages for dealing with feature structures. Subsequently, Attribute Value Matrices (AVMs) are one of the most widely used methods of describing feature structures. A general setting for feature logic is the space of relational structures of model theory, together with the various languages for describing these structures, and the satisfiability preserving translations that exist among these languages. The basic ideas are very simple: feature structures are certain sorts of relational structures, and while there is a vast range of languages for talking about these structures, these languages are interrelated by satisfiability preserving translations.}

The reflectivity and the refractive index have been observed to have a static value of 0.36 and 4.03, respectively.

abstract = {With the acceleration of the upgrading of the automobile consumption market, artificial intelligence has become an increasingly effective means of enhancing the creative design of automobile appearance modeling. However, when artificial intelligence processes specific design tasks, creativity is primarily based on data drive, resulting in machine-generated design schemes that do not match human-specific psychological intentions. Due to the absence of design knowledge in the process of machine design, there is a data gap between human cognitive thought and machine information processing. This paper aims to structure the human's complex cognitive knowledge of car frontal form, establish the consistency between human and machine cognitive structures, and reduce communication barriers in the process of human‚Äìmachine hybrid creative design. To achieve this objective, a human‚Äìmachine hybrid intelligence methodology ‚Äì a combination of human cognitive mental model, human‚Äìmachine shared knowledge base, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) ‚Äì was developed to generate a large number of car frontal forms that are consistent with the design intent. First, we constructeda mental model of human cognition based on three dimensions: design intent, drawing behavior, and functional structure. Second, we created a shared human‚Äìmachine knowledge base with design Knowledge. This knowledge base contains 12,560 images of car frontal form designs with corresponding morphological semantic labels and 3,140 sketches of car frontal forms drawn by hand. Human‚Äìmachine shared knowledge base datawasutilized in a machine learning training network. In addition, a conditional cross-domain generative adversarial network was developed to investigate the implicit relationship between sketch characteristics, morphological semantics, and image visual effects. Using the suggested method, a large number of images with the specified morphological semantic category and resembling the hand-drawn sketch of a car frontal form can be generated rapidly. In terms of the quality of car frontal form generation, our research is superior to the baseline model according to qualitative and quantitative assessments. In comparison to the designer's output, the human‚Äìmachine hybrid intelligent generation also demonstrates excellent creative performance.}

The mammalian hippocampal formation contains several distinct populations of neurons involved in representing self-position and orientation. These neurons, which include place, grid, head direction, and boundary cells, are thought to collectively instantiate cognitive maps supporting flexible navigation. However, to flexibly navigate, it is necessary to also maintain internal representations of goal locations, such that goal-directed routes can be planned and executed. Although it has remained unclear how the mammalian brain represents goal locations, multiple neural candidates have recently been uncovered during different phases of navigation. For example, during planning, sequential activation of spatial cells may enable simulation of future routes toward the goal. During travel, modulation of spatial cells by the prospective route, or by distance and direction to the goal, may allow maintenance of route and goal-location information, supporting navigation on an ongoing basis. As the goal is approached, an increased activation of spatial cells may enable the goal location to become distinctly represented within cognitive maps, aiding goal localization. Lastly, after arrival at the goal, sequential activation of spatial cells may represent the just-taken route, enabling route learning and evaluation. Here, we review and synthesize these and other evidence for goal coding in mammalian brains, relate the experimental findings to predictions from computational models, and discuss outstanding questions and future challenges.}

An analytical model is proposed to capture the excitation from tooth profile modifications at the sun‚Äìplanet and ring‚Äìplanet meshes. The accuracy of the proposed model for dynamic analysis is correlated against a benchmark finite element analysis. Perturbation analysis yields a closed-form approximation of the vibration response with tooth profile modifications. The perturbation solution is used to investigate the effects of tooth profile modification. The tooth profile modification parameters that minimize response are readily obtained. Static transmission error and dynamic response are minimized at different amounts of profile modification, which contradicts common practical thinking regarding the correlation between static transmission error and dynamic response. Contrary to expectations, the optimal sun‚Äìplanet and ring‚Äìplanet tooth profile modifications that minimize response when applied individually may increase dynamic response when applied simultaneously. System parameters such as mesh stiffness and mesh phase significantly affect the influence of tooth profile modification.}

This is a strategic priority of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), public policies and global initiatives. The operability and functionality of critical infrastructure are continuously challenged by multiple stressors, increasing demands and ageing, whilst their interconnectedness and dependencies pose additional challenges. Emerging and disruptive digital technologies have the potential to enhance climate resilience of critical infrastructure, by providing rapid and accurate assessment of asset condition and support decision-making and adaptation. In this pursuit, it is imperative to adopt multidisciplinary roadmaps and deploy computational, communication and other digital technologies, tools and monitoring systems. Nevertheless, the potential of these emerging technologies remains largely unexploited, as there is a lack of consensus, integrated approaches and legislation in support of their use. In this perspective paper, we discuss the main challenges and enablers of climate-resilient infrastructure and we identify how available roadmaps, tools and emerging digital technologies, e.g. Internet of Things, digital twins, point clouds, Artificial Intelligence, Building Information Modelling, can be placed at the service of a safer world. We show how digital technologies will lead to infrastructure of enhanced resilience, by delivering efficient and reliable decision-making, in a proactive and/or reactive manner, prior, during and after hazard occurrences. In this respect, we discuss how emerging technologies significantly reduce the uncertainties in all phases of infrastructure resilience evaluations. Thus, building climate-resilient infrastructure, aided by digital technologies, will underpin critical activities globally, contribute to Net Zero target and hence safeguard our societies and economies. To achieve this we set an agenda, which is aligned with the relevant SDGs and highlights the urgent need to deliver holistic and inclusive standards and legislation, supported by coordinated alliances, to fully utilise emerging digital technologies.}

This paper proposed an efficient approximation scheme for hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function which purely based on combinational design architecture. The approximation is based on mathematical analysis by considering maximum allowable error in a neural network. The results prove that the proposed combinational design of an AF is efficient in terms of area, power and delay with negligible accuracy loss on MNIST and CIFAR-10 benchmark datasets.

Neurosurgically implanted stimulators appear to achieve better results on a larger number of patients, but noninvasive stimulation has clear advantages in terms of safety and cost. Mixed results can be chalked up to individual anatomical and connectomic variations: the cortex is by far more complex than other neural, deeper targets, and current computational modeling efforts are underway to improve results. The next generation of CS will come with closed-loop capability and newer electrodes, in addition to refinements in personalized neuroimaging-guided targeting.}

These devices, coated with anti-proliferative drugs, are deployed into stenosed or occluded vessels, compressing the plaque to restore natural blood flow, whilst simultaneously combating the evolution of restenotic tissue. Since the development of the first stent, extensive research has investigated how further advancements in stent technology can improve patient outcome. Mathematical and computational modelling has featured heavily, with models focussing on structural mechanics, computational fluid dynamics, drug elution kinetics and subsequent binding within the arterial wall; often considered separately. Smooth Muscle Cell (SMC) proliferation and neointimal growth are key features of the healing process following stent deployment. However, models which depict the action of drug on these processes are lacking. In this article, we start by reviewing current models of cell growth, which predominantly emanate from cancer research, and available published data on SMC proliferation, before presenting a series of mathematical models of varying complexity to detail the action of drug on SMC growth in vitro. Our results highlight that, at least for Sodium Salicylate and Paclitaxel, the current state-of-the-art nonlinear saturable binding model is incapable of capturing the proliferative response of SMCs across a range of drug doses and exposure times. Our findings potentially have important implications on the interpretation of current computational models and their future use to optimise and control drug release from DES and drug-coated balloons.}

While statistical models can credibly rely on assumptions about the relationship between variables in the short-term, they are frequently less reliable in the long-term as political and technological transformations profoundly change how the economy works over time. Towards improving long-term predictions for energy commodities, this paper uses the elicitation and aggregation of experts' beliefs to put forward forecasts for crude oil and natural gas prices by incentivizing experts to tell the truth and minimising their own biases through the application of the Bayesian Truth Serum.

In our efforts to address the Big Data challenges of climate science, we are moving toward a notion of Climate Analytics-as-a-Service (CAaaS). We focus on analytics, because it is the knowledge gained from our interactions with Big Data that ultimately produce societal benefits. We focus on CAaaS because we believe it provides a useful way of thinking about the problem: a specialization of the concept of business process-as-a-service, which is an evolving extension of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS enabled by Cloud Computing. Within this framework, Cloud Computing plays an important role; however, we see it as only one element in a constellation of capabilities that are essential to delivering climate analytics as a service. These elements are essential because in the aggregate they lead to generativity, a capacity for self-assembly that we feel is the key to solving many of the Big Data challenges in this domain.

The MERRA reanalysis integrates observational data with numerical models to produce a global temporally and spatially consistent synthesis of 26 key climate variables. It represents a type of data product that is of growing importance to scientists doing climate change research and a wide range of decision support applications. MERRA/AS brings together the following generative elements in a full, end-to-end demonstration of CAaaS capabilities: (1) high-performance, data proximal analytics, (2) scalable data management, (3) software appliance virtualization, (4) adaptive analytics, and (5) a domain-harmonized API. The effectiveness of MERRA/AS has been demonstrated in several applications. In our experience, Cloud Computing lowers the barriers and risk to organizational change, fosters innovation and experimentation, facilitates technology transfer, and provides the agility required to meet our customers‚Äô increasing and changing needs. Cloud Computing is providing a new tier in the data services stack that helps connect earthbound, enterprise-level data and computational resources to new customers and new mobility-driven applications and modes of work. For climate science, Cloud Computing‚Äôs capacity to engage communities in the construction of new capabilities is perhaps the most important link between Cloud Computing and Big Data.}

abstract = {A computational model of emotion must explain both the rapid dynamics of some emotional reactions as well as the slower responses that follow deliberation. This is often addressed by positing multiple levels of appraisal processes such as fast pattern directed vs. slower deliberative appraisals. In our view, this confuses appraisal with inference. Rather, we argue for a single and automatic appraisal process that operates over a person‚Äôs interpretation of their relationship to the environment. Dynamics arise from perceptual and inferential processes operating on this interpretation (including deliberative and reactive processes). This article discusses current developments in a computational model of emotion processes and illustrates how a single-level model of appraisal obviates a multi-level approach within the context of modeling a naturalistic emotional situation.}

Transition metal-catalyzed C‚ÄìH functionalization has recently emerged as a powerful synthetic tool for accessing various value-added structural motifs. However, addressing the remote C‚ÄìH activation including Œ≥-C(sp3)‚ÄìH and meta-C(sp2)‚ÄìH versions is far less investigated and more challenging than that of ortho-C(sp2)‚ÄìH activation. By fine-tuning the characteristics of the C‚Äìosmium (Os) œÉ bond in situ generated by the phenylpyridine scaffold-mediated ortho-C‚ÄìH activation/C,N-bidentate coordination, either Os(II)-catalyzed intramolecular Œ≥-C(sp3)‚ÄìH amidation or intermolecular meta-C(sp2)‚ÄìH alkylation has been realized in a highly efficient and chemo-/site-/region-selective manner. Through integrated experimental and computational mechanistic studies, the principle of the observed selectivity and two distinct reaction pathways, involving the Os(IV)-nitrenoid-mediated Os(II)-Os(IV)-Os(II) catalytic cycle and the Os(III)-radical-enabled Os(II)-Os(III)-Os(II) SET process, respectively, have been also clarified. Taken together, it provides an insightful reference benchmark for the future development of more wonderful C‚ÄìH functionalizations mediated by transition metals, especially by less-explored Os.}

The challenge is to explain the capacity of so-called informationally unencapsulated cognitive processes to deal effectively with information from potentially any cognitive domain without the burden of having to explicitly sift the relevant from the irrelevant. The paper advocates a global workspace architecture, with its ability to manage massively parallel resources in the context of a serial thread of computation, as an answer to this challenge. Analogical reasoning is given particular attention, since it exemplifies informational unencapsulation in its most extreme form. Because global workspace theory also purports to account for the distinction between conscious and unconscious information processing, the paper advances the tentative conclusion that consciousness may go hand-in-hand with a solution to the frame problem in the biological brain.}

Within cement production, the calcination at middle and high-temperature values (from 120¬†¬∞C to 400¬†¬∞C depending on the process parameters) of the raw material requires such a process fan, which also ensures the draft and feed of the flue gases and combustion air needed for the operation of the main equipment of the cement factory. To detect and analyze the impact conditions within the heavy-duty fan, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses were performed. The analysis of the numerical results shows that the relevant fan surfaces are affected by different impact velocities and angles, generating non-uniform erosion patterns similar to the on-field detections. Besides, the obtained comprehensive description of the flow and contaminants behaviors through the entire flow path enables setting up the subsequent experimental investigation. The erosive wear behavior of a Fe-Cr-C hardfacing cast iron and wear-resistant steel was tested through a test rig constructed for the purpose of being in accordance with the ASTM G76 standard. The test bench was adapted to manage the raw meal powder used in the cement factory to reproduce the actual operating conditions. The results show a greater capability of Fe-Cr-C hardfacing cast iron to face the erosion phenomenon in terms of lower values of material loss over the exposure time. These findings, coupled with the metallographic analysis to detect the erosion mechanisms (ductile and/or brittle), help a better prediction of the fan operating life. The investigation showed the reliability of the numerical/experimental coupled approach in assessing the actual erosion magnitude and the influence of the impact angle on the erosion phenomena. This coupled approach gains a further understanding of the proper design of manufacturing and maintenance activities, covering several project steps from material selections to the scheduled and overhaul operations. A reliable operating-life prediction allows manufacturers and operators to obtain production and economic goals.}

However, as technology continues to advance rapidly, STEM education has experienced a rapid transformation with seamless integration of various technologies. Students in the K-12 education is required to keep up with the growing innovation and to bridge this gap, pedagogical approaches play a crucial role. Therefore, this review presents the current landscape, developmental trends, and future directions of the various pedagogical practices used to integrate innovation in K-12 STEM. The characteristics and environmental perceptions that influence the development of innovation in students using such approaches are examined. Results from 42 systematically shortlisted studies indicate positive correlations of personalized pedagogical approaches in promoting innovation in students, thereby increasing STEM literacy in K-12 education. However, limitations that remain with teacher competencies and school facilities to cope with various pedagogical approaches are also discussed. Finally, we conclude with our recommendations on effective and efficient approaches that can be implemented in K-12 STEM education to develop the skills and mindset in students necessary to become innovative thinkers and prepare them for a technology-driven society.}

abstract = {Objective
We used topology optimization technology to explore the new theory and method of interbody fusion cage design and realized an innovative design of interbody cages.
Methods
The lumbar spine of a normal healthy volunteer was scanned to perform reverse modeling. Based on the scan data for the L1-L2 segments of the lumbar spine, a three dimensional model was reconstructed to obtain the complete simulation model of the L1-L2 segment. The boundary inversion method was used to obtain approximately isotropic material parameters that can effectively characterize the mechanical behavior of vertebrae, thereby reducing the computational complexity. The topology description function was used to model the clinically used traditional fusion cage to obtain Cage A. The moving morphable void-based topology optimization method was used for the integrated design of size, shape, and topology to obtain the optimized fusion cage, Cage B.
Results
The volume fraction of the bone graft window in Cage B was 74.02%, which was 60.67% higher than that (46.07%) in Cage A. Additionally, the structural strain energy in the design domain of Cage B was 1.48¬†mJ, which was lower than that of Cage A (satisfying the constraints). The maximum stress in the design domain of Cage B was 5.336 Mpa, which was 35.6% lower than that (8.286 Mpa) of Cage A. In addition, the surface stress distribution of Cage B was more uniform than that of Cage A.
Conclusions
This study proposed a new innovative design method for interbody fusion cages, which not only provides new insights into the innovative design of interbody fusion cages but may also guide the customized design of interbody fusion cages in different pathological environments.}

Due to their ability in generation of flow patterns throughout the basin, they can be used not only as an advanced method for flood mapping studies and hazard assessment but also as an innovative tool for the analysis of river drainage networks, opening new perspectives for several environmental processes. In particular, in this work we put the river networks in a 2D-SWEs framework, meaning that the traditional tree-like fluvial structure, represented by a skeleton composed of a set of lines, is replaced by a collection of points discretizing the 2-D geometry of the river structure itself, for which the values of the hydrodynamic values are provided by the numerical simulations. This approach is used here to derive a new scaling property that relates the specific discharge threshold, used to identify the river network cells, to the total areas of the network cells themselves. The hydrodynamic and geomorphological interpretation of this power law function and the influence of grid resolution, on some relevant parameters of this curve, have inspired the development of a heuristic procedure for non-uniform grid generation, able to detect the most hydrodynamically active areas of the basins for which the grid refinement process makes sense. Moreover, information related to how much grid refinement is needed is provided as well. The performances of this procedure are very promising in terms of accuracy of simulated discharges, hydrodynamic behaviour of the river network and flooded areas, reducing significantly the computational times in respect to the use of fine uniform grids.}

In particular it is proven that l-regularity in XLCNF implies k-uniformity, i.e. all clauses have the same number k of literals. Allowed k- values obey k (k‚àí1)=0 (mod l), and the number of clauses m is given by m =kl-(k‚àí1). Then the computational complexity of monotone l-regular XLCNF formulas with respect to exact satisfiability (XSAT) is determined.

abstract = {Identification of appropriate clean technologies for industrial implementation requires systematic evaluation based on a set of criteria that normally reflect economic, technical, environmental and other aspects. Such multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) problems involve rating a finite set of alternatives with respect to multiple potentially conflicting criteria. Conventional MADM approaches often involve explicit trade-offs in between criteria based on the expert's or decision maker's priorities. In practice, many experts arrive at decisions based on their tacit knowledge. This paper presents a new induction approach, wherein the implicit preference rules that estimate the expert's thinking pathways can be induced. P-graph framework is applied to the induction approach as it adds the advantage of being able to determine both optimal and near-optimal solutions that best approximate the decision structure of an expert. The method elicits the knowledge of experts from their ranking of a small set of sample alternatives. Then, the information is processed to induce implicit rules which are subsequently used to rank new alternatives. Hence, the expert's preferences are approximated by the new rankings. The proposed induction approach is demonstrated in the case study on the ranking of Negative Emission Technologies (NETs) viability for industry implementation.}

abstract = {Brass, which appears golden in color, used to be a valuable alloy in ancient times. During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the Chinese used special furnaces to smelt zinc for minting and exporting to overseas in large quantities. Archeological findings have revealed the overall structure of the zinc smelting furnaces at the Tongmuling site during the Qing Dynasty. In this study, computational fluid dynamics software was employed to simulate airflow fields within a furnace. Consequently, we observed that airflows were concentrated at the center of the lower chamber, after which they dispersed into the upper chamber through ceramic pads and finally were evenly distributed between the retorts. Increasing furnace height and improving thermal convection in the lower chamber helped increase the furnace temperature. The ceramic pads adjusted the airflow to ensure that temperature distribution in the upper chamber was uniform, and they supported burning in the upper chamber by preventing collapse. Compared with the heap smelting process recorded in Heavenly Creations and the large crucible furnaces used in modern times, zinc smelting furnaces at the Tongmuling site possess a unique structure. They serve as a link between preceding and subsequent technologies, offering important evidence for exploring the development of ancient Chinese zinc smelting technologies.}

Using Anderson's (1992a) theory of the minimal cognitive architecture of intelligence and developmental, I show how this distinction can explain the pattern of intellectual strengths and weaknesses in Savant syndrome, Williams syndrome, Down syndrome, and autism. In addition, I discuss the developmental versus difference view and the distinction between organic and cultural familial mental retardation in the light of this theory. I conclude that not only is there no inherent incompatibility between the constructs of general intelligence and modularity of mind but that both are essential to understanding the different patterns of abilities and developmental profiles found in individuals with low IQ.}

Objective: This study looks at mitigating and aggravating factors that are associated with the injury severity of pedestrians when they have crashes with another road user and overcomes existing limitations in the literature by focusing attention on the built environment and considering spatial correlation across crashes. Method: Reports for 6,539 pedestrian crashes occurred in Denmark between 2006 and 2015 were merged with geographic information system resources containing detailed information about the built environment and exposure at the crash locations. A linearized spatial logit model estimated the probability of pedestrians sustaining a severe or fatal injury conditional on the occurrence of a crash with another road user. Results: This study confirms previous findings about older pedestrians and intoxicated pedestrians being the most vulnerable road users and crashes with heavy vehicles and in roads with higher speed limits being related to the most severe outcomes. This study provides novel perspectives by showing positive spatial correlations of crashes with the same severity outcomes and emphasizing the role of the built environment in the proximity of the crash. Conclusions: This study emphasizes the need for thinking about traffic calming measures, illumination solutions, road maintenance programs, and speed limit reductions. Moreover, this study emphasizes the role of the built environment, because shopping areas, residential areas, and walking traffic density are positively related to a reduction in pedestrian injury severity. Often, these areas have in common a larger pedestrian mass that is more likely to make other road users more aware and attentive, whereas the same does not seem to apply to areas with lower pedestrian density.}

The authors assess the complexity of this project and rank it on a complexity scale to illustrate the level of knowledge and expertise required to deliver such projects. The most dominant and complex feature of AAMI Park, the bio-frame roof, which was innovative at the time, posed unique challenges. Therefore, the authors also evaluate the constraints and specific project delivery methods developed to manage best its complications. Since the adaptive management approach was used for this project, this paper assessed this approach to recommend enhanced delivery methodologies for similar future projects.

Such a topic is well covered in the literature when considering free jet conditions, i.e., jets that do not interact with any equipment or surface. The same cannot be said for high pressure jets impacting an obstacle. In this context, the present work focuses on studying high pressure methane jets impacting spherical obstacles by means of Computational Fluid Dynamics with the aim of giving some insights about such a jet-obstacle interaction, possibly providing a brief by-hand procedure that, only based on known scenario information, allows to estimate the maximum extent of the unignited high-pressure jet when interacting with a spherical obstacle.}

Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) systems offer some insight into how human memory systems may work, as they also have to solve the binding problem by knowledge-rich methods. Experimental analysis and statistical models of Memory for Individuals Task (MIT) are presented, which provide evidence that the memory representations underlying human performance consist of sets of existential facts containing no referential terms. It is shown that the proposed representations can be incorporated directly into a PDP simulation of the inference from representation to response, and that the resulting system produces human-like errors when subjected to noisy input. The PDP simulation captures some of the asymmetries between stimulus and response which the statistical model cannot.}

The project of an environmental enhancer for the Nogara mare highway in Veneto (Italy) provides the unique chance to bring together ecological thinking, host interaction and active materials. Its location (an open country planar area among cultivated fields) enucleates as critical variables the impact of pollutants and the phenomenon of dazzling. With respect to such criticalities, the project uses digital generative and parametric strategies to generate a performative structure in which densification and rarefaction of elements is a local morphological response to dazzle. The structure itself acts as a scaffold for a photo catalytic PET based material that, mimicking the behavior of coccoluti (marine microorganisms) is able to reduce CO2 (and potentially other pollutants) to salts and nitrates that are then naturally deployed to the neighboring cultivated fields as fertilizers. The material has been tested for photo catalytic integration and is currently under development. Present building and production techniques privilege the industrial assembly of inert materials, with a one-way flow of energy and process from raw material to finished product. Instead of this mono-directional energy consumption the project promotes the continuous exchange of information (as code and matter-energy) at all levels and from the digital to the material domains: use of dazzle information, morphogenetic rules and structural behavior to generate the scaffold, a photo catalytic material that responds to pollutants and produces fertilizers, making the structure symbiotic with their hosts and the environment.}

Persistent formal thought disorder (FTD) is a core feature of schizophrenia. Recent cognitive and neuroimaging studies indicate a distinct mechanistic pathway underlying the persistent positive FTD (pFTD or disorganized thinking), though its structural determinants are still elusive. Using network-based cortical thickness estimates from ultra-high field 7-Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging (7T MRI), we investigated the structural correlates of pFTD.
Methods
We obtained speech samples and 7T MRI anatomical scans from medicated clinically stable patients with schizophrenia (n¬†=¬†19) and healthy controls (n¬†=¬†20). Network-based morphometry was used to estimate the mean cortical thickness of 17 functional networks covering the entire cortical surface from each subject. We also quantified the vertexwise variability of thickness within each network to quantify the spatial coherence of the 17 networks, estimated patients vs. controls differences, and related the thickness of the affected networks to the severity of pFTD.
Results
Patients had reduced thickness of the frontoparietal and default mode networks, and reduced spatial coherence affecting the salience and the frontoparietal control network. A higher burden of positive FTD related to reduced frontoparietal thickness and reduced spatial coherence of the salience network. The presence of positive FTD, but not its severity, related to the reduced thickness of the language network comprising of the superior temporal cortex.
Conclusions
These results suggest that cortical thickness of both cognitive control and language networks underlie the positive FTD in schizophrenia. The structural integrity of cognitive control networks is a critical determinant of the expressed severity of persistent FTD in schizophrenia.}

Thus, the identification of promoters is an important research field in synthetic biology. Nannochloropsis is an important unicellular industrial oleaginous microalgae, and at present, some studies have identified some promoters with specific functions by biological methods in Nannochloropsis, whereas few studies used computational methods. Here, we propose a method called DNPPro (DenseNet-Predict-Promoter) based on densely connected convolutional neural networks to predict the promoter of Nannochloropsis. First, we collected promoter sequences from six Nannochloropsis strains and removed 80% similarity using CD-HIT for each strain to yield a reliable set of positive datasets. Then, in order to construct a robust classifier, within-group scrambling method was used to generate negative dataset which overcomes the limitation of randomly selecting a non-promoter region from the same genome as a negative sample. Finally, we constructed a densely connected convolutional neural network, with the sequence one-hot encoding as the input. Compared with commonly used sequence processing methods, DNPPro can extract long sequence features to a greater extent. The cross-strain experiment on independent dataset verifies the generalization of our method. At the same time, T-SNE visualization analysis shows that our method can effectively distinguish promoters from non-promoters.}

abstract = {Decades of research have indicated that reading self-concept is an important predictor of reading achievement. During this period, the population of emergent bilinguals has continued to increase within United States' schools. However, the existing literature has tended to examine native English speakers' and emergent bilinguals' reading self-concept in the aggregate, thereby potentially obfuscating the unique pathways through which reading self-concept predicts reading achievement. Furthermore, due to the overreliance of native English speakers in samples relating to theory development, researchers attempting to examine predictors of reading achievement may a priori select variables that are more aligned with native English speakers' experiences. To address this issue, we adopted Elastic Net, which is a theoretically agnostic methodology and machine learning approach to variable selection to identify the proximal and distal predictors of reading self-concept for the entire population; in our study, participants from the United States who participated in PISA 2018 served as the baseline group to determine significant predictors of reading self-concept with the intent of identifying potential new directions for future researchers. Based on Elastic Net analysis, 20 variables at the student level, three variables at the teacher level, and 12 variables at the school level were identified as the most salient predictors of reading self-concept. We then utilized a multilevel modeling approach to test model generalizability of the identified predictors of reading self-concept for emergent bilinguals and native English speakers. We disaggregated and compared findings for both emergent bilinguals and native English speakers. Our results indicate that although some predictors were important for both groups (e.g., perceived information and communications technologies competence), other predictors were not (e.g., competitiveness). Suggestions for future directions and implications of the present study are examined.}

However, they are good at learning statistical relationships between faults and symptoms rather than their causal relationships, resulting in poor interpretability. This paper proposes a causal discovery and inference-based fault detection and diagnosis method to address this challenge. It applies a do-calculus-based individual average causal effect estimation approach to reveal causal relationships between faults and symptoms. Based on the causal relationships discovered, a backward structural causal model is developed for fault detection and diagnosis. Regression coefficients in the model are visualized using heatmaps to explain the model reasoning processes. The method is validated using the experimental data collected by the ASHARE project RP-1312. The individual average causal effect estimation approach reveals the causal relationships between eleven air handing unit faults and twenty-eight symptoms successfully. The diagnosis accuracy of the backward structural causal model (99.58%) is almost as high as that of k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, classification and regression trees, deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks. Its hyper-parameter optimization time is reduced by 81.64% and 99.91%, respectively, compared with deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks. And its model training time is reduced by 38.61% and 92.01%, respectively. Based on the heatmap of regression coefficients of the model, it is demonstrated that the decision-making processes of the model are understandable and consistent with the domain knowledge in most cases.}

abstract = {Accurate segmentation of lesion areas plays an important role in medical imaging-assisted diagnosis and treatment. Accurate boundary information can help doctors develop precise surgical plans and improve patient prognosis. However, automatic segmentation methods often struggle to accurately segment edges due to the random shape, size, and location of regions of interest (ROI). This problem is compounded in medical images, where the difference in pixel intensity between foreground and background is significantly smaller than in natural images. In this study, we propose an aggregate-aware model with bidirectional edge generation (Ambeg) for medical image segmentation. To overcome the problem of blurred edges between foreground and background in medical images, we design a deep learning model via a multi-task learning strategy and obtain richer visual features to guide segmentation. Furthermore, an Edge Feature Fusion (EFF) module is developed to combine spatial correlation information of lesion edges between adjacent images for more accurate edge segmentation. Finally, we design a new evaluation metric, the Boundary DSC segmentation consistency measure, to evaluate the edge segmentation accuracy of medical image segmentation methods. We utilize dilation and erosion operations in morphological methods to construct lesion edge labels. In addition, we use expansion and erosion rates to regulate the dimensions of the edge region to assess the requirements of different diseases for edge segmentation accuracy. The proposed approach is particularly noteworthy for achieving state-of-the-art results on medical image segmentation datasets, including BraTS 2022 (MRI), BraTS 2020 (MRI) and COVID-19‚Äì20 (CT), which have different modalities of datasets. It has an impressive Hausdorff distance of 4.62‚ÄØmm and a sensitivity score of 92.45‚ÄØ% on BraTS 2020. Compared with existing assessment methods such as Dice score, Boundary DSC segmentation consistency measure focuses on the hard-to-segment lesion edge region rather than the easy-to-segment lesion center region, which provides a more comprehensive reference for physicians to choose automatic segmentation methods. In addition, since the boundary shapes of medical images are complex and diverse, we utilize morphological methods to obtain the boundary labels to ensure the smoothness of the boundary. Moreover, the approach is easy to implement and has a low computational cost, making it an attractive option for practical medical imaging applications.}

abstract = {Background
Timely referral for specialist evaluation in patients with advanced heart failure (HF) is a Class 1 recommendation. However, the transition from stage C HF to advanced or stage D HF often goes undetected in routine care, resulting in delayed referral and higher mortality rates.
Objectives
The authors sought to develop an augmented intelligence-enabled workflow using machine learning to identify patients with stage D HF and streamline referral.
Methods
We extracted data on HF patients with encounters from January 1, 2007, to November 30, 2020, from a HF registry within a regional, integrated health system. We created an ensemble machine learning model to predict stage C or stage D HF and integrated the results within the electronic health record.
Results
In a retrospective data set of 14,846 patients, the model had a good positive predictive value (60%) and low sensitivity (25%) for identifying stage D HF in a 100-person, physician-reviewed, holdout test set. During prospective implementation of the workflow from April 1, 2021, to February 15, 2022, 416 patients were reviewed by a clinical coordinator, with agreement between the model and the coordinator in 50.3% of stage D predictions. Twenty-four patients have been scheduled for evaluation in a HF clinic, 4 patients started an evaluation for advanced therapies, and 1¬†patient received a left ventricular assist device.
Conclusions
An augmented intelligence-enabled workflow was integrated into clinical operations to identify patients with advanced HF. Endeavors such as this require a multidisciplinary team with experience in design thinking, informatics, quality improvement, operations, and health information technology, as well as dedicated resources to monitor and improve performance over time.}

abstract = {Urban agriculture has become an important research theme in recent years. Over the past decade, a number of different, diverse value chains have been established in the urban areas of developed and developing countries alike, with increasing convergence in their motivations related to food security and livelihoods development, particularly for poor and disadvantaged segments of society. However, for urban agriculture to be sustainable as a livelihoods and resilience strategy will require decision-support tools that allow planners and participants alike to jointly develop strategies and assess potential leverage points within urban food value chains. In this paper, we argue that system dynamics (SD) models combined with participatory approaches have important roles in bridging this gap, though these will need to be adapted to the spatial influences that exist in urban settings. We first review elements of urban agriculture and some of the policy challenges faced in this growing phenomenon. We follow this by motivating the role of SD models in the context of urban agriculture and note their potential utility in overlaying quantitative models of urban food value chains alongside their land-use characteristics, highlighting the dynamic feedbacks between intensive processes within changing urban food systems and extensive processes associated with land-use and planning. From this background, we introduce the concept of spatial group model building (SGMB), which adapts standard group model building concepts to account for both the spatial context of urban agriculture and enables a spatially sensitive, participatory approach to qualitative and quantitative model building. We provide a qualitative proof-of-concept of SGMB principles and techniques in the context of describing the setting and dynamic issues facing organic urban agriculture value chains in Christchurch, New Zealand. Our approach fills an important space between participatory GIS practices and the development of complex spatial system dynamics models, infusing systems thinking principles to participatory processes, while showing a way to enhance the future development of quantitative spatial system dynamics models more generally.}

This is my current research question. If gamma synchrony is helping with the binding of information from collective sensory inputs, in ASC, when and only if the individual is motivated, then this has huge potential for how learning might be encouraged for individuals with an ASC.}

The study is focused on how feature dominance and feature distinctiveness can be naturally coded using Hebbian training, and how similarity among objects can be managed. The model includes a lexical network (which represents word-forms) and a semantic network composed of several areas: each area is topologically organized (similarity) and codes for a different feature. Synapses in the model are created using Hebb rules with different values for pre-synaptic and post-synaptic thresholds, producing patterns of asymmetrical synapses. This work uses a simple taxonomy of schematic objects (i.e., a vector of features), with shared features (to realize categories) and distinctive features (to have individual members) with different frequency of occurrence. The trained network can solve simple object recognition tasks and object naming tasks by maintaining a distinction between categories and their members, and providing a different role for dominant features vs. marginal features. Marginal features are not evoked in memory when thinking of objects, but they facilitate the reconstruction of objects when provided as input. Finally, the topological organization of features allows the recognition of objects with some modified features.}

Modelling tools were developed to facilitate tailored derivative-free optimisation solutions widely applicable to black box optimisation problems. The optimisation of a process system to recover energy and nutrients from a brewery wastewater reveals significant scope to reduce the environmental impacts of food and beverage production systems.

However, FGVC is full of challenges due to the large intra-class variation and small inter-class variation of the classes to be classified on an image. The key in dealing with the problem is to capture subtle visual differences from the image and effectively represent the discriminative features. Existing methods are often limited by insufficient localization accuracy and insufficient feature representation capabilities. In this paper, we propose a cross-layer progressive attention bilinear fusion (CPABF in short) method, which can efficiently express the characteristics of discriminative regions. The CPABF method involves three components: 1) Cross-Layer Attention (CLA) locates and reinforces the discriminative region with low computational costs; 2) The Cross-Layer Bilinear Fusion Module (CBFM) effectively integrates the semantic information from the low-level to the high-level 3) Progressive Training optimizes the parameters in the network to the best state in a delicate way. The CPABF shows excellent performance on the four FGVC datasets and outperforms some state-of-the-art methods.}

However, examining data with low spatial resolution and/or a low number of gradient directions and limitations associated with analysis approaches sensitive to registration confounds may have contributed to mixed findings concerning the regional specificity and direction of results. This study examined three major white matter tracts connecting lateral and medial temporal lobe regions with neocortical association regions widely implicated in systems-level functional and structural disturbances in schizophrenia. Using DTIstudio, a previously validated regions of interest tractography method was applied to 30 direction diffusion weighted imaging data collected from demographically similar schizophrenia (n=23) and healthy control subjects (n=22). The diffusion tensor was computed at each voxel after intra-subject registration of diffusion-weighted images. Three-dimensional tract reconstruction was performed using the Fiber Assignment by Continuous Tracking (FACT) algorithm. Tractography results showed reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) of the arcuate fasciculi (AF) and inferior longitudinal fasciculi (ILF) in patients compared to controls. FA changes within the right ILF were negatively correlated with measures of thinking disorder. Reduced volume of the left AF was also observed in patients. These results, which avoid registration issues associated with voxel-based analyses of DTI data, support that fiber pathways connecting lateral and medial temporal lobe regions with neocortical regions are compromised in schizophrenia. Disruptions of connectivity within these pathways may potentially contribute to the disturbances of memory, language, and social cognitive processing that characterize the disorder.}

We measured and compared cytokine milieu in samples collected via Softcup¬Æ menstrual cup versus vulvovaginal swabs. One hundred and eighty vulvovaginal swabs from CAPRISA 088 and 42 Softcup supernatants from CAPRISA 016 cohorts of pregnant women were used to measure the concentrations of 28 cytokines through multiplexing. Cytokines measured in this study were detectable in each of the methods however, SoftCup supernatants showed consistently, higher detectability, expression ratios, and mean concentration of cytokines than vulvovaginal swabs. While mean concentrations differed, the majority of cytokines correlated between SoftCup supernatants and vulvovaginal swabs. Additionally, there were no significant differences in a number of participants between the two sampling methods for the classification of genital inflammation. Our findings suggest that SoftCup supernatants and vulvovaginal swab samples are suitable for the collection of genital specimens to study biological markers of genital inflammatory response. However, the Softcup menstrual cup performs better for the detection and quantification of soluble biomarkers that are found in low concentrations in cervicovaginal fluid.}

SDGs are now being used by some corporations in formulating and expressing business strategies. However, assessing the effects of corporate activities and products regarding their contribution to SDGs is difficult. In this paper, we have developed a method for linking life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) with the SDGs and calculating the contribution to SDG achievement. An essential part of this approach is the weighting of LCSA impact categories, which is typically done using equal weighting. This weighting method enables compensation of negative contributions by positive contributions in different impact categories but results in ambiguity in the results. This article identifies alternative weighting methods, integrates them into a computational approach, and determines their influence on the SDG contribution scores. The analysis shows that the use of alternative weights changes SDG contribution scores. However, the same product always has the highest SDG contribution score, regardless of the weighting method used. Nonetheless, the recommendations for action with regard to the total product alternatives would change depending on the weighting method.}

abstract = {The problem we face today is that many people think that playing games only has a negative impact on a person's brain and behavior. but the fact is that playing games has a positive impact in many ways. The aim of this document is to prove whether video games can really influence human behavior on their decision-making skills. We will test 22 respondents directly who are teenagers and adults around 17 - 25 years old, and we will score them after they have finished playing games with the genre that we decided. The results proved that competitive First-person shooter (FPS) games increase human ability to make decisions quickly and correctly. Many of our participants agree that after playing competitive FPS games, they feel a positive impact on their cognitive skills. Our participants said that they can quickly compare the impact of the decisions they make and choose exactly which is the best course of action.}

The chapter begins with some cellular automata history and background, and then provides a description of Wolfram's cellular automata ‚Äúexplicit experimentation‚Äù work. The experimentation work shows that simple programs with simple rules, repeated over and over, can yield highly complex behavior. Wolfram has identified four classes of cellular automata. Those classes and their characteristics are discussed. The correspondence between cellular automata classes and the attractors of nonlinear dynamics theory is also discussed. Another of Wolfram's important insights is that the behavior of cellular automata is indicative of the behavior of systems in general. That idea is addressed in some detail. The latter part of the chapter addresses Wolfram's computational view of systems. The topics covered include computation as a framework for system principles, the concept of computational universality, and the identification of computationally universal cellular automata. Wolfram's Principle of Computational Equivalence is then described and discussed. The chapter concludes with a summary of my perspectives on the emerging complex system principles.}

abstract = {To solve the problem that mobile users cannot handle all data tasks by themselves due to the huge amount of data at present, this paper proposes a four-layer model of efficient and secure multiuser multitask computing offload. Since the user needs to offload the data to the server for processing through the wireless communication link, and users have mobility, it is difficult to achieve dynamic updates of user status and data information based on traditional cloud computing data processing methods, and it is difficult to ensure security during data unloading. In this paper, we studied how to realize the efficient and safe transmission of mobile users' data tasks when deploying Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers with artificial intelligence to assist in data processing on Unmanned Aerial vehicles (UAVs). First of all, to ensure the efficient use of computing resources, we use compression algorithms to reduce transmission overhead. Secondly, to enhance the security of the data transmission process, we have designed a security layer in the system model, which mainly uses secure multiparty technology to encrypt sensitive data, and a data transmission algorithm based on artificial intelligence is designed to assure the efficient and secure transmission of data in the network. Finally, through the analysis of the simulation results, we can know that the proposed strategy in this study has better performance than other existing strategies.}

Most of these CIs are cyber‚Äìphysical systems (CPSs), which integrate the network‚Äôs computational and communication capabilities to facilitate the monitoring and controlling of physical processes. Such systems are vulnerable to damage due to natural disasters, physical incidents, or cyber-attacks impacting the CPS organizations managing complex industrial control systems and data acquisition systems. When these CPSs are exposed to systemic cyber risks and cascaded network failures, network administrators need to recover from the compromise under limited resources. This is formulated as an attacker-defender game model to emulate the decision-making process in choosing an appropriate attack/defence mechanism in response to cybersecurity incidents using game theory. To further improve the assumptions made in the pure game-theoretic model, we relax the constraints on the rationality of the players, monetary payoff, and completeness of information by incorporating learning in games using reinforcement learning technique and compute the expected payoff using linguistic fuzzy variables.}

abstract = {Many mobile and pervasive applications avail cloud services to reduce overheads in on-device computation. The performance of these services depends on the available bandwidth of the underlying network, the physical proximity of the cloud server and the end devices, the volume of data, the computational capacity of the server, and, importantly, the mobility of the devices hosting the applications. Edge computing promises to provide better performance by bringing services (e.g., a video streaming service) from the cloud to servers near the user. It also enables partial or full offloading of the computation (tasks) and storage functionalities from the User Equipment (UE) to the edge of the network. This saves power and benefits from relatively more powerful devices at the edge. Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), which supports wireless and wired access technologies, has gained significant research interest. When UEs move, services must continue to operate, tasks may need to be offloaded again, and states related to tasks and services may need to be migrated. In this paper, we focus on four functional components (task/service offloading, resource allocation, content/task caching, and service/task migration) of MEC. We survey the challenges to these and their solutions in the context of UE mobility. Mobility creates challenges during offloading resource-intensive tasks as the user may move while the task is being offloaded. Some of the other challenges are how to jointly allocate computing and communication resources, minimize service down time during migration, and share the backhaul network if the same MEC host must continue to be used. Some key research areas include intelligent task offloading and service migration algorithms, exploiting group mobility to improve task migration time, studying the interplay of MEC parameters such as capabilities of the target MEC host, etc. In addition, predicting the mobile trajectory through intelligent methods and implementations with datasets from real-world scenarios are required. We compare this paper on 11 parameters (service migration, task offloading, resource allocation, content caching, mobility, use cases, architecture, computing paradigm, mobility model, system model, virtualization/Software Defined Networks) with 31 other survey papers from 2018 to April 2022 in MEC and related domains. We discuss the Edge Computing paradigm, the system architecture and model descriptions, and use cases. We briefly explain the relevant challenges and future directions in emerging domains, such as the Internet of drones and Digital twins. We also discuss future research directions in task/service migration, offloading, resource management, distributed computing, reliability, and Quality of Service, all related to mobility in MEC.}

Computational modeling and simulation (M&S) enables engineers to avoid many of the challenges encountered in traditional design engineering, including the design, manufacture, and testing of expensive prototypes prior to having an optimized design. However, the use of M&S carries its own challenges, such as the computational time and resources required to execute effective studies, and uncertainties arising from simplifying assumptions inherent to computer models, which are intended to be an approximate representation of reality. In recent year advances have been made in a number of areas related to the efficient and reliable use of M&S for system evaluations, including design & analysis of computer experiments, uncertainty quantification, probabilistic analysis, response optimization, and data synthesis techniques. In this review paper, a general framework for systematically executing efficient M&S studies at the component-level, product-level, system-level, and system-of-systems-level is described. A case study is used to demonstrate how statistical and probabilistic techniques can be integrated with M&S to address those challenges inherent to model-based engineering, and how this aligns with the proposed workflow. The example is a gun-launch dynamics model of an artillery projectile developed by US Army engineers, and illustrates the application of this workflow in the study of subsystem system reliability, performance, and end-to-end system-level characterization.}

Neuroscience has made obvious that human decisions are prepared by the unconsciousness. Intuition plays an important role in early and late stages of learning processes and has a crucial impact on decision-making. Thus, intuitive and unconscious thinking is crucial for management processes in general and production planning processes in the main. However, unconscious knowledge and human behaviour is predominantly neglected in production research. Especially the addressing of human machine interfaces (HMI), human cognitive biases have a crucial impact on decision making processes. Constellation work is based on unconscious knowledge and intuition. Thus, systemic structural constellations are an innovative tool to integrate unconscious knowledge in a research context. In systemic structural constellations specific foci of complex systems, such as a production system, can be simulated and represented through spatial arrangements of persons or symbols. So, the method was used to reveal relevant patterns of relationships, structures, interaction, implicit knowledge, including hidden or underlying dynamics and influences that are relevant to and within a production system to understand how the raised problems in HMI can be better solved. The guiding research question is: How can the use of structural systemic constellations improve decision-making processes in HMI contexts in production environments in order to increase sustainability? Results show sustainability seems to be a matter of consciousness and is closely linked to the bias group not enough meaning. Sustainability and complexity resemble more than being linked by trade-offs. The recognition of human biases can be trained to improve human-machine-interfaces and sustainability. Constellation work contributes to decision theory by supporting effectuation.}

A crucial component of the processing of scRNA-seq data is the precise identification of cell subpopulations. Although many unsupervised clustering methods have been developed to cluster cell subpopulations, the performance of these methods is vulnerable to dropouts and high dimensionality. In addition, most existing methods are time-consuming and fail to adequately account for potential associations between cells. In the manuscript, we present an unsupervised clustering method based on an adaptive simplified graph convolution model called scASGC. The proposed method builds plausible cell graphs, aggregates neighbor information using a simplified graph convolution model, and adaptively determines the most optimal number of convolution layers for various graphs. Experiments on 12 public datasets show that scASGC outperforms both classical and state-of-the-art clustering methods. In addition, in a study of mouse intestinal muscle containing 15,983 cells, we identified distinct marker genes based on the clustering results of scASGC.

abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) enjoy the welfare of convolution, while also bearing huge computational pressure. Therefore, model compression techniques are used to alleviate this problem, where filter-based neural network has received extensive attention as the research object of this paper. Common approaches treat filters as independent individuals and choose retrained filters by evaluating their performance, while more complex macro methods consider relationship between filters. Therefore, we propose a facile distance-based filter selection method, called FPFS, to visualize the similarity between filters from a global perspective. We calculate and sum the distance between filters to get filters‚Äô ‚ÄúDistance Weight‚Äù which is applied as a metric to assess filters. We use four common and appropriate distances for filters evaluation. To verify the performance of our algorithm, we introduce FPFS to classical DCNNs and test it on general classification datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and mageNet. For example, FPFS reduces Parameters and FLOPs of the lightweight model DenseNet-40 to about half of the original while maintain accuracy on CIFAR-10 by 94.40% (the original model is 94.80%). To ResNet-56 on CIFAR-100, FPFS compresses FLOPs to less than half of the original, while model accuracy reaches 71.46% (the original model is 71.44%). About ResNet-50 on ImageNet, FPFS achieves 60.3% FLOPs pruning rate accompanied by 0.96% top-1 accuracy loss. We also compare the experimental results with state-of-the-art filter pruning algorithms to highlight the effectiveness of FPFS.}

However, neural mechanisms of such unconscious processing remain poorly understood. Here we utilized an event-related potential (ERP) approach and sandwich mask technique to investigate cerebral activities underlying the unconscious processing of cues in creative problem solving. College students were instructed to solve divergent problems under three different conditions (conscious cue, unconscious cue and no-cue conditions). Our data showed that creative problem solving can benefit from unconscious cues, although not as much as from conscious cues. More importantly, we found that there are crucial ERP components associated with unconscious processing of cues in solving divergent problems. Similar to the processing of conscious cues, processing unconscious cues in problem solving involves the semantic activation of unconscious cues (N280‚Äì340) in the right inferior parietal lobule (BA 40), new association formation (P350‚Äì450) in the right parahippocampal gyrus (BA 36), and mental representation transformation (P500‚Äì760) in the right superior temporal gyrus (BA 22).

Building on the multidisciplinary literature on the relationship between frames and decision-making, it argues that decision-makers may gain from making frames more explicit and using them for generating different visions about the central issues. Frames act as organizing principles that shape in a ‚Äúhidden‚Äù and taken-for-granted way how people conceptualize an issue. Science-related issues, such as climate change, are often linked to only a few frames, which consistently appear across different policy areas. Indeed, it appears that there are some very contrasting ways in which climate change may be framed. These frames can be characterized in terms of a simple framework that highlights specific interpretations of climate issues. A second framework clarifies the built-in frames of decision tools. Using Thompson's two basic dimensions of decision, it identifies the main uncertainties that should be considered in developing a decision strategy. The paper characterizes four types of decision strategy, focusing on (1) computation, (2) compromise, (3) judgment, or (4) inspiration, and links each strategy to the appropriate methods and tools, as well as the appropriate social structures. Our experiences show that the frame-based guide can work as an eye-opener for decision-makers, particularly where it demonstrates how to add more perspectives to the decision.}

Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This chapter will summarize the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework.}

These theories are used here as an inspiration for implementing a computational model of semantic memory in the form of semantic network. Combining this network with a vector-based object-relation-feature value representation of concepts that includes also weights for confidence and support, allows for recognition of concepts by referring to their features, enabling a semantic search algorithm. This algorithm has been used for word games, in particular the 20-question game in which the program tries to guess a concept that a human player thinks about. The game facilitates lexical knowledge validation and acquisition through the interaction with humans via supervised dialog templates. The elementary linguistic competencies of the proposed model have been evaluated assessing how well it can represent the meaning of linguistic concepts. To study properties of information retrieval based on this type of semantic representation in contexts derived from on-going dialogs experiments in limited domains have been performed. Several similarity measures have been used to compare the completeness of knowledge retrieved automatically and corrected through active dialogs to a ‚Äúgolden standard‚Äù. Comparison of semantic search with human performance has been made in a series of 20-question games. On average results achieved by human players were better than those obtained by semantic search, but not by a wide margin.}

This study presents a formal grammar for Hutong neighbourhood generation. This research investigates traditional principles of urban planning of ancient Beijing, based on examples on the historical map Qianlong Jingcheng Quantu, to derive the lost design rules. These rules are used to build up a procedural modelling framework, which reveals the development of Beijing's urban structure from the Yuan (1271‚Äì1368) to the Qing (1644‚Äì1911) dynasty. Our findings present a grammar incorporated into the procedural modelling framework to parametrically generate Hutong neighbourhoods, which replicates the morphological characteristics of historic cases. It contributes to the understanding of the generation of Hutong neighbourhoods. In support of heritage sustainability, this grammar can be implemented in a computational environment by visual scripting that enables the generation of new instances of Hutong neighbourhoods, both real and virtual.}

Postpartum depression is a commonly known consequence of childbirth for both mothers and fathers. In this research, we computationally analyze the risk factors and lack of support received by fathers. Therefore, we use shared mental models to model the effects of poor and additional communication by healthcare practitioners to mitigate the development of postpartum depression in both the mother and the father. Both individual mental models and shared mental models are considered in the design of the computational model. The paper illustrates the benefits of simple support in terms of communication during childbirth, which has lasting effects, even outside the hospital. For the impact of additional communication, a Virtual Safety Coach is designed that intervenes when necessary to provide support, i.e., when a health care practitioner doesn‚Äôt. Moreover, organizational learning is also modelled to improve the mental models of both the Safety Coach and the Health Care Practitioner.}

By organizing a conference devoted to this theme, we sought to honor the contributions of pioneering, field-based geomorphologists and to encourage our community to contemplate how field work might continue to provide unique insight into a new, more technologically-driven era. For example, given recent advances in remote sensing methods such as LiDAR, what kind of added value can field work provide? Similarly, how can field-based studies contribute to societally relevant, large-scale questions related to climate change and sustainable management of the Earth system? Motivated by such questions, the 2012 BGS was convened in Jackson Hole, WY, a new, Western location that enabled participation by Rocky Mountain and west coast research groups underrepresented at previous Binghamton symposia. Also, in keeping with the field tradition theme, the 2012 BGS emphasized field trips, including a rafting excursion down the Snake River and an overview of the tectonic and glacial history of Jackson Hole. The on-site portion of the symposium consisted of invited oral and poster presentations and contributed posters, including many by graduate students. Topics ranged from an historical overview of the development of geomorphic thinking to long-term sediment tracer studies to a commentary on the synergy between LiDAR and field mapping. This special issue of Geomorphology consists of papers by invited authors from the 2012 BGS, and this overview provides some context for these contributions. Looking forward, we hope that the 43rd annual BGS will stimulate further discussion of the role of field work as the discipline of geomorphology continues to evolve, carrying on the field tradition into the future.}

The increased integration of making into K-12 curricula has enormous implications not only for instructional design but also for assessment practices. Maker-oriented activities have the potential to shed light on types of learning that previous assessment systems have not captured and examined. Nevertheless, little is discussed on how making can contribute to the assessment and instructional practices at large. This case study investigated educators' experiences with assessment in classrooms integrating maker activities. Through a qualitative analysis of interviews with six K-12 educators in Canada, the researchers examined: (1) in what ways does making activities create opportunities for assessment and instruction in K-12 classrooms? (2) in what ways does maker learning become a challenge for assessment and instruction in K-12 classrooms? Our analysis revealed several ways in which teachers experienced the advantages of the making approach for understanding student learning and for helping students become further aware of their own progress. The results also revealed challenges to conducting assessments for maker learning, including administrative challenges like continuing to gain support from the administration, and literacy challenges such as students‚Äô obsession with letter grades. This study provides insights into how making may help improve assessment and instructional practices in K-12 classrooms.}

This paper proposes a new bi-objective integer linear programming model for this problem. Decisions include the choice of the best itinerary to be performed considering multi-period routing, time windows for the visited attractions and the choice of restaurants and hotels. The conflicting objectives considered are: (i) maximizing the level of service offered by the itinerary, and (ii) minimizing the total distance traveled. The problem resolution, even for small instances by exact methods, is limited. This motivated the proposition of a new customized MIP-heuristic based on decomposition, fix-and-optimize and MIP-start, to produce good-quality solutions with moderate computational effort. Tchebycheff‚Äôs scalarization method was coupled to this heuristic and multiple compromise solutions were obtained. Extensive results with problem instances of different sizes and characteristics showed a good performance of this approach, capable of producing effective solutions within short runtimes. The analysis of the solutions indicated a strong conflict between the objectives, allowing the user to quantify the losses and gains when one criterion is prioritized over the other. A brief sensitivity analysis of some model parameters revealed interesting managerial insights. Some examples include quantifying the negative impacts in terms of the level of service offered by concentrating hotels and restaurants in the center of tourist attractions, increasing visit and transfer times between attractions and reducing the planning horizon for the entire itinerary. These aspects validate the potential of using this MIP model and applying this MIP-heuristic in real situations.}

The malfunction of a machine learning system, ML, can occur due lack of knowledge of the algorithm intended behavior. The difficulty in debugging ML can be overcome by using strategies based on the universal structure of language that overlaps in the cognitive architecture of biological and intelligent systems. The appropriate choice of an algorithm inspired by the functioning of human language offers the computational scientist methodological strategies to clarify its performance analysis to optimize the interpretative activity under the good instrumentation of the system and to reach the performance level of an application considered safe. Neurolinguistic principles that link interpretation to language and cognition; the semantic dimension that arises not only from the linguistic system, but also from the context in which the information is produced; and the theoretical bases for understanding language as a 'form' (process) and not as a substance (set of signs) provide the groundwork for the intelligent systems‚Äô improvement so that they have universal consistency and lessen the effects of the ‚Äòcurse of dimensionality‚Äô or of the bias in the interpretation by the system. Semantics and statistics are considered to understand universal consistency as opposed to ideal consistency when evaluating a data set, since training alone is not sufficient to avoid data manipulation. We conclude that the 'key' for a good information classifier to achieve an acceptable performance of neural networks is in the dynamic aspect of language (language as a form / process) that: Guides the apprehension of how neural networks have access to weights (values); replicates this for intelligent systems making them invariant to many input transformations and guarantees an infinite amount of finite sample information, avoiding semantic distortion.}

The study aims to explore the spatial mapping relationship between the general knowledge base and the professional knowledge base for the application of the general knowledge map in professional fields. With the core resource database (CRD) as the main body of the general knowledge and the institutional repository (IR) as the main body of the professional knowledge, the conceptual features of institutional expert knowledge were firstly abstracted from IR and inferred from small-scale datasets and the mathematical model was established based on the similarity of text concepts and related ranking results. Then, a two-set concept space mapping algorithm between CRD and IR was designed. In the algorithm, the more granular concept nodes were extracted from the information on the shortest paths among concepts to obtain a new knowledge set, the Expert Knowledge Recommendation System (EKRS). Finally, the simulation experiment was carried out with open datasets to verify the algorithm. The simulation results showed that the algorithm reduced the structural complexity in the calculation of large datasets. The proposed system model had a clear knowledge structure and the recommended accuracy of the text similarity was high. For small-scale knowledge base datasets with different sparsity, the system showed the stable performance, indicating the better convergence and robustness of the algorithm.}

An oracle A is low for speed if relativizing to A has essentially no effect on computational complexity, meaning that if a decidable language can be decided in time f(n) with access to oracle A, then it can be decided in time poly(f(n)) without any oracle. The existence of non-computable such A's was later proven by Bayer and Slaman, who even constructed a computably enumerable one, and exhibited a number of properties of these oracles.
