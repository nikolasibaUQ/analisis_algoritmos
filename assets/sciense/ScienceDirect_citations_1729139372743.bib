abstract = {Theory-driven and data-driven computational approaches to psychiatry have enormous potential for elucidating mechanism of disease and providing translational linkages between basic science findings and the clinic. These approaches have already demonstrated utility in providing clinically relevant understanding, primarily via back translation from clinic to computation, revealing how specific disorders or symptoms map onto specific computational processes. Nonetheless, forward translation, from computation to clinic, remains rare. In addition, consensus regarding specific barriers to forward translation—and on the best strategies to overcome these barriers—is limited. This perspective review brings together expert basic and computationally trained researchers and clinicians to 1) identify challenges specific to preclinical model systems and clinical translation of computational models of cognition and affect, and 2) discuss practical approaches to overcoming these challenges. In doing so, we highlight recent evidence for the ability of computational approaches to predict treatment responses in psychiatric disorders and discuss considerations for maximizing the clinical relevance of such models (e.g., via longitudinal testing) and the likelihood of stakeholder adoption (e.g., via cost-effectiveness analyses).}

abstract = {The Drosophila eggshell is an elaborate structure that is derived from a monolayer of follicular epithelium surrounding the developing oocyte within the female ovary. The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway is essential for controlling the patterning and morphogenesis of the eggshell. During oogenesis, the roles of patterning and morphogenesis by the BMP type I receptor thickveins (tkv) have been studied extensively. However, signaling through this pathway requires both type I and II receptors, and the latter has yet to be established in oogenesis. We focus on wishful thinking (wit), the Drosophila homolog to the mammalian BMP type II receptor, BMPRII. We found that wit is expressed dynamically in the FCs of D. melanogaster in an evolutionary conserved pattern. The expression patterns are highly correlated with the dynamics of the BMP signaling, which is consistent with our finding that wit is a target of BMP signaling. Furthermore, we established that WIT is necessary for BMP signaling, and loss of WIT is associated with cell autonomous loss of BMP responses. Of importance, we demonstrated that perturbations in WIT led to changes in eggshell morphologies in domains that are patterned by BMP signaling. Previous studies have shown a role for WIT in BMP signaling during neurogenesis; however, our results reveal a role for WIT in epithelial cells' development.}

However, there is a noticeable gap in understanding its influence on students' cognitive development from a multilevel perspective. This study delves into cognitive learning theories and aims to bridge the existing gap by introducing a three-level conceptual model to illustrate how the influence of SCP on students' cognitive CT abilities is mediated through the cognitive learning processes. This multilevel approach simultaneously explores SCP within the intricate school environment where factors at the school, teacher, and student levels are closely intertwined. Data was collected from 82 programming teachers and their 2433 students across 43 Hong Kong primary schools. Using multilevel modeling, results indicate that the adoption of SCP is significantly anchored by school support on teacher professional development (TPD), which in turn enhances students’ cognitive learning (i.e., active, interactive, constructive, and reflective learning) in class, further contributing to their enhanced cognitive CT abilities. The findings underscore the nuances of SCP adoption in school scenarios, advocating for strategic approaches to maximize student achievements in CT education. Recommendations for future research are discussed.}

However, interoperability challenges between retailer organizations and manufacturers present a barrier to decision-making processes and impact the human-centric nature of the IoV. Ethical dilemmas arise as a result of the IoV’s inability to prevent accidents, particularly in critical situations. This study aims to enhance the IoV’s effectiveness by carefully selecting and improving essential attributes from various data sources, including sensors, GPS, 5G or 6G communication networks, and real-time data provisioning. To achieve the aim of the proposed study, a Multi-criterion Decision-making (MCDM) approach is proposed, which allows for the analysis and selection of optimal choices while taking into account various quantitative and qualitative factors. Despite the challenges posed by complex models and ambiguous data, MCDM remains an indispensable technique for aligning transportation systems with current expectations. The CRITIC and TOPSIS MCDM-enabled methodologies are employed to analyze IoV architecture, prioritizing significant elements that impact system performance and identifying optimal solutions by considering complications from worst-case scenarios. The study will assist engineers, scientists, and organizations to develop smart IoV systems that will cater to human needs by improving mobility and inspiration among users.}

Across the problem solving tasks, Chinese students had higher success rates than US students. The disparities appear to be related to students’ use of differing strategies. Chinese students tend to choose abstract strategies and symbolic representations while US students favor concrete strategies and drawing representations. If the analysis is limited to those students who used concrete strategies, the success rates between the two samples become almost identical. With regard to problem posing, the US and Chinese samples both produce problems of various types, though the types occur in differing sequences. Finally, this study revealed differential relationships between problem posing and problem solving for US and Chinese students. There was a much stronger link between problem solving and problem posing for the Chinese sample than there was for the US sample.}

The findings provide novel evidence for multimodal theories of enriched learning, challenge assumptions of longstanding cognitive theories, and provide counterevidence to unimodal neurobiologically inspired theories. Enriched educational methods are likely effective not only because they may engage greater levels of attention or deeper levels of processing, but also because multimodal interactions in the brain can enhance learning and memory.}

By working with blind individuals, we can ask both what kinds of representations people form about others’ minds, and how much these representations depend on the observer having had similar mental states themselves. Thinking about others’ mental states depends on a specific group of brain regions, including the right temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ). We investigated the representations of others’ mental states in these brain regions, using multivoxel pattern analyses (MVPA). We found that, first, in the RTPJ of sighted adults, the pattern of neural response distinguished the source of the mental state (did the protagonist see or hear something?) but not the valence (did the protagonist feel good or bad?). Second, these neural representations were preserved in congenitally blind adults. These results suggest that the temporo-parietal junction contains explicit, abstract representations of features of others’ mental states, including the perceptual source. The persistence of these representations in congenitally blind adults, who have no first-person experience with sight, provides evidence that these representations emerge even in the absence of relevant first-person perceptual experiences.}

Text-objects imply fragments of a user's idea, which have several keywords given by him/her. Spaces composed of text-objects are configured in the way “the higher the mutual relevance between a pair of text-objects is, the closer the text-objects are mapped”. The relevance values among text-objects are calculated due to cooccurrence of their keywords.

abstract = {This article introduces differentiated creative search (DCS), a groundbreaking optimization algorithm that revolutionizes traditional decision-making systems in complex environments. In contrast to conventional differential evolution methods, DCS integrates a unique knowledge-acquisition process with a creative realism paradigm, thereby transforming optimization strategies. The primary aim of DCS is to enhance decision-making efficacy by employing a newly proposed dual-strategy approach that balances divergent and convergent thinking within a team-based framework. High-performing members apply divergent thinking via the DCS/Xrand/Linnik(α,σ) strategy, which incorporates existing knowledge and Linnik flights. Conversely, the remaining team harnesses convergent thinking through the DCS/Xbest/Current-to-2rand strategy, which combines insights from both the team leader and fellow members. This division of labor, coupled with a strategy tailored to the performance levels of team members, allows for a dynamic and effective decision-making process. The methodology of DCS involves iterative cycles of divergent and convergent thinking, supported by a differentiated knowledge-acquisition process and retrospective assessments. The algorithm's novelty lies in its differentiated knowledge-acquisition, adjusted based on individual team member performance, fostering an environment of continuous learning and adaptation. The paper's contributions are demonstrated through rigorous testing of DCS on various benchmark functions, including CEC2017, classical, and sensor selection problems, as well as real-world applications such as car side impact design, gear train design, and FM sound wave parameter estimation. The results showcase the promising performance of DCS compared to that of existing algorithms, attributable to its innovative approach to problem solving and decision making in complex scenarios. The results and impact section highlights that DCS considerably outperforms traditional optimization algorithms, offering a robust and versatile tool for complex decision-making systems. Its impact is particularly notable in scenarios requiring a balance between innovative solutions and practical decision-making, making DCS a valuable asset in strategic planning and execution across various industries.}

abstract = {An analytical and adaptive parameter extraction method is proposed to accurately and efficiently extract the parameters of solar cells' triple-diode lumped-parameter equivalent circuit model. This method can obtain explicit expressions of parameters, facilitating seamless integration into photovoltaic systems for circuit-level simulation and design. The proposed method addresses the lack of analytical parameter extraction methods for triple-diode model, avoids the iteration of numerical methods, and significantly reduces computational complexity, thus improving the overall efficiency of the modeling process. In this method, the principle of effective-diode-based analysis is used to simplify the complex multi-diode model. Recursive thinking is then combined to adaptively extract all parameters through multiple steps according to the number of diodes in the model. Subsequently, the practicability of this method is evaluated by testing on three different equivalent circuit models of solar cells including the single-, double-, and triple-diode models. Furthermore, the universality of this method is demonstrated by testing on three photovoltaic modules of different types including Mono-crystalline, Multi-crystalline, Thin-film, and perovskite solar cells at different temperatures and irradiances. Finally, the simulation results based on the extracted parameters are compared with the experimental data to calculate the root mean square error (RMSE) magnitude, which ranges from 10−5 to 10−3, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed method. As a result, this analytical parameter extraction method provides a robust tool and approach for research and applications in the field of solar cell modeling.}

To evaluate the relative importance of different cognitive processes to OCD, we administered an expanded CSC scale and two state-of-the-art measures of thought appraisals and beliefs. Scores on the CSC scale reliably differentiated OCD patients (n=30), from an anxious comparison group (OAD, n=25) after controlling for scores on the two cognition measures. The tendency to excessively reflect upon one’s cognitive processes may increase opportunities for negative appraisals of intrusive thoughts, foster over-importance of thought beliefs, and increase the likelihood of developing OCD.}

This paper presents an approach using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based simulations to compare the numerical predictions with the original architectural insight for a verification of the architect's thinking in his realization of the design purpose. In the analysis, we consider the incompressible isothermal turbulent airflow to examine the interaction of the flow with the building for a better understanding of the wind-driven self-sustaining ventilation mechanism. We also propose a modified model via enlarging the aeration opening with the least blockages along the wind pathway.

This paper, firstly, presents and discusses a biologically inspired design approach, based on biomimicry thinking (BT). Besides integrating linguistic tools and brainstorming within the BT approach, the importance of a stricter integration with the engineering context is also discussed. Secondly, the paper presents a practical application of this approach: design an innovative and sustainable oilwater separation device. In particular, the application of the proposed approach allowed identifying a bioinspired solution capable to improve the process performances in a device based on a known strategy. More in detail, the adopted bioinspired solution consists of a superoleophobic surface that mimics the microstructure of the filefish scale surface and eases the oilwater separation process by hindering oil drops deposition on some surfaces. The cost and resource effectiveness of the practical realisation of this surface greatly benefited by the latest advancements in the additive manufacturing field.}

abstract = {Construction material offcuts is a data problem that can largely be avoided by dimensional coordination during concept design. Besides the environmental benefits, early phase coordination is beneficial to the overall design process as it integrates information not typically considered until later in the design process. However, taking reality-changing actions is often challenged by uncertainty, time constraints, and lack of integration of available tools. Acknowledging the potential of computational design in enabling architects to manage design and coordination complexities and taking plasterboard opportunities for dimensional coordination, the paper presents a review and assessment of the existing methods to interrogate what, when, and how are these adaptable to the task. The study shows that ML-based methods outperform other methods and concludes that leveraging computational design powers to reduce offcuts is not a question of a tool, but one of a strategy. Eventually, the future steps to achieving such a strategy are discussed.}

We are not satisfied by what mainstream legal scholarship has on offer in this context. Positivists consider the issue outside their domain. Realists (including their critical branch) focus on the behavior of legal institutions, ignoring many of the diverse institutions that have regulatory force. We need an additional, complementary perspective to help us, legal scholars, earn and hold serious positions in the diverse disciplinary teams that we need to participate in, in order to adequately investigate (and inform on) persistent problems concerning personal-data protection as faced by legislators. In this article we investigate whether the subject matter of data protection law, identified as Personal Data Community (hereinafter PDC), can be treated as a complex adaptive system (hereinafter CAS). This proposition is premised on the argument that the PDC exhibits key traits of CAS, including systemic, dynamic and complex characteristics. And we further show how complexity theory can help legal scholarship (without losing its identity) to join and add value to diverse disciplinary research and advisory teams. In this article, we aim for a stepping-stone (establishing that data protection law addresses a complex adaptive system with all of its corollaries), rather than for final solutions.}

In general, North American travellers mainly leaned towards analytic thinking, whereas Chinese travellers showcased a blend of holistic and analytic thought processes. The topic of travel, leisure and accommodation showed both holistic and analytic thinking styles. The topics of nature and environment, front desk service, and travel routes and scenic spot areas mainly represented a holistic thinking style. The topics of convenience and facilities, breakfast, transportation, hotel theme and features, and decoration and amenities mainly suggested an analytic thinking style. Hotels should consider the different perception styles of Chinese and North American travellers to facilitate strategies accordingly and to maximize the experience of travellers from different cultural backgrounds.}

Life Cycle Assessment (LCAs) of energy efficiency and environmental performance of buildings are deemed critical to address sustainable development issues. This paper aims to investigate LCA as a tool to support the design of buildings with two objectives in mind. Firstly, it determines the role of LCA in the evaluation of energy efficiency and environmental performance of buildings. Secondly, it elaborates LCA of these constructions through the lens of international standards. The methodological approach of the study leads to development of a whole building life cycle formula that sums up the contributions from a set of LCAs. By doing so, the paper highlights the necessity of LCA applications in buildings, and the need for minimisation of resource and energy consumption, and environmental impact. The study helps in better understanding the way LCA supports the search for and identification of innovation pathways in buildings. This paper contributes to the efforts in providing theoretical expansions in LCA of buildings and stimulates the creation of technical standards for the residential building construction sector.}

It has capability to store high energy, which makes them applicable in the healthcare system. “Executable biology” is applied to the computational model of physiological processes. These models have the advantage of computer science and simulation of pharmacokinetic study. Because of their high potential and computational power, they are widely accepted in pharmaceutical research. US-FDA has tested and utilized computational models in manufacturing various pharmaceutical equipment's that also can be used in drug discovery and manufacturing. These models can create exact validated in vitro and in vivo pharmacological systems, which helps to obtain faster, accurate and more pertinent human data. These models suffer from simplicity, versatility and lack of cumulative research. Multiscale simulations, like the ones based on coarse-graining, are important areas for future research. More significantly, a collaboration between the pharmaceutical industry and computational scientists involved in this field could assist in work in areas wherein molecular dynamic simulations can influence substantially. In this review, different drug target identification models via chemo genomic methods are explained, and the advantages of computational modeling over mathematical model is studied. It also focuses on a wide range of simulation techniques, biomedical applications and challenges of computational modelling.

The proposed BCM implements with the two main steps. First, we combine free energy principle and sparse perception mechanism to achieve the goal of only using extremely few reference for assessing the image quality. Second, we further introduce the attention perception mechanism to boost the assessment performance by improving the sparse perception mechanism mentioned above. Based on the most commonly used image quality database, it was found that our proposed model has derived higher performance than the peer extremely few reference IQA models and competitive performance as compared with the benchmark full reference IQA models.}

In this paper to improve the harmonic quality, the symmetry angles constraints are not considered leading to a new OPP method: Phases Symmetry Relaxation (PSR).

Conventional antibiotics no longer offer adequate protection due to the evolution of strategies to evade them. As a result, efforts are needed to design novel replacement antibiotics, making them unique from most other forms of drug development. As drug discovery costs have steadily increased along with the need for novel antibiotics, the interest in antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as alternative antimicrobial treatments has grown in recent years. As a complement to experimental high-throughput screening, computational methods have become essential in hit and lead discovery in pharmaceutical research. It may be possible to access unexplored chemical space with customized virtual compound libraries. It has been questioned whether screening billions of molecules virtually with the risk of false positives is practical despite their unlimited potential size. In terms of finding novel chemical compounds capable of solving many global problems, machine learning, deep learning, and generative models hold significant promise. It is anticipated that the current challenges and limitations about the applicability of the stated approaches will be overcome in the coming years. However, plenty of advances are still required to achieve their full potential. In this perspective, we review the previous and ongoing work based on the latest scientific breakthroughs and technologies that could offer new opportunities and alternative strategies for developing novel AMPs.}

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy education was previously taught primarily at the university and secondary school levels but has recently started to be expanded to primary school settings. When available at the primary school level, AI literacy is often taught within computer science courses, which may potentially reinforce gender stereotypes and discourage female students’ engagement. In AI literacy education, the predominant teaching methods are constructivist approaches, which, while effective in fostering active learning, heavily emphasize technical skills and are therefore limited in their pedagogical scope, as they underplay other important questions, such as disinformation, data justice, and AI’s ethical and societal implications. The lack of a clear definition of AI literacy for primary education also raises questions about what to teach and how to teach it. Additionally, little attention has been devoted to understanding gender differences in learning outcomes within AI literacy primary education. This study advocates the use of an arts-based transdisciplinary approach for teaching AI literacy to 25 primary school students. A pilot study utilizing mixed methods was conducted to assess the effectiveness of this arts-based approach. Quantitative analysis through a paired t-test revealed a statistically significant improvement in AI literacy among students participating in knowledge tests. Moreover, the results of the Mann‒Whitney and Kruskal‒Wallis tests indicated that gender and age did not impact pre- and post-knowledge test scores. Qualitative analyses further revealed the pedagogical benefits of the arts-based approach, demonstrating that students enhance their conceptual understanding of AI literacy by reflecting on their artifacts. This study contributes to the literature by providing evidence with a small sample size that the arts-based approach can overcome age and gender barriers to accessing AI literacy education and can serve as a means to teach AI thinking.}

In Finland, a new curriculum for grades 1–9 came into force in 2016 introducing digital competence (including programming) to be integrated in other subjects. Most teachers lack prior experience in programming and there is a need for suitable instructional models. This article presents a cross-curricular teaching sequence and the results from a case study conducted in four Finnish schools. Students in grades 4–6 collaboratively worked on a project combining arts, design and CT with other subjects. The results show that students demonstrated several CT abilities while working on their projects, in particular creativity, tinkering and debugging. The findings also indicate that teachers and students learned together (co-agency) and suggest that models like the teaching sequence can help and encourage teachers to integrate programming and CT in a cross-curricular manner. Still, the teachers’ knowledge, ambition level and understanding of the task at hand, as well as the organizational support appear to play a notable role when planning and carrying out projects of this kind. While CT is commonly seen as developed through programming, the teaching sequence seems to have fostered CT abilities through the project as a whole, with programming playing the role of a tool or a glue depending on the time available, and the students’ skill and ambition level.}

It relies on the research and reflections within the larger advanced concepts research community created by and around the European Space Agency's Advanced Concepts Team as well as the results of a two-day long symposium in July 2012, including Europe's first space ‘un-conference’, focussed on re-thinking the future of space beyond the traditional thought boundaries of the space sector. For this purpose it reviews visions and expectations formulated at the creation of the ACT, results obtained and fundamental changes that are expected to shape space activities and the space sector in a 10–15+ years time frame, while relaying these to specific ongoing research activities.}

Yet, despite these astronomical advances, there are presently no well-confirmed tests against which to check the design of interstellar messages. In the meantime, the best we can do is distance ourselves from terracentric assumptions. There is no reason, for example, to assume that all inferential abilities are language-like. With that in mind, I argue that logical reasoning does not have to be couched in symbolic notation. In diagrammatic reasoning, inferences are underwritten, not by rules, but by transformations of self-same qualitative signs. I use the Existential Graphs of C. S. Peirce to show this. Since diagrams are less dependent on convention and might even be generalized to cover non-visual senses, I argue that METI researchers should add some form of diagrammatic representations to their repertoire. Doing so can shed light, not just on alien minds, but on the deepest structures of reasoning itself.}

abstract = {Decision-making in groups is a remarkable and decisive element of human societies. Humans are able to organize themselves in groups, engage in collaborative decision-making processes and arrive at a binding agreement, even in the absence of unanimous consent. However, the transfer of decision-making autonomy requires a willingness to deliberately expose oneself to the decisions of others. A lack of trust in the abilities of others or of the underlying decision-making process, i.e. public trust, can lead to a breakdown of organizations in political or economic domains. Recent studies indicate that the biological basis of trust on an individual level is related to Oxytocin, an endogenous neuropeptide and hormone, which is also associated with pro-social behavior and positive conflict resolution. However, little is known about the effects of Oxytocin on the inclination of individuals to form or join groups and to deliberately engage in collaborative decision-making processes. Here, we show that intranasal administration of Oxytocin (n = 60) compared to placebo (n = 60) in males causes an adverse effect on the choice for forming groups in the presence of a competitive environment. In particular, Oxytocin negatively affects the willingness to work collaboratively in a p-Beauty contest game, whereas the effect is most pronounced for participants with relatively high strategic sophistication. Since our data provide initial evidence that Oxytocin has a positive effect on strategic thinking and performance in the p-Beauty contest game, we argue that the adverse effect on group formation might be rooted in an enhanced strategic sophistication of participants treated with Oxytocin.}

Thematic relations are distinct from mere associations, scripts, and ad hoc categories. They also contrast and complement taxonomic (categorical) relations such as “fruits” and “furniture.” Thematic relations and taxonomic relations arise from distinct processes, as evidenced by numerous neuropsychological and behavioral dissociations. Thematic relations may be apprehended uncontrollably and rapidly according to how frequently and recently they have been encountered. They exert profound effects on many core cognitive processes, including similarity, categorization, memory, language, inference, and analogy, and they exhibit robust processing differences across individuals and cultures.

The driver of this framework is a computational version of reflective equilibrium (RE), an approach that seeks coherence between considered judgments and governing principles. The framework has two goals: (i) to inform the engineering of ethical AI systems, and (ii) to characterize human moral judgment and decision-making in computational terms. Working jointly towards these two goals will create the opportunity to integrate diverse research questions, bring together multiple academic communities, uncover new interdisciplinary research topics, and shed light on centuries-old philosophical questions.}

With specific focus on the LVTS, the paper presents a structural model where the payments system represents a market in which bilateral credit limits are the pricing mechanisms for intraday liquidity provisioning and the credit risk arising from the loss sharing arrangement. The data-driven stochastic game framework further illustrates how payments data, in conjunction with other financial market and credit data, can be used to assess emergent macroscopic outcomes in clearing and settlement systems from the underpinning interactions of autonomous decision making agents.

Learning in social interactions is critical for bond formation and acquiring knowledge. Importantly, this type of learning is typically bi-directional, as both partners learn about each other simultaneously. Here we review the literature on social learning and propose a new computational and neural model characterizing mutual predictions that take place within and between interactions. According to our model, each partner in the interaction attempts to minimize the prediction error of the self and the interaction partner. In most cases, these inferential models become similar over time, thus enabling mutual understanding to develop. At the neural level, this type of social learning may be supported by interbrain plasticity, defined as a change in interbrain coupling over time in neural networks associated with social learning, among them the mentalizing network, the observation-execution system, and the hippocampus. The mutual prediction model constitutes a promising means of providing empirically verifiable accounts of how relationships develop over time.}

Misophonia is a disorder in which certain sounds produced by other people lead to intense negative reactions. It remains unknown how misophonia relates to other psychiatric conditions or impairments. To identify latent constructs underlying symptoms, we conducted a factor analysis consisting of items from questionnaires assessing symptoms of misophonia and other psychiatric conditions. One thousand forty-two participants completed the questionnaires and a social exchange task in which they either could (“controllable”) or could not (“uncontrollable”) influence future monetary offers from other people. Misophonia and obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms loaded onto the same factor. Compared with individuals with low Miso-OC factor scores, individuals with high scores reported higher perceived controllability of their social interactions during the uncontrollable condition and stronger aversion to social norm violations in the uncontrollable compared with the controllable condition. Together, these results suggest misophonia, and OC symptoms share a latent psychiatric dimension characterized by aberrant computations of social controllability.}

Replay in the brain has been viewed as rehearsal or, more recently, as sampling from a transition model. Here, we propose a new hypothesis: that replay is able to implement a form of compositional computation where entities are assembled into relationally bound structures to derive qualitatively new knowledge. This idea builds on recent advances in neuroscience, which indicate that the hippocampus flexibly binds objects to generalizable roles and that replay strings these role-bound objects into compound statements. We suggest experiments to test our hypothesis, and we end by noting the implications for AI systems which lack the human ability to radically generalize past experience to solve new problems.}

abstract = {Understanding cognition has been a central focus for psychologists, neuroscientists and philosophers for thousands of years, but many of its most fundamental processes remain very poorly understood. Chief among these is the process of thought itself: the spontaneous emergence of specific ideas within the stream of consciousness. It is widely accepted that ideas, both familiar and novel, arise from the combination of existing concepts. From this perspective, thought is an emergent attribute of memory, arising from the intrinsic dynamics of the neural substrate in which information is embedded. An important issue in any understanding of this process is the relationship between the emergence of conceptual combinations and the dynamics of the underlying neural networks. Virtually all theories of ideation hypothesize that ideas arise during the thought process through association, each one triggering the next through some type of linkage, e.g., structural analogy, semantic similarity, polysemy, etc. In particular, it has been suggested that the creativity of ideation in individuals reflects the qualitative structure of conceptual associations in their minds. Interestingly, psycholinguistic studies have shown that semantic networks across many languages have a particular type of structure with small-world, scale free connectivity. So far, however, these related insights have not been brought together, in part because there has been no explicitly neural model for the dynamics of spontaneous thought. Recently, we have developed such a model. Though simplistic and abstract, this model attempts to capture the most basic aspects of the process hypothesized by theoretical models within a neurodynamical framework. It represents semantic memory as a recurrent semantic neural network with itinerant dynamics. Conceptual combinations arise through this dynamics as co-active groups of neural units, and either dissolve quickly or persist for a time as emergent metastable attractors and are recognized consciously as ideas. The work presented in this paper describes this model in detail, and uses it to systematically study the relationship between the structure of conceptual associations in the neural substrate and the ideas arising from this system’s dynamics. In particular, we consider how the small-world and scale-free characteristics influence the effectiveness of the thought process under several metrics, and show that networks with both attributes indeed provide significant advantages in generating unique conceptual combinations.}

abstract = {Creativity is associated with finding novel, surprising, and useful solutions. We argue that creative cognitive processes, divergent thinking, abstraction, and improvisation are constructed on different novelty-based processes. The prefrontal cortex plays a role in creative ideation by providing a control mechanism. Moreover, thinking about novel solutions activates the distant or loosely connected neurons of a semantic network that involves the hippocampus. Novelty can also be interpreted as different combinations of earlier learned processes, such as the motor sequencing mechanism of the basal ganglia. In addition, the cerebellum is responsible for the precise control of movements, which is particularly important in improvisation. Our neurocomputational perspective is based on three creative processes centered on novelty seeking, subserved by the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, basal ganglia, and dopamine. The algorithmic implementation of our model would enable us to describe commonalities and differences between these creative processes based on the proposed neural circuitry. Given that most previous studies have mainly provided theoretical and conceptual models of creativity, this article presents the first brain-inspired neural network model of creative cognition.}

A corpus of 7879 research articles related to spatial perspectives on energy issues is processed and analyzed based on a step-by-step framework for the automated, transparent, and reproducible analysis of large sets of research articles. For this purpose, natural language processing approaches, including named entity recognition and structural topic modeling, are adopted. Based on this large-n selection procedure, selected topics related to the geographical political economy of the energy transition are reviewed in detail. The review maps the geographical scope and scale of the research field, highlights major topics, and shows the distribution of methodological approaches and the role of geographic information systems in this research field. The results show a growing body of literature attentive to socio-spatial variation and the uneven spatiality of energy systems. Nevertheless, uneven geographical distributions of studies with a strong focus on the major industrialized countries and generally only a few comparative cases were also found. In particular, research on the energy transition and renewable energy policy is strongly informed by studies addressing the Global North, limiting the evidence base for other regional contexts from the Global South.}

We review behavioral and neuroscientific work that speaks to how causal structure shapes comprehension of and memory for narratives. We further draw connections between this work and reinforcement learning, highlighting how narratives help link causes to outcomes in complex environments. By incorporating the plausibility of causal connections between classes of actions and outcomes, reinforcement learning models may become more ecologically valid, while simultaneously elucidating the value of narratives.}

We show that within the computational theory of the mind the two problems are insoluble by the physics of the brain. We further show that attempts to solve the problems by the interactions of the systems implementing the computations with an environment (in or outside the brain) must introduce non-physical factors, and therefore fail on physical grounds. We also show that the problems are endemic and pertain to other forms of functional theories of the mind, most notably, causal functionalism. Finally, we propose a physicalist reductive identity theory, which is a generalization of statistical mechanics for all the special sciences, and show that only a theory of this kind can provide physical solutions to the above two problems in computational neuroscience. We conclude that functionalism in the theory of mind must be replaced with a reductive identity theory.

Additionally, it provided a platform for what might be termed a spirited, enduring, and enlightening—albeit occasionally frustrating—rounds of debate on a broad range of questions. Turing, who proved to be much ahead of his time in more ways than one, predicted that it would be possible to develop machines capable of passing the TT in about 50 years time, that is just about now. Perhaps, Turing overestimated the rate of progress of technology, or of transformation of deeply entrenched paradigms of thought; but whatever the reason, his prediction about the feasibility of “thinking machines” is yet to come true in an engineering or in a symbolic-semantic sense. This paper presents a set of reflections on this and other predictions made by Turing and relates them to what has actually transpired in the 50 years since his original paper was published. Contributions of TT to the field of AI are assessed and directions for the future are presented.}

abstract = {Physiological studies have shown that a group of locust’s lobula giant movement detectors (LGMDs) has a diversity of collision selectivity to approaching objects, relatively darker or brighter than their backgrounds in cluttered environments. Such diversity of collision selectivity can serve locusts to escape from attack by natural enemies, and migrate in swarm free of collision. For computational studies, endeavours have been made to realize the diverse selectivity which, however, is still one of the most challenging tasks especially in complex and dynamic real world scenarios. The existing models are mainly formulated as multi-layered neural networks with merely feed-forward information processing, and do not take into account the effect of re-entrant signals in feedback loop, which is an essential regulatory loop for motion perception, yet never been explored in looming perception. In this paper, we inaugurate feedback neural computation for constructing a new LGMD-based model, named F-LGMD to look into the efficacy upon implementing different collision selectivity. Accordingly, the proposed neural network model features both feed-forward processing and feedback loop. The feedback control propagates output signals of parallel ON/OFF channels back into their starting neurons, thus makes part of the feed-forward neural network, i.e. the ON/OFF channels and the feedback loop form an iterative cycle system. Moreover, the feedback control is instantaneous, which leads to the existence of a fixed point whereby the fixed point theorem is applied to rigorously derive valid range of feedback coefficients. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct systematic experiments covering synthetic and natural collision datasets, and also online robotic tests. The experimental results show that the F-LGMD, with a unified network, can fulfil the diverse collision selectivity revealed in physiology, which not only reduces considerably the handcrafted parameters compared to previous studies, but also offers a both efficient and robust scheme for collision perception through feedback neural computation.}

abstract = {This paper introduces a new solution concept for non-cooperative games in normal form with no ties and pure strategies: the Perfectly Transparent Equilibrium. The players are rational in all possible worlds and know each other’s strategies in all possible worlds — which, together, we refer to as Perfect Prediction. The anticipation of a player’s decision by their opponents is counterfactually dependent on the decision, unlike in Nash Equilibria where the decisions are made independently. The equilibrium, when it exists, is unique and is Pareto optimal. This equilibrium is the normal-form counterpart of the Perfect Prediction Equilibrium; the prediction happens “in another room” rather than in the past. The equilibrium can also be seen as a natural extension of Hofstadter’s superrationality to non-symmetric games. Algorithmically, an iterated elimination of non-individually-rational strategy profiles is performed until at most one remains. An equilibrium is a strategy profile that is immune against knowledge of strategies in all possible worlds and rationality in all possible worlds, a stronger concept than common knowledge of rationality but also stronger than common counterfactual belief of rationality. We formalize and contrast the Non-Nashian Decision Theory paradigm, common to this and several other papers, with Causal Decision Theory and Evidential Decision Theory. We define the Perfectly Transparent Equilibrium algorithmically and prove (when it exists) that it is unique, that it is Pareto-optimal, and that it coincides with Hofstadter’s Superrationality on symmetric games. We relate the finding to concepts found in the literature such as Individual Rationality, Rationalizability, Minimax-Rationalizability, Second-Order Nash Equilibria, the Program Equilibrium, the Perfect Prediction Equilibrium, Shiffrin’s Joint-Selfish-Rational Equilibrium, the Stalnaker–Bonanno Equilibrium, the Perfect Cooperation Equilibrium, the Translucent Equilibrium, the Correlated Equilibrium, and Quantum Games. Finally, we specifically discuss inclusion relationships on the special case of symmetric games between Individual Rationality, Minimax-Rationalizability, Superrationality, and the Perfectly Transparent Equilibrium, and contrast them with asymmetric games.}

While it is generally accepted that the normal joint is loaded under compression, the problems and controversies surrounding this view remain unresolved and the disparity in opinion over its treatment continues. Although difficulties in the acquisition of reliable information have undoubtedly contributed to this situation, it is now considered that deficits in neural control and shortcomings in the underlying biomechanical theory and analysis have also played a part, and that a re-assessment from a different perspective could resolve these. Biotensegrity considers the TMJ from this position, where the mandible is suspended within a tensioned network that extends over a much wider anatomical field than is generally recognized and significant motion control is contained within the structure itself. It is an evolutionary-conserved arrangement that enables the system to rapidly respond to changing functional demands and provides a more complete model of joint physiology that can be used to guide further research.}

These models are commonly developed to provide decision-support tools for policymakers who are forced to make difficult decisions in a timely manner. Done properly, these models are able to provide a safe, quick, and cheap solution for this challenge. There are numerous types of mathematical models for epidemiological disease spread and control. However, in order to become applicative tools for decision-making, the modelers of these models are required to overcome three computational challenges: efficiently define the model, develop it as computer software, and fit it into historical data. Performed efficiently, one can use the obtained tool to explore possible scenarios and PIPs. In this paper, we present a critical review of models that extend the Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (SIR) model and explore the efficiency of these models, their software characteristics, and model performance on real-world data. We further provide a guide for epidemiological-mathematical model development and implementation, exploring several modeling approaches and their respective implementation options. Lastly, we outline the current trends, limitations, and opportunities in this field. In particular, we find that the spatial properties of a model play a critical role in its accuracy and ability to explain historical pandemic spread, especially in the context of airborne diseases. Moreover, we show that agent-based simulations are preferable over partial/ordinary differential solvers when considering a highly-realistic pandemic model or focusing on a relatively small population size.}

Now, biological research enters a new era when experiment and theory walk hand in hand. Novel software and specialized hardware became essential to understand experimental data and propose new models. In fact, current petascale computing resources already allow researchers to reach unprecedented levels of simulation throughput to connect in silico and in vitro experiments. The reduction in cost and improved access allowed a large number of research groups to adopt supercomputing resources and techniques. Here, we outline how large-scale computing has evolved to expand decades-old research, spark new research efforts, and continuously connect simulation and observation. For instance, multiple publicly and privately funded groups have dedicated extensive resources to develop artificial intelligence tools for computational biophysics, from accelerating quantum chemistry calculations to proposing protein structure models. Moreover, advances in computer hardware have accelerated data processing from single-molecule experimental observations and simulations of chemical reactions occurring throughout entire cells. The combination of software and hardware has opened the way for exascale computing and the production of the first public exascale supercomputer, Frontier, inaugurated by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 2022. Ultimately, the popularization and development of computational techniques and the training of researchers to use them will only accelerate the diversification of tools and learning resources for future generations.}

We highlight how this framework can specify commonalities and differences in the social psychopathology of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), personality disorders (PD), and major depressive disorder (MDD) and improve treatments on an individual basis. We conjecture that individuals with psychiatric disorders rely on rigid social knowledge representations when learning about others, albeit the nature of their rigidity and the behavioral consequences can greatly differ. While non-clinical cohorts tend to efficiently adapt social knowledge representations to relevant environmental constraints, psychiatric cohorts may rigidly stick to their preconceived notions or overly coarse knowledge representations during learning.}

We address this issue by proposing that neuroticism stems from trait individual differences in activity in brain circuits that govern the nature of self-generated thought (SGT). We argue our theory explains not only the association of neuroticism with threat sensitivity but also the prominence within the neurotic mind of representations of information that are unrelated to the way the world is right now, such as creativity and nonsituational ‘angst’.}

An applicative approach is systematically applied to build a concept-as-process design. Since modern computing considers information processes as the main objects of modeling, the developed design is indeed representative of the semantic processing of information. The nature of concepts – what concepts are – and the constraints that govern the theory of concepts have been, and continue to be, the subject of debate. It is especially interesting to discuss the nature of concepts in connection with the recently established fundamental nature of information processes that are attributable to all phenomena and events occurring in the world around us. The current trend elevates information processes to forms of computing, which can also be implemented through practices, for example, in the form of programming. The deep component is computational models, one way or another expressed by means of mathematics and metamathematics. The main meta-operations used are abstraction and application. Of greatest interest is functional abstraction and application in the form of applying a function to an argument. Despite this “conceptual minimalism”, a rich theory of concepts can be developed. Using this theory, it is possible to focus further discussion not only on the nature of concepts, but also to characterize the position on each of the five important issues that are central to many theories of concepts: (1) ontology of concepts, (2) structure of concepts, (3) empiricism, and nativism about concepts, (4) concepts and natural language, and (5) concepts and conceptual analysis.}

For now, issues such as data accessibility and shortages of AI talent constrain its application for social good. This chapter has grouped use cases into 10 social-impact domains based on taxonomies in use among social-sector organizations. Each use case highlights a type of meaningful problem that can be solved by one or more AI capability. The cost of human suffering, and the value of alleviating it, are impossible to gauge and compare. Nonetheless, employing usage frequency as a proxy, we measure the potential impact of different AI capabilities.}

For the construction worker detection task, a YOLOv7 model trained with synthetic data nearly matched the performance of a model trained with real data: it achieved 71% AP@0.5–0.95 compared to 75% for the real data-trained model. Moreover, the model trained with synthetic data surpassed its real data counterpart in scenarios requiring stricter IoU thresholds, particularly above 85%. Acquiring a sufficient quantity and diverse range of imagery data has been a primary challenge in construction studies that focus on automation and digitization through deep neural networks. BlendCon can significantly contribute to addressing this data scarcity challenge.}

The brains and minds of our human ancestors remain inaccessible for experimental exploration. Therefore, we reconstructed human cognitive evolution by projecting nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratios (ω values) in mammalian phylogeny onto the anatomically modern human (AMH) brain. This atlas retraces human neurogenetic selection and allows imputation of ancestral evolution in task-related functional networks (FNs). Adaptive evolution (high ω values) is associated with excitatory neurons and synaptic function. It shifted from FNs for motor control in anthropoid ancestry (60–41 mya) to attention in ancient hominoids (26–19 mya) and hominids (19–7.4 mya). Selection in FNs for language emerged with an early hominin ancestor (7.4–1.7 mya) and was later accompanied by adaptive evolution in FNs for strategic thinking during recent (0.8 mya–present) speciation of AMHs. This pattern mirrors increasingly complex cognitive demands and suggests that co-selection for language alongside strategic thinking may have separated AMHs from their archaic Denisovan and Neanderthal relatives.}

Here, we reformulate core ethological concepts in explicitly dynamical systems terms for stateful computation. We examine, based on a wealth of recent neural data collected during complex innate behaviors across species, the neural dynamics that determine the temporal structure of internal states. We will also discuss the degree to which the brain can be hierarchically partitioned into nested dynamical systems and the need for a multi-dimensional state-space model of the neuromodulatory system that underlies motivational and affective states.}

Neural networks, simulated annealing, cultural algorithms, ant colony optimization, and evolutionary algorithms are several instances where psychological, physical, and biological theories have influenced the development of computational methods for problem solving. This chapter takes simulation from the social sciences and shows how it can be modified slightly to perform combinatorial optimization. It explains that thinking is a social activity; human culture and cognition are aspects of a single process. A recent simulation of the spread of culture provides insights into the effects of social interaction and gives a starting point for demonstrating that a small number of simple principles can cause an artificial system to behave remarkably like a complex human society. Though all interactions are local, insights and innovations are transported by culture from the originator to distant individuals; moreover, a combination of various innovations results in more improved methods.}

abstract = {Given the large amount of time we spend indoors, designing and operating buildings that are safe, comfortable, and conducive to productivity and well-being is essential. To achieve this goal, in the past decades, research has been conducted to investigate the influence of the indoor environment on occupants. Thermal comfort has been the subject of most investigations in this field. However, despite being a consolidated research topic since the 1920s, statistical practices for analysing thermal comfort data often rely on simplified premises, which may be due to several possible factors (e.g., limited computational capabilities and lack of training). Consequently, important aspects of data analysis are often absent or overlooked. Recent statistics and statistical software advances have provided more options for effectively modelling complex issues. However, properly using these tools requires a solid understanding of statistical analysis, increasing the risk of misuse in practice. This paper presents ten questions highlighting the most critical issues regarding statistical analysis for thermal comfort research and practice. The first four questions provide general perspectives concerning statistical data analysis, while the remaining ones address specific problems related to thermal comfort research, but that can extend to all human-centric research in the built environment. Additionally, the last five questions demonstrate the practical significance of analysis pitfalls (i.e., sampling variability, selection bias, variable selection, clustered/nested observations, and measurement error) through examples with synthetic data. This study provides insights into the current statistical ‘habits’ in thermal comfort research and, more importantly, help researchers better define and conduct their statistical analyses.}

For example, during social interactions, the actions of one person influence the internal states of another. These social dependencies make it difficult to formalize social learning problems in a mathematically tractable way. While it is tempting to dispense with these complexities, they are a defining feature of social life. Because the structure of social interactions challenges the simplifying assumptions often made in models, they make an ideal testbed for computational models of cognition. By adopting a framework that embeds existing social knowledge into the model, we can go beyond explaining behaviors in laboratory tasks to explaining those observed in the wild.}

Challenges that currently exist between computational biology and biological computation were outlined and further discussed for a solution to fill the persistent “wet dry” research gap for a better future. Emerging proper techniques for combining data from several modalities is the foremost challenge in handling single-cell multimodal data. This process has been referred to as “data integration” It includes various strategies, from batch-correcting individual omics datasets to correlating chromatin accessibility to development in virtually all genetic mutations with transcription. In this chapter, we offer solutions for how researchers can overcome challenges to inspire the creation of various computer science algorithms and approaches, as well as how computational methods and mathematical modeling have aided in the comprehension of different biological domains, including computational and stem cell biology. A few current references and examples have been incorporated to explain the emerging concepts in computational biology and address existing problems. They are discussed here with their future aspects, hoping to encourage younger researchers to work in this fascinating field and deal with the challenges mentioned before with a modern approach.}

In this article, we propose six analytical categories to describe qualitative information regarding imaginations about the collective futures. These categories reflect a conceptual integration of normative stances in Science, Technology and Society and capacity approaches to Futures Studies. We translated those analytical categories into grammatical markers that allow for their operationalisation. Using a large-scale participatory process in Chile aimed at systematising images of the future, we utilised Natural Language Process to transform the grammatical markers into computational codes that allowed us to automatically assess large amounts of qualitative data. Ultimately, our main argument is that analytical categories to describe imaginations about collective futures can be generated with reasonable foundations in the humanities and social sciences.}

Thus, this study evaluates a “coding as a playground” experience in keeping with the Positive Technological Development (PTD) framework with the KIBO robotics kit, specially designed for young children. The research was conducted with preschool children aged 3–5 years old (N = 172) from three Spanish early childhood centers with different socio-economic characteristics and teachers of 16 classes. Results confirm that it is possible to start teaching this new literacy very early (at 3 years old). Furthermore, the results show that the strategies used promoted communication, collaboration and creativity in the classroom settings. The teachers also exhibited autonomy and confidence to integrate coding and computational thinking into their formal curricular activities, connecting concepts with art, music and social studies. Through the evidence found in this study, this research contributes with examples of effective strategies to introduce robotics, coding and computational thinking into early childhood classrooms.}

Three distinct and widely used features – Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and Principal components (PCs) extracted from target images are used in a manner which is simple, and yet effective. The HOG and LBP features further undergo Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. Our model uses multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) to classify these three features and fuse them to form a sparsely connected model. A computational theory is first developed by using concepts from the information processing mechanism of the brain. Extensive experiments are carried out using eight publicly available face datasets to validate our proposed model’s performance in recognizing faces with extreme variation of illumination, pose angle, expression, and background. We also investigate the same mechanism because of reasons discussed later, on object recognition tasks as well. Results obtained are extremely promising when compared with other face and object recognition algorithms including CNN and deep learning-based methods. This highlights that simple computational processes, if clubbed properly, can produce competing performance with best algorithms.}

While such integrative curricula are expected in a graduate school setting, they are challenging at the undergraduate level since they require proficiency in multiple disciplines. However, making this transition to interdisciplinary, project-based teaching at the undergraduate level gives a competitive edge to undergraduates. As part of a broader effort of developing a comprehensive neuroscience curriculum, we implemented an interdisciplinary, one-semester, upper-level course called Biophysical Modeling of Excitable Cells (BMEC). The course exposes undergraduate students to broad areas of computational biology. It focuses on computational neuroscience, develops scientific literacy, and promotes teamwork between biology, psychology, physics, and mathematics-oriented undergraduates. This course also provides pedagogical experience for senior Ph.D. students in Neuroscience. BMEC is a three contact hours per week lecture-based course that includes a set of computer-based activities designed to gradually increase the undergraduates’ ability to apply mathematics and computational concepts to solving biologically-relevant problems. The class brings together two different groups of students with very dissimilar and complementary backgrounds, i.e., biology/psychology and physics/mathematics oriented. The teamwork allows students with more substantial biology/psychology backgrounds to explain to physics/mathematics students the biological implications and instill realism into the computer modeling project they completed for this class. Simultaneously, students with substantial physics/mathematics backgrounds can apply techniques learned in specialized mathematics, physics, or computer science classes to generate mathematical hypotheses and implement them in computer codes. This study expands on Oprisan (2021) by including examples of hands-on activities, student projects, and a brief overview of course assessment tools and results.

Concurrently, calls for integrating CT concepts within authentic science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) contexts have also increased. This is reflected by the inclusion of CT in the Next Generation Science Standards and the Standards for Technological and Engineering Literacy. However, methods for teaching CT concepts within secondary level STEM courses vary drastically. Physical computing, the design and programming of physical systems or devices using computational thinking skills, has become increasingly popular in the U.S. in attempts to integrate CT within authentic STEM problem-solving contexts. Despite this rise in popularity, there remains a limited but growing body of research investigating physical computing pedagogy and student learning. A mixed methods design was used in this study to examine 170 middle school students’ attitudes toward coding and after participating in either a screen-based or physical computing unit. The results indicated that students who completed the screen-based unit reported statistically greater attitudes toward the classroom applications and career/future use of computing concepts. Students in the treatment group believed that physical computing made learning computing concepts more difficult, but they preferred the hands-on learning opportunities provided by physical computing. Furthermore, male students reported higher attitudinal ratings than females regarding the influence computing would have on their future academic and career choices. This study provides implications for improving physical computing instruction and integration within STEM education contexts.}

Lack of assessment procedures make it difficult to evaluate the progress made during the implementation of LT. The current study attempts to address this gap by developing and demonstrating an assessment procedure to evaluate the extent of lean implementation in a healthcare institution To begin with, different lean tenets and elements applied in healthcare institutions were identified through a literature review. Following it, a Fuzzy-Logic Input Based Healthcare Institution Lean Implementation Assessment (FLB-HLIA) was developed and deployed in an Indian case hospital to compute “Healthcare Institution’s Lean Implementation Index” (HLII). FLB-HLIA revealed that the case hospital has to focus on two lean tenets, namely establishing pull system, and seeking perfection, to improve its HLII. Assessment also revealed the lean elements that the case hospital can focus to upgrade its HLII. HLII can be used by practitioners to perform intra-benchmarking and inter-benchmarking of healthcare institutions. Results of FLB-HLIA provide a future action plan for the lean implementation journey of the healthcare institution by identifying the possible areas of improvement for future.}

Therefore, in this paper, we establish a framework for IRS-assisted MEC computational offloading to solve this problem and take fairness optimization as a key point involving communication and computing resources. Minimize user consumption by optimizing bandwidth allocation, task offloading ratio, edge computing resources, transmission power and IRS phase shifts. Firstly, we decompose the problem into three aspects, such as bandwidth allocation, computing resource allocation, transmission power and IRS phase shifts. Then, an alternative optimization algorithm is proposed to find the optimum solution and its convergence is proved. Secondly, since the optimization problem on transmission power and IRS phase shifts is non-convex, we propose Riemann gradient descent (R-SGD) algorithm to solve it. Finally, numerical results show that our proposed algorithm performs better than other algorithms and achieves a superiority in the framework.}

The present research provides evidence in favor of the claim that this process is guided by an early-emerging predisposition to think and learn about abstract kinds. Specifically, three studies (N=192) demonstrated that 4- to 7-year-old children have better recall for novel information about kinds (e.g., that dogs catch a bug called “fep”) than for similar information about individuals (e.g., that a particular dog catches a bug called “fep”). By showing that children are particularly likely to retain information about kinds, this work not only provides a first empirical demonstration of a phenomenon that may be key to conceptual development but also makes it apparent that young children’s thinking is suffused with abstractions rather than being perceptually-based and concrete.}

Rural areas are distinctive spaces and places but in the current debates of new digital phenomena, digital spaces and practices risk not being contextualized with sensitivities to rural geographies. This study aims to map how digital has been examined to date in rural-focused studies, and accordingly present propositions for how rural-digital studies can be sensitive to the distinctive and diverse character of rural spaces and places. We conduct a two-stage/scale literature review, combining 1) computational topic modelling from a Global Dataset (459 article abstracts) with 2) qualitative content analysis from a sub-dataset focusing on the Nordic region (Nordic Sub-Dataset, 17 full articles). We begin with a topic modelling analysis generating ten major themes (topics) leading to an overview of how research areas are connected to the meaning of rural context. Turning to the Nordic region, as an in-depth example, we illustrate the complexity of rural digital geographies, through a qualitative content analysis. This demonstrates that digital in rural contexts are primarily positioned outwardly as social/regional development and business/economy, and less situated inwardly through individual experience and community building. Combined we show a wide spectrum of rural-digital relations but demonstrate that rural contexts in rural-digital relations need more attention. We propose three propositions to invite deeper rural contextualizations in future digital studies to uphold the importance of rural spaces and places through, by and with digital geography.}

abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) and sustainable building certification integration have been the focus of several studies in recent years, aiming to create a simpler and more effective building certification process. This paper describes a novel computational tool for architects and engineers, considering that the certification process takes place in a work environment that is familiar to them. The goal is to present a method for developing a computational tool that will automate the process of verifying the achievement of certain Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) credits using visual programming in a BIM environment. In this way, designers can have an insight into the achievement of certain LEED credits at any phase during the design process. Considering the complexity of the digital parameterization of LEED credits, this method includes the achievement of three credits listed in the Material and Resources chapter of the LEED for Building Design and Construction protocol. Apart from similar research, the presented tool enables visibility of real-time LEED credits achievement at every moment of the design, from the building concept development to the final stage. The presented method creates space for the elaboration on the other LEED credits, as well as research in the area of applicability to other green rating certification programs and evaluation of existing building stock.}

abstract = {A content analysis of interviews with an ethnically diverse group of 202 children aged 6 to 10 describes what children think racism is, and examines associations between age, ethnicity, and children's thinking about racism. Children's narratives capture many dimensions of racism, including stereotypes, prejudice, discrimination, and ethnic conflict. With age, children's ideas about racism become more elaborated and differentiated. At every age, compared to their peers, African American children have more elaborated and differentiated ideas about racism and mention those dimensions of racism that overtly reflect power relations more frequently. Qualitative analyses suggest that children's ideas about racism are abstract, increasingly coherent with age, and sometimes incorporate causal language. Findings are discussed in terms of origins of individual differences, the extent to which children's ideas about racism might be considered a lay theory, and the likely consequences of such a theory in daily life.}

Such modules facilitate the study of biological processes by deconstructing complex biological networks into conceptually simple entities. The definition of network modules is often based on intuitive reasoning. As an alternative, methods are being developed for defining biochemical network modules in an unbiased fashion. These unbiased network modules are mathematically derived from the structure of the whole network under consideration.}
