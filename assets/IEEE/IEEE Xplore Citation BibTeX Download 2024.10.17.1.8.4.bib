  abstract={The existing neural networks mainly involve working memory in the memory module, which can basically meet the needs of a neural network at work. However, for human intelligence, working memory is far from meeting the needs, especially in some advanced activities, such as thinking, language and emotion. Based on the concept driven processing theory, that is, the top-down processing mode of human perception, and the dualprocess theory of attention, that is, automatic processing and control processing based on the cognitive resource theory, this paper puts forward the computer neural network long-term memory storage model and the computer neural network dualprocess model, in order to construct the long-term memory of computer neural network, reduce the loss of computing time and computing resources, and improve the processing rate of information. It provides the possibility for the realization of neural network in automatic processing, subconscious judgment and other activities, as well as high-level activities such as self-control, strategy formulation and organization planning.},

  abstract={When it comes to scene classification, the lack of labelled data is a significant obstacle that forces researchers to think about innovative solutions. This work presents a revolutionary method to strengthen scene classification models by combining transfer learning with AI-generated images. A key component of this project is the construction of a carefully curated dataset of 3672 augmented AI-generated photos in a total of 6 scenes. This database not only serves as a helpful resource for additional research but also makes a substantial contribution to this area of research. Using this dataset, a VGG16 model is trained, demonstrating the usefulness of synthetic data with a notable increase in accuracy. The model's performance is further improved through subsequent training using realistic photos through transfer learning, thereby surpassing the initial baseline. This work demonstrates the transformative effect of transfer learning on scene categorization accuracy and verifies its effectiveness using synthetic data through rigorous testing and evaluation. The results open the door for AI-generated photos to be used as an effective approach to address data scarcity issues in scene classification, which will help real-world applications improve.},

  abstract={Floods cause havoc in many regions of India every year during the monsoon season. However, commuters really do not really think of the after effects caused by the floods. Commuting during water-logging is risky because the depth of logged water cannot be determined. This can lead to cars and bikes getting stuck inside the flooded zone. Thus travelling through such areas can lead to loss of life. Our paper focuses on the classification of floodwater depth. We propose a deep-learning model that classifies the depth of the flood water level into different categories according to the depth. In this paper, we have used the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the images given as an input by the user/commuter. For better user accessibility we propose to integrate the model with a cross-platform app that would be convenient for the commuters; along with an in-app alert system, which notifies other users about the location where the water level is above threshold value.},

  abstract={Machine learning models have achieved significant milestones in various domains, for example, computer vision models have an exceptional result in object recognition, and in natural language processing, where Large Language Models (LLM) like GPT can start a conversation with human-like proficiency. However, abstract reasoning remains a challenge for these models, “Can AI really thinking like a human?” still be a question yet to be answered. Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) is a metric designed to assess human reasoning capabilities. It presents a series of eight images as a problem set, where the participant should try to discover the underlying rules among these images and select the most appropriate image from eight possible options that best completes the sequence. This task always be used to test human reasoning abilities and IQ. Zhang et al proposed a dataset called RAVEN [12] which can be used to test Machine Learning model abstract reasoning ability. In this paper, we purposed Vision Transformer Contrastive Network which build on previous work with the Contrastive Perceptual Inference network (CoPiNet), which set a new benchmark for permutation-invariant models Raven's Progressive Matrices by incorporating “contrast effects” from psychology, cognition, and education, and extends this foundation by leveraging the cutting-edge Vision Transformer architecture. This integration aims to further refine the machine's ability to process and reason about spatial-temporal information from pixel-level inputs and global wise features on RAVEN dataset.},

  pages={790-795},
  abstract={Corrosion of the welded joint has been singled out as a main cause of damage to ships. Insufficient maintenance of ships causes severe accidents due to the deterioration of products. These accidents lead to serious problems ranging from environmental pollution caused by oil spills to loss of lives. In order to prevent such accidents, we should design the product's life cycle before designing the product, evaluate the life of the product, and make effective maintenance plans by computer simulation. Additionally, we should think of realizing the best product design front the viewpoint of life-cycle management. This paper presents a welded joint model that considers the effect of corrosion of the welded joint of a ship structure and presents a scenario for the collapse of a ship. In addition, a simulation method for evaluating product deterioration by corrosion of the welded joint is shown. In order to support a life-cycle design that takes corrosion into account, the authors have implemented a life-cycle simulation system based on a product model for computer-aided design and production.},

Classroom activities presented in this paper provide a first approach to a widely used engineering model, such as “two-pole network”. The didactic proposal aims to develop solving skills for pencil and paper problems, for assembling and measuring circuits with real components, for reverse engineer of assembled circuit and allows the incorporation of some design elements. The experiences are presented on a basic technology class of first year of engineer career, in which different configuration of black boxes with four accessible test points are used as two-pole network. Student interest is observed in class as they get actively involved in learning of circuits. Thus development possibilities of thinking skills get opened, such as analyzing, predicting, evaluating, among others. From perception, the Incorporation of experiential knowledge is facilitated. This open the way to a theoretical knowledge with a higher degree of abstraction. Once the student has measured, interpreted, proposed alternative models, and has contrasted models with specific configuration, he will have some conceptual tools to address more complex systems.},

To complete the experience, multimedia software is being developed. The software is intended to support the students' knowledge construction by presenting them with new situations that could take place, helping them to think up different points of view, while promoting interaction with the teachers, with each other, and with their books and papers.

  abstract={With the development of computer technology, people’s thinking mode has also changed dramatically. 3D animation and virtual reality (VR) technology can be seen everywhere around people. With the development of technology, 3D animation and VR technology are applied in more and more fields, such as education, medical treatment and commerce. Under the background of increasing international competition, the update speed of high-tech is changing with each passing day. With the wide application of VR technology by modern people, the 3D animation industry has been further developed. The effective combination of 3D animation scene graphic design and VR technology can further improve the overall perfection of 3D animation scene design. This paper improves the lighting model and shadow rendering algorithm according to the defects of the general lighting rendering algorithm in the application of 3D animation scenes. Based on this, a hybrid 3D scene lighting rendering algorithm is obtained. When optimizing the Cook Torrance lighting model, a geometric attenuation factor algorithm is used, and when improving the shadow rendering algorithm, a light shadow rendering algorithm based on variance shadow is used.},

However the true potential and benefits of these systems are yet to be realized. Significant benefits will be realized when instructional technologies are systematically incorporated into a system of tools that support ongoing thinking and learning activities. This paper discusses one such effort, "Anchored Learning Environments" (ALE), an emerging architecture for integrated curricula instruction and learning. ALE extend well-developed theories of educational practice into the domain of interactive computer-assisted instruction. The resulting computer-supported environments facilitate sustained learning by active learners. A major goal of the ALE architecture is to help students understand the kinds of problems and opportunities that exist in complex, real world environments. A related goal is to help students integrate their knowledge through the repeated exploration of the same situation (macrocontext) from multiple points of view. This paper discusses a series of relates ALE spanning the disciplines of mathematics, physics, history, and geography. The research described provides a blueprint for an interactive teaching program that bridges multiple departments, introducing students, educators, and faculty to the possibilities of technology-supported integrated curricula learning.},

  abstract={There are more and more electromagnetic compatibility problems contributing to safety related errors, malfunctions and other failures in Chinese High Speed Railway. However, the classical EMC test and theory does not take into account risk analysis of EMC especially in safety critical systems. In order to help engineers to solve the EMC problems systematically, a method with risk assessment and management thinking is used in this paper. First the study proposes an EMC Risk Analysis Model (EMCRAM) based on the Hierarchical Holographic Modeling (HHM) with four levels. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is introduced to calculate the risk of EMC faults when the risk value of the indices is obtained with the method of EMC measurement and experts' knowledge and experience. To demonstrate the approach, it is validated by an application of railway signal system and the results show the EMC risk and vulnerability in the railway signal system.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={This paper affords a hybrid forecasting scheme for time series prediction in head-primarily based aggregation clusters. The proposed version combines multiple individual predictors in a manner that permits each to capture heterogeneous characteristics of the time series and think of each of the temporal and spatial dimensions within the enter statistics. An aggregation step is also included to construct cluster distributions to enhance prediction accuracy. The model's performance is evaluated on actual datasets with recognition of each temporal and spatial dimension. Results display the effectiveness of the proposed technique in predicting destiny values of time collection with accuracy higher than individual predictions. Further, the model also can cope with minor adjustments within the shape of facts, allowing for excessive flexibility within the analysis and forecasting procedure. It explores the ability of hybrid predictions of time collection in head-based total aggregation clusters. It provides a complete time collection evaluation, forecasting the usage of an aggregate of records mining and device-getting-to-know techniques. The paper introduces the vital standards and techniques for an adequate time series forecasting version. A hybrid prediction model consisting of the Autoregressive included shifting standard (ARIMA) model and the Weighted Neighbourhood common (WNA) model is then explored. The efficacy of the version is statistically tested on an artificial dataset with constant natural and seasonal time series additives and on one actual-global dataset with a vast range of correlated time collection. Compared to classic forecasting fashions, the effects demonstrate that a hybrid prediction version produces drastically higher accuracy and offers an extra sensible representation of the device's behavior. The paper evaluates hybrid prediction fashions to alternative strategies and a few viable future development directions.},

We describe the environment representation model used, the Stixel World, and its benefits for compact scene representation. We show our preliminary results of its application in a diverse environment and the limitations reached in our experiments using imaging systems. We argue that this method has been developed in an ideal scenario and does not generalise well to uncommon changes in the environment. We also found that this method is sensitive to the quality of the stereo rectification and the calibration of the optics, among other parameters, which makes it time-consuming and delicate to prepare in real-time applications. We think that pixel-wise semantic segmentation techniques can address some of the shortcomings of the concept presented in a theoretical discussion.},

It presents some of the key concepts and tools as a summary: trustor/trustee separation, trust relationship description, virtualisation and trust, and trust domains. The flip side of thinking about the trust relationships that one system will form to other systems is for architect to consider the place of the system as a trustee: the recipient or target of those trust relationships. A key point is that the architect of trustee system should aim to have a good understanding of not only the functional uses to which the system may be put but also the trust contexts and risk concerns of potential trustors. Trust and risk lurk in all areas of the field of computing, from the smallest IoT device to the largest supercomputer, from wind turbines to online gaming, and from financial markets to educational institutions.},

  abstract={Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder that affects a person's ability to think, feel, and behave clearly. Schizophrenia detection using Electroencephalography is an en-grossing area of neuroscience. There are several researches reported on designing effective models which can detect schizophre-nia accurately, however, existing models are either complex or use an extensive number of waves to process for detecting schizophre-nia accurately. Addressing the issues mentioned above, this work presents a lightweight Schizophrenia detection model with the help of Gamma wave extraction from the electroencephalogram brain waves. The proposed model has approximately 12500 parameters with an accuracy of 99.5 % which is much lighter than the previous state-of-the-art models that contain nearly 11 million parameters. We also presented a detailed comparative result analysis among all the state-of-the-art models with the proposed model which shows the effectiveness of our proposed model.},

Specifically, due to the high dimensions and linear correlation of the auxiliary information, this paper uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension to improve the predictive accuracy. In addition, Pearson correlation is better than the Euclidean distance as the similarity measurement to predict accuracy of preference value through the analysis of the different experimental results. Experimental results on real-world data sets demonstrate that the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract={Nowadays, enterprises survive in a competitive environment. Logistics is looked as “the third profit source” which has big potential in reducing the cost of operations. Especially inventory and transportation occupy a considerable proportion in logistics cost. So reduce the cost becomes the key to reduce it. However, China's enterprises consider how to reduce transport cost or inventory cost only, ignoring the relation between the two parts, making the logistics systemic operating cost high. The paper takes full consideration of antinomies of transportation and inventory cost and use systemic thinking to low the operating cost in order to provide a solution to the two costs.},

  abstract={For the coding bit-rate control problem on the H.264 wireless video communication, on the basis of in-depth rate-distortion theory analysis, this paper researches current common rate distortion computation model, establish the relationship between the total distortion statistics measurement, the coding bit-rate measurement, the quantization parameter and the macro block intra frame refresh rate, and put forward new associated error control and code-rate control thinking. This method not only can acquire the optimal control point in the rate-distortion curve from the global perspective under the code error environment, but also can self-adaptive adjust the bit allocation and the quantization parameter under given network bandwidth. Furthermore, it can also implement intra frame macro block refresh at the same time and play important role in counteracting the channel code error to minimize the total distortion under certain bit-rated according to current network package loss probability, by which to establish the rate-distortion model of associated signal source channel and apply the rate-distortion optimized solution method to optimal allocate the bit-rate between the signal source coding and the channel coding. This method can provide valuable reference for the video robust coding transmission and resource allocation under the wireless environment.},

  abstract={when faculty in university visualize the students' personal information, they usually focus on the current view, losing trace of the historical views, which results in missing of some important information or patterns. To address this problem and figure out the unknowns hidden in educational datasets, this paper proposes the historical views navigation though similarity and closeness centrality based recommendation. In this approach, the useful intermediate views or the views interested by users are saved as history and compared with the current view. By analyzing the similarity between them and the closeness centrality measure, the most relative historical views are recommended to the user. Finally, the user study shows that most of the participants are interested in our work. They think it's helpful and will continue to use it.},

  abstract={Maize crops get hit hard by corn rust, a big disease that affects farming all over the world's food production. Traditional ways of finding diseases and putting them in groups are basic, but often limited by what people think about it. They don't work well when needed for a large number of cases. This study shows a new method using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which is deep learning (DL). It helps to correctly identify the degree of damage from corn rust disease. The study shows that the MLP model works well in finding and classifying disease stages using a set of 3500 and pictures from six levels. The MLP model was carefully made and taught to recognize small changes in disease levels. It puts importance on being right, exact, and remembering everything about it all the time. The machine reached 94.20% accuracy, showing it could be useful for people working with plants and those who farm. The MLP was faster, more scalable, and gave better results than other computer learning methods. It did a great job! This study aids the increasing mix of artificial intelligence and farming that's precise. It shows how DL can help solve tough agriculture problems. The results show that the MLP model can help manage crop diseases. It helps in quick and effective actions to stop these problems from causing more harm. For the future, we want to make the model stronger. We also plan on using it for other sicknesses and adding it to farming systems that check things in real-time right away. The research opens the door for better farming methods that are both green and save energy, driven by smart machines.},
