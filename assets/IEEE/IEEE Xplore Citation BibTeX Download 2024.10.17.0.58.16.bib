  title={The Concept of Sense in the Aspect of the Theory of Algorithms}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={51-55},
  abstract={The article refers to interdisciplinary scientific research in philosophy, information theory and the theory of algorithms. This article presents the results of theoretical studies on the formalization of human intellectual activity in relation to the field of cognitive sciences. The subject of the study is the concept of sense. The relevance of the study is conditioned by the development of artificial intelligence, in which the category of sense plays one of the leading roles. For humans, the concept of sense is relevant, both from a world outlook point of view and from the standpoint of cognitive science. However, the problem lies in the fact that sense is an axiomatic concept and therefore is difficult to formalize. There are various formulations of the sense at a qualitative level, but to solve practical problems in the field of cognitive science, a quantitative definition is required, that is, a description of the sense from a mathematical standpoint. The purpose of the study is to mathematically substantiate the concept of sense using the theory of algorithms and, as a consequence, to prove the possibility of calculating the sense. This paper uses the philosophical concept of the relationship of participation (author S. E. Yachin) and the Kolmogorov Complexity of Algorithms (author A. N. Kolmogorov). The principle of relativization, laid down in the formulation of the relationship of participation, served as the foundation for the development of an algorithmic approach to the calculation of sense. At a hypothetical level, an assumption is made that the additive constant accompanying the algorithmic calculations of information can serve as a measure of the amount of sense. To confirm the proposed hypothesis, a theorem on the computability of sense has been formulated and proved. The results obtained may be of interest to researchers and developers of artificial intelligence and other areas of cognitive science.},

  abstract={It is necessary to develop students to become lifelong learning of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to meet the challenges in the 21st century. Therefore, the STEM research center of Universitas Syiah Kuala in collaboration with other stakeholders in education, namely government, industry, public, and media has launched the Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Character (STEMC) learning approach. There are six aspects to be developed through the STEMC approach: critical thinking, creativity, communication, collaboration, computational thinking, and characters. In general, the nature of STEMC is not only a process of transferring knowledge from teachers to students but also an effort to build students' character. STEMC approach is designed to improve students' scientific abilities, motivation, and perseverance. It means that every phase of learning is designing to support students' intellectual and emotional growth. This paper aims to address what has been done at the STEM Research Center of Universitas Syiah Kuala and the plan for integrating STEMC in Indonesia. It provides an overview of some projects that have been conducted, such as the development of STEMC modules for senior high schools and collaboration with State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in teacher professional development programs. In addition, this paper also highlights the STEM center's plan to implement STEMC in Indonesia},

  year={2023},
  volume={},

  abstract={This paper explores the intersection of historical exploration, gamification, and immersive technologies to enhance engagement and learning in history education. Traditional methods of historical inquiry often struggle to captivate learners' interest, particularly in an era dominated by digital experiences. Gamification, incorporating game elements into non-game contexts, has shown promise in fostering engagement and motivation. This study delves into the potential benefits of leveraging immersive gamification to create dynamic and captivating historical exploration experiences. The theoretical framework draws upon educational theories, game design principles, and the evolving landscape of immersive technologies such as virtual reality and augmented reality. We examine the limitations of traditional historical education methods and discuss how gamification can address these challenges by providing interactive and participatory learning experiences. Furthermore, the paper outlines fundamental design principles for creating immersive historical exploration scenarios, emphasising the importance of narrative structure, game mechanics, and user engagement. Through case studies, we highlight successful applications of immersive gamification in historical education, presenting outcomes and insights gained from these implementations. Challenges and considerations in integrating immersive gamification into historical exploration are also explored, including ethical considerations and accessibility issues. The paper concludes by proposing future directions for research in this emerging field, anticipating the continued evolution of technologies and pedagogical approaches.},

  abstract={Perhaps the easiest way to present the central theme of this article is to ask the following thought question: "how many people would it take to destroy the world?" By "world" in this context, I am referring to humankind. Destroying the world has been a recurring theme in novels and movies for many years. The end of the world is also an element of many religions. However, until this century there was no real belief that mankind could destroy itself. So, for most of human pre-history and history, destruction of the human race would only have been remotely possible through mass murder/suicide. This was hardly a likely prospect. In the 1800's mechanized warfare and massive production and transport of weapons and supplies became possible. This increased the destructive potential of war, but still did not make it a likely mechanism for global self-destruction. It was only in the 1940s and 1950s that we have achieved the means to destroy the world, with the development and massive production of nuclear weapons. However, developing this capability required a very large technological effort, which only resided in the hands of the large governments. Tens of thousands of people, supported by economies of tens of millions, were required to produce this capability.},

  abstract={Visualizations are nowadays appearing in popular media and are used everyday in the workplace. This democratisation of visualization challenges educators to develop effective learning strategies, in order to train the next generation of creative visualization specialists. There is high demand for skilled individuals who can analyse a problem, consider alternative designs, develop new visualizations, and be creative and innovative. Our three-stage framework, leads the learner through a series of tasks, each designed to develop different skills necessary for coming up with creative, innovative, effective, and purposeful visualizations. For that, we get the learners to create an explanatory visualization of an algorithm of their choice. By making an algorithm choice, and by following an active-learning and project-based strategy, the learners take ownership of a particular visualization challenge. They become enthusiastic to develop good results and learn different creative skills on their learning journey.},

  abstract={We have been exploring a variety of computerized techniques for analyzing student writing in introductory biology. We achieve computer-to-expert inter-rater reliability (IRR) on par with expert-to-expert IRR (> .8). In Fall, 2012, we piloted the use of automated text analysis to facilitate the use of written formative assessment for Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT) in a large-enrollment introductory biology course at a large public Midwestern university. A total of 12,677 student responses to 15 online homework questions were collected in three 300+ student course sections with four instructors. We used automated analysis to create feedback for instructors before the next class period (less than one working day), so that instructions could use this feedback to inform their instruction. Instructors used many of the questions pre- and post-instruction and the reports we provided to them allowed them to see how their students' answers changed as a result of their instruction. Focus groups with the instructors revealed that they already knew some of the topics that challenged students, as revealed in previous semesters with multiple-choice examinations. However, the instructors pointed out that the written assessments were particularly important for gaining insight as to why students have struggled continuously with these ideas.},

  abstract={The article proposes an canvas-oriented approach to game design. It justifies the applying of a dynamic cycle of interconnected canvases into creative game design, for the purpose of documenting the progress and results of the creative process, stimulating it while canvases simultaneously are both clues and guides in game development. The author's definition of game design canvasation as a process of creation of a visual abstract structure that generalizes the case goal (the task containing the accumulated experience) for achieving it and creating a unique creative product is given. Projects “Canvas of Player Psychotypes & Aethteticts”, “Canvas of Player's needs in Control, Information and Action”, “Canvas of Game Mechanics & Dynamics”, “Canvas of Narrative”, “Canvas of the Game World”, “Canvas of Game Level” “Canvas of Ethical Dilemma” are presented. Canvases structure the game development process, reduce the time taken to generate game designer ideas and to contrive game mechanic and dynamics. Canvases are an additional road map toward making creative decisions in game design. They can be a convenient basis for automating the process of latter, a paper prototype of the game and the game design as a quest process provided that each canvas is a location with quest tasks, the variability of which depends on the potential and attitude of the leader and team. Subsequently, it is planned to develop algorithm for routing the components of the canvases also will be developed, allowing to automate the process of filling out sections of the Game Design Document.},

  abstract={Hepatitis C virus is a massive health issue affecting significant portions of the world's population. Applying data preprocessing, feature reduction techniques, and generating rules based on the selected features for classification tasks are considered as important steps in the knowledge discovery in databases. This paper highlights a Rough-Granular Neural Networks model that incorporates Rough Sets and Artificial Neural Networks to make efficient data analysis and suggestive predictions. The Rough Sets is used as a powerful analysis tool for data pre-processing. It is used to reduce and choose the most relevant attributes for reducing the number of input vector to Artificial Neural Networks without reducing the basic knowledge of the information system. This is done to increase Classification accuracy of the proposed model. Resulting optimal data set is input to constructed neural network with supervised learning algorithm for classifying studied cases for testing new medication for HCV treatment. The experimental results show that the overall classification accuracy offered by the proposed model is a superlative result.},

In order to ensure the feasibility of scheduling algorithms in highly dynamic environment, this paper presents agent-based rescheduling negotiation mechanisms with five dynamic disturbances, and verifies its feasibility through simulations. A multi-agent system structure with quick responses and simple communication networks is designed according to characteristics of hybrid flow shops, with which the processing of jobs can be easily traced back.},

  abstract={Creativity becomes an ever important feature in software development nowadays as software application in various domains is on an ever rapid growth. It leads to changes on system requirements, hoping to improve systems with attractive creativity features. Consequently, creative computing is aroused as an emerging research field in software engineering. Currently, there are researches working on approaches and processes to develop creative software from scratch. However, evolving existing systems can achieve the same purpose, though it is hard to add creativity features to legacy systems by traditional software evolution approaches. Obviously, based on experiences over decades from software community, development from scratch might cause a waste in terms of resources. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a Model Driven Architecture based reverse engineering method for creative evolution. Abstraction techniques are explored, classified, designed and applied in this proposed approach. Meanwhile, details and roles of abstraction techniques were developed for each step. Also, an e-learning system is chosen as a case study to illustrate, validate and evaluate the proposed method. Overall, our work aims to contribute to software evolution methodology and its application creatively.},

This research aims at detecting a method for heritage tourism routine design by using a graphical probability model and graphical database theory. Graphical probability is applied to achieved nodes and vertexes' definition of weights. The graphical database is used for connecting nodes with vertexes and establishing models for target heritage area (potential tourism area). Probability calculation is applied to calculate the weights of each connection. Eventually, the graphical probability model can be used to apply the most valuable routines for users to select when visitors arrive in this unfamiliar tourism area. Creative computing methods are used to achieve knowledge combinations and interdisciplinary methods integration, which are the cardinal parts for applying the graphical model in the heritage area.},

Implemented in a design-project-based class, 37 students' perceptions and engagement were evaluated using the Instructional Materials Motivation Survey. Results indicate positive feedback, high engagement levels, and increased comprehension of HCD. Analysis of design reports reveals a more diverse application of HCD, particularly among higher-performing students, indicating the IDRT's influence on intrinsic motivation. However, challenges were identified among lower-performing students, indicating the need for further research to enhance engagement. Overall, the study underscores the potential of MML as a viable instruction method to influence students' motivation and proficiency positively and to scaffold the T&L of HCD.},

  abstract={A lack of early exposure to computer science and a shortage of role models are known barriers hindering underrep-resented students' pursuit and success in the field. Consistent research indicates that students lacking early exposure tend to avoid college-level computer science courses and frequently underperform compared to peers with prior experience. In response, we've created a two-week computer science camp tailored for upper elementary and middle school students from rural and low-income backgrounds. The camp adapts computer science concepts to diverse cultures, challenges stereotypes, and showcases the diverse backgrounds of computer scientists. This paper outlines the camp's design, shares experiences from 40 participating students, and highlights engaging lessons that in-corporate technologies such as Sphero Bolt, Sphero Rover, Tello Drones, Lego Spike Prime, and Scratch. We also gather data on students' favorite activities to understand their interests. Our discussion covers effective strategies for participant recruitment, community trust-building, professional development facilitation, camp activity organization, and project promotion. By sharing challenges and lessons learned, we aim to assist fellow researchers and educators in similar initiatives, fostering collaboration and progress in the field of computer science education.},

  abstract={Teknologi Quran International is a startup company that runs on the education of Islam religion especially in Al-Qur’an recitation. Since this company was founded in 2015, there has been no significant profit from applications that can sponsor the operational cost of the company. This then led to the unfocused development of the Learn Quran Tajwid application because most of the employees now have other external projects outside the company. Therefore, the evaluation of the business model is provided to suggest the monetization model so that the company can gain more profit on its side. The challenged-based learning (CBL) methodology is conducted through qualitative data collection with contextual interviews in order to assess the learning theory which has been implemented and finding the perfect in-app purchasing as well as an organic marketing technique that wants to be implemented in the future. The application that is examined by 20 most convenient user samples and stakeholder’s recommended domain or subject expert, is available on both platforms, Android, and iOS. The evaluation results show that the monetization model of Learn Quran Tajwid needs to be improved completely since right now there are so many possibilities from the active users who have an opportunity to be taken advantage of by the company. This research can also give benefits to a startup company that wants to have a combination of more sustainable monetization models.},

  abstract={Affective interaction with virtual humans can enhance the quality of user experience in virtual reality. It takes place through various considerations such as emotional representation in their behavioral patterns, facial expressions, head pose, body stance, and so on. Deciding on the emotional state of a virtual human at a moment, however, is still a challenge. Computational models of emotion, stemming from appraisal theories, are suggested for modeling emotion in virtual agents. Despite their competence in extracting emotion from appraisal values, they are poorly defined in describing how to assess appraisal values within a sense-think-act behavior model. Motivated by this lack of empirical knowledge on the appraisal stage, in this preliminary work, we propose a framework to bridge the gap between a computational model of emotion and a behavior model of virtual humans. To this end, we use a need-based, goal- oriented, autonomous behavior model to generate salient stimuli for eliciting emotions. Our simulation of a case study suggests that the proposed framework can produce sensible emotional states that conform to the essential principles of appraisal-based emotion theories.},

  abstract={Neuroscience is a highly interdisciplinary field, but more collaboration among STEM disciplines is needed to advance undergraduate neuroscience education. This paper reports the development of code-based virtual laboratories to cross-foster ideas from engineering and biology in the neuroscience classroom. The simulations use a combination of NEURON and Python code to model neurophysiological processes. We report that the use of computational tools in the classroom increases student self-reported comfort in participating in a computational research project. The tools we developed have potential to increase persistence and retention of undergraduate students by encouraging interdisciplinary thinking and reducing barriers to entry.},

  abstract={The programming language Python is simple and easy to learn and is used for students with no prior background in programming. Several colleges and universities teach Python to students who are learning a programming language for the first time. In this paper, we present a curricular model for introducing, through active learning strategies, data analytics concepts and applications into an introductory computer science course for non-majors. We have designed the course to use a variety of hands-on laboratory projects that use the Python programming language and associated tools. While introducing students to an important research area, we believe the use of these projects improves students’ learning experiences, enables them to apply and relate fundamental computational thinking concepts of algorithmic reasoning, data representation, and computational efficiency to data analytics problems. Assessment results show that introducing data analytics concepts and applications through active learning strategies enhanced students’ computing capability to solve problems.},
