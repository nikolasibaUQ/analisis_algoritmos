  abstract={Understanding how proposed medical devices will interface with humans is a major challenge that impacts both the design of innovative new devices and approval and regulation of existing devices. Today, designing and manufacturing medical devices requires extensive and expensive product cycles. Bench tests and other preliminary analyses are used to understand the range of anatomical conditions, and animal and clinical trials are used to understand the impact of design decisions upon actual device success. Unfortunately, some scenarios are impossible to replicate on the bench, and competitive pressures often accelerate initiation of animal trials without sufficient understanding of parameter selections. We believe that these limitations can be overcome through advancements in data-driven and simulation-based medical device design and manufacturing, a research topic that draws upon and combines emerging work in the areas of Regulatory Science and Big Data. We propose a cross-disciplinary grand challenge to develop and holistically apply new thinking and techniques in these areas to medical devices in order to improve and accelerate medical device innovation.},

  pages={749-753},
  abstract={In Norway, a health reform was recently adopted to improve continuity of care. Services that were carried out in hospitals were transferred to municipalities. Small and medium size municipalities have established inter-municipal cooperation to provide specialized services across borders. The research project eHealth-extended Care Coordination studied the inter-municipal cooperation for assessment of dementia, identifying a need for improved communication and coordination. This paper presents the development process of a collaborative information system for dementia assessment using a user-centered design approach. Mixed methods, such as observations, semi-structured interviews and questionnaire, were used for data collection. The results showed that end-user involvement usefully informed the development. The information system effectively supported collaborative work and shared access to information for the inter-municipal team.},

  abstract={Mixing of particles by chaotic flow fields was simulated on the Connection Machine. Each cell was assigned to the processor, and the coordinates of particles residing on the cell were kept in the local memory of the processor. This approach implies the exchange between the local memories, when a particle moves from one cell to another. Approximately 10/sup 5/ particles were injected into a time-dependent flow field obtained by solving the nonlinear system of partial differential equations describing turbulent thermal convection. The flow field was calculated on a CRAY, and data were transferred to a CM-200 through a high-speed HIPPI channel.<>},

  abstract={Industry placements have been lauded as providing benefits to students, industry and academia. While semester-long placements that require a break from study are reported as the most effective, not all students want to extend their course. Short-term placements can also have positive outcomes for student employability, industry skilled-worker supply and enhancement of curriculum. Assessment of student performance though is challenging, as their focus during the placement needs to be on completing tasks for a sponsor. This paper is a case study of a successful short-term placement program used to identify the important factors and components of an assessment scheme for a short-term placement.},

  abstract={Project Jupyter is an open-source project for interactive computing widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing. We argue that even though Jupyter helps users perform complex, technical work, Jupyter itself solves problems that are fundamentally human in nature. Namely, Jupyter helps humans to think and tell stories with code and data. We illustrate this by describing three dimensions of Jupyter: 1) interactive computing; 2) computational narratives; and 3) the idea that Jupyter is more than software. We illustrate the impact of these dimensions on a community of practice in earth and climate science.},

  abstract={Processes are everywhere. Organizations have business processes to manufacture products, provide services, purchase goods, handle applications, etc. Also in our daily lives we are involved in a variety of processes, for example when we use our car or when we book a trip via the Internet. Although such operational processes are omnipresent, they are at the same time intangible. Unlike a product or a piece of data, processes are less concrete because of their dynamic nature. However, more and more information about these processes is captured in the form of event logs. Contemporary systems ranging from copiers and medical devices to enterprise information systems and cloud infrastructures record events. These events can be used to make processes visible. Using process mining techniques it is possible to discover processes. This provides the insights necessary to manage, control, and improve processes. Process mining has been successfully applied in a variety of domains ranging from healthcare and e-business to high-tech systems and auditing. Despite these successes, there are still many challenges as process discovery shows that the real processes are more "spaghetti-like" than people like to think. It is still very difficult to capture the complex reality in a suitable model. Given the nature of these challenges, techniques originating from Computational Intelligence may assist in the discovery of complex processes.},

  year={2021},
  volume={18},
  number={1},
  pages={250-260},
  abstract={Biological regulatory networks depend upon chemical interactions to process information. Engineering such molecular computing systems is a major challenge for synthetic biology and related fields. The chemical reaction network (CRN) model idealizes chemical interactions, allowing rigorous reasoning about the computational power of chemical kinetics. Here we focus on function computation with CRNs, where we think of the initial concentrations of some species as the input and the equilibrium concentration of another species as the output. Specifically, we are concerned with CRNs that are rate-independent (the computation must be correct independent of the reaction rate law) and composable ($f\circ g$fâg can be computed by concatenating the CRNs computing $f$f and $g$g). Rate independence and composability are important engineering desiderata, permitting implementations that violate mass-action kinetics, or even âwell-mixednessâ, and allowing the systematic construction of complex computation via modular design. We show that to construct composable rate-independent CRNs, it is necessary and sufficient to ensure that the output species of a module is not a reactant in any reaction within the module. We then exactly characterize the functions computable by such CRNs as superadditive, positive-continuous, and piecewise rational linear. Thus composability severely limits rate-independent computation unless more sophisticated input/output encodings are used.},

  title={Optimal Satellite Formation Reconfiguration Based on Closed-Loop Brain Storm Optimization}, 
  year={2013},
  volume={8},
  number={4},
  pages={39-51},
  abstract={In recent years, satellite formation flying has become an increasingly hot topic for both the astronomy and earth science communities due to its potential merits compared with a single monolithic spacecraft system. This paper proposes a novel approach based on closed-loop brain storm optimization (CLBSO) algorithms to address the optimal formation reconfiguration of multiple satellites using two-impulse control. The optimal satellite formation reconfiguration is formulated as an optimization problem with the constraints of overall fuel cost minimization, final configuration, and collision avoidance. Three versions of CLBSOs are developed by replacing the creating operator in basic brain storm optimization (BSO) with closed-loop strategies, which facilitate search characteristic capture and enhance the optimization performance by taking advantage of feedback information in the search process. Numerical simulations are carried out using particle swarm optimization (PSO), basic BSO, and the three versions of CLBSOs. Comparison results show that all versions of CLBSOs outperform PSO and the original BSO in terms of final results and convergence speed. In addition, CLBSO reduces the computation burden and shortens CPU time to a certain extent in contrast with basic BSO. Furthermore, among the three CLBSO algorithms, the one using the strategy of difference with the best gains the best overall performance, which is inspired by the updating rule in PSO that each particle tends to move towards the individual with the best fitness.},

  abstract={The knowledge instinct is a fundamental mechanism of the mind that drives evolution of higher cognitive functions. Neural modeling fields and dynamic logic describe it mathematically and relate to language, concepts, emotions, and behavior. Perception and cognition, consciousness and unconsciousness, are described, while overcoming past mathematical difficulties of modeling intelligence. The two main aspects of the knowledge instinct determining evolution are differentiation and synthesis. Differentiation proceeds from and unconscious states to more crisp and conscious, from less knowledge to more knowledge; it separates concepts from emotions, Its main mechanism is language. Synthesis strives to achieve unity and meaning of knowledge; it is necessary for resolving contradictions, concentrating will and for purposeful actions. Synthesis connects language and cognition. Its main mechanisms are emotionality of languages and the hierarchy of the mind. Differentiation and synthesis are in complex relationship of symbiosis and opposition. This Leads to complex dynamics of evolution of consciousness and languages. Its mathematical modeling predicts evolution of cultures. We discuss existing evidence and future research directions.},

  abstract={Increasing use of heuristic algorithms in various fields of science causes numerous modifications of the original algorithms in need for better performance and efficiency. The main problem of heuristics is time required to find optimal solution. For this purpose, we propose to use parallel processing in the initial phase of heuristic methods to decrease computing time. Implemented technique models migration of individuals by adjusting initial population to required conditions. Proposed approach is simulating parallel processes that take place in human brain while solving tasks. In this case, human intelligence is working parallel on various aspects of the problem to compare them in the end before final decision. Proposed approach is simulating this parallelization of thinking threads in the process of optimization.

  abstract={The Hierarchical Inheritance Algorithm (HGA) is an optimization technique inspired by biological principles of natural selection and heredity. This approach is versatile, finding applications in fields such as combinatorial optimization, machine learning, adaptive control, and more. It stands as a cornerstone in the realm of intelligent computing. This study bridges the gap between information technology and progressive management methodologies, aiming to adapt outdated financial management strategies to the demands of a digitalized environment, thereby pioneering a centralized financial management paradigm in the digital realm. The focus of this paper is to explore this digitally-centered financial management framework and propose a design tailored to the online ecosystem. Our findings indicate that the concept of smart finance goes beyond a mere blend of "AI and finance." Implementing its technologies involves a unique methodology that thrives on "closed-loop thinking." By gleaning insights from AI applications in diverse sectors, we've outlined the foundational pillars of smart finance application: digital transformation of specialized financial operations, algorithms rooted in financial logic that are fine-tuned through iterations, the fusion of data analytics within financial operations leading to product-centric solutions, and achieving a significant 90.00% platform integration for these smart financial solutions. As artificial intelligence technology continues to evolve, financial management will undoubtedly gravitate towards being instantaneous, user-centric, and intelligent. This will usher in heightened efficiency and benefits, heralding a new age in financial management.},

  abstract={Significant gap between software programming model and execution model is one major slowing factor in the development of the emerging field of Internet-of-Things. It is also one of the main reasons why software systems often lag behind hardware technologies and fail to capture the full potentials of modern day hardware infrastructure, which is mostly parallel and distributed. We need to change the way we think about software fundamentally, and make it, at its most basic level, to work like the physical world works: distributed, parallel, loosely connected, and asynchronous. KnoRBA achieves this by making the basic components of any program, such as a common word processor, to be asynchronous mobile agents. Then through provision of implementation and location transparency it establishes integration across a distributed environment. This extended abstract is an early introduction to the new revision of KnoRBA that makes it efficient in a domain like sensor networks where power and bandwidth are critical factors.},

  abstract={Over the past decades, numerous practical applications of machine learning techniques have shown the potential of AI-driven and data-driven approaches in a large number of computing fields. Machine learning is increasingly included in computing curricula in higher education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are expanding it in K-12 computing education, too. As machine learning enters K-12 computing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the context of such systems is developed becomes a key research area. But as schools and teachers are already struggling with integrating traditional computational thinking and traditional artificial intelligence into school curricula, understanding the challenges behind teaching machine learning in K-12 is an even more daunting challenge for computing education research. Despite the central position of machine learning and AI in the field of modern computing, the computing education research body of literature contains remarkably few studies of how people learn to train, test, improve, and deploy machine learning systems. This is especially true of the K-12 curriculum space. This article charts the emerging trajectories in educational practice, theory, and technology related to teaching machine learning in K-12 education. The article situates the existing work in the context of computing education in general, and describes some differences that K-12 computing educators should take into account when facing this challenge. The article focuses on key aspects of the paradigm shift that will be required in order to successfully integrate machine learning into the broader K-12 computing curricula. A crucial step is abandoning the belief that rule-based âtraditionalâ programming is a central aspect and building block in developing next generation computational thinking.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1585-1596},
  abstract={In intelligent transportation systems, accurate long-term traffic forecasting is informative for administrators and travelers to make wise decisions in advance. Recently proposed spatial-temporal forecasting models perform well for short-term traffic forecasting, but two challenges hinder their applications for long-term forecasting in practice. Firstly, existing traffic forecasting models do not have satisfactory scalability on effectiveness and efficiency, i.e., as the prediction time spans extend, existing models either cannot capture the long-term spatial-temporal dynamics of traffic data or equip global receptive fields at the cost of quadratic computational complexity. Secondly, the dilemma between the modelsâ strong appetite for high-quality training data and their generalization ability is also a challenge we have to face. Thus how to improve data utilization efficiency deserves thoughtful thinking. Aiming at solving the long-term traffic forecasting problem and facilitating the deployment of traffic forecasting models in practice, this paper proposes an efficient and effective Self-supervised Spatial-Temporal Bottleneck Attentive Network (SSTBAN). Specifically, SSTBAN follows a multi-task framework by incorporating a self-supervised learner to produce robust latent representations for historical traffic data, so as to improve its generalization performance and robustness for forecasting. Besides, we design a spatial-temporal bottleneck attention mechanism, reducing the computational complexity meanwhile encoding global spatial-temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments on real-world long-term traffic forecasting tasks, including traffic speed forecasting and traffic flow forecasting under nine scenarios, demonstrate that SSTBAN not only achieves the overall best performance but also has good computation efficiency and data utilization efficiency.},

  pages={380-392},
  abstract={Factor graph, as a bipartite graphical model, offers a structured representation by revealing local connections among graph nodes. This study explores the utilization of factor graphs in modeling the autonomous racecar planning problem, presenting an alternate perspective to the traditional optimizationbased formulation. We model the planning problem as a probabilistic inference over a factor graph, with factor nodes capturing the joint distribution of motion objectives. By leveraging the duality between optimization and inference, a fast solution to the maximum a posteriori estimation of the factor graph is obtained via least-squares optimization. The localized design thinking inherent in this formulation ensures that motion objectives depend on a small subset of variables. We exploit the locality feature of the factor graph structure to integrate the minimum curvature path and local planning computations into a unified algorithm. This diverges from the conventional separation of global and local planning modules, where curvature minimization occurs at the global level. The evaluation of the proposed framework demonstrated superior performance for cumulative curvature and average speed across the racetrack. Furthermore, the results highlight the computational efficiency of our approach. While acknowledging the structural design advantages and computational efficiency of the proposed methodology, we also address its limitations and outline potential directions for future research.},

  abstract={With the progress of science and technology, quantum computing plays an increasingly important role in various fields, solving the traditional arithmetic bottleneck. In the financial field, credit scoring is the core of the lending industry and one of the most common risk management tools. Researchers are trying to find the best threshold-setting scheme to maximize revenue through quantum computing. This approach not only solves the optimization problem in the field of credit score cards, but also provides a new way of thinking about optimization problems in other fields. In this paper, three traditional computational models, one-fold credit card strategy, two-fold credit card combination strategy, and three-fold credit card combination strategy, are proposed, and the credit score card scheme that maximizes the final revenue is solved for each of the three models. The results show that under the one-fold credit card strategy, the final income is maximized at $54,087.2; under the two-fold credit card combination strategy, the final income is maximized at $41,106.3; and under the three-fold credit card combination strategy, the final income is maximized at $27,914.8. Secondly, this paper converts these three strategies to the QUBO model and obtains the maximum final income that is consistent with the maximum under the traditional model, with an accuracy of 96.3%, 92.7%, and 89.9% for the three combination strategies, respectively.},

These future generations will not be afraid of robotics and smart systems permeating their living realm. But technology is never good or bad out of itself â it depends on us how we apply it. The bigger the disruption, the larger the responsibility that comes with it. As chair of the global IEEE TechEthics initiative, Dominik fosters educated discourse about the application of technology and its impact on society and humankind. He is founder and chairman of the Robotic & AI Governance Foundation, pushing for governance structures to (self-)regulate the research, development and productization of automation technologies.},

  abstract={In this paper we proposed a joint model of simultaneous instruction with laboratory sessions to reinforce and enrich the learning experience so as to train better engineers able to compete globally. In accomplishing this, we integrated MATLAB/Simulink, the de facto standard for technical computing into the university curriculum for teaching four Computer Engineering courses namely Numerical Methods, Signals and Systems, Digital Control Systems and Digital Signal Processing during the 2010/2011 academic year at the University of Ghana. The course modules were developed in consultation with others and taught over the period of 13 weeks. The semester examinations consisted of laboratory and written exams sessions of three hours duration. After grading and collating of examinations results, it was clearly demonstrated by students that they have learnt the key requirements in engineering education. The statistics was staggering and interesting; for example 90 students registered the Numerical Methods, one withdrew due to ill-health and 89 students passed the seemingly difficult course with good grades.},

  title={Social Modeling as an Interdisciplinary Research Practice}, 
  year={2008},
  volume={23},
  number={4},
  pages={20-27},
  abstract={Social modeling applies computational methods and techniques to the analysis of social processes and human behavior. It's expected to provide conceptual and technological tools for supporting analysis and decision making in areas related to national and public security, political stability, law and order, and sociocultural changes. Modeling social and cultural processes must draw on the knowledge obtained within social sciences, including conceptual models, cultural insights, and empirical data. However, how to best integrate social scientific knowledge into modeling remains an open research problem. The author presents the perspective of a social scientist to describe why modeling can be useful for social research on political violence, social conflicts, and cultural changes. She develops an interactionist approach to interdisciplinary research practice and discusses how this approach can help identify the problems related to the integration of social scientific knowledge in modeling. The discussion focuses upon research on political violence and related sociocultural processes.},

  abstract={The purpose of this study is to look at Cloud Computing Security. The term âcloud computingâ refers to a way of delivering services over the internet. As a network service, computing resources are made available. These services are cost-effective, scalable, and self-contained. Cloud computing is responsible for the IT industry's rapid growth. Despite its many benefits, it has a number of security concerns that must be addressed. In order to make Cloud Computing even more secure and trustworthy, some efforts must be made against the model's hazards. All of the risks linked with Cloud Computing, as well as potential cures, are evaluated in this paper. Various resources like as memory, software, CPU, and network services are offered on-demand via the internet in cloud computing. Because all resources such as hardware, software, and network are used without physically purchasing them, the company's primary investment in the cloud is retained. Many advances are being implemented in the cloud platform to deliver a better experience for cloud users.},

  abstract={Sound recognition refers to the technology or process of identifying and classifying different sounds or audio signals. This study aims to develop a sound recognition system using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to classify and identify the gender of catfish based on their speech patterns. The study explores a range of supervised ML and DL algorithms, such as the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), NaÃ¯ve Bayes (NB), and others, to predict the gender of catfish. The extracted features from the audio signals of the catfish serve as inputs to these algorithms, which produce binary predictions classifying the catfish samples as either male or female. This study further explores data analysis of the audio signals from the male and female catfish. The automated sound recognition system proves to be a more efficient and accurate approach compared to traditional methods, which rely on time-consuming visual observations. Evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Sensitivity, and more, were employed to gauge the effectiveness of the algorithms in predicting the gender of catfish based on speech patterns. Among the employed algorithms, ANN and NB demonstrate the highest accuracy, achieving a score of 89.47%.},
