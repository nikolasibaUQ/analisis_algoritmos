  abstract={More and more digital supports are being developed to assist creativity. Some of them are designed to uniquely support specific creative methods, while others target the overall support of the creativity and innovation process. Whatever they might offer, only a few use a systems engineering approach. Generally, they do not formalize the environment or interactions within it. The present study proposes a new formalism for modelling the creativity process through the design of a Creative Support System (CSS). This formalism attempts to model an Innovation Challenge and is inspired by actual system engineering modelling formalisms and the literature on creativity. The first section will discuss CSS support of the “48h to Generate Ideas®” creativity challenge. Following this, the new representation formalism will be discussed. The conclusion will focus on the application of this formalism and establishment of the basis for future research.},

  abstract={A lot of attention has been given to the pedagogical method referred to as "flipping" the classroom. Many previous studies and conference presentations have shown that while students do not perform any worse in flipped classrooms than in a traditional format. However, a thoughtful design of the time spent in class can improve performance. This work-in-progress paper is a narrative of one course's journey over several semesters from traditional lecture to flipped classroom, and the observations of the impact that in-class and out of class activities had on overall performance of students. Brief descriptions of many course assignments and activities are included. In addition, the preliminary plan for evaluating how to create an inverted classroom that can support building lifelong learning skills is presente.},

  abstract={Advanced and abstract concepts of engineering and sciences are difficult to teach using traditional media such as whiteboards and still slides. In the computer networking classroom, teachers have the challenging task of communicating abstract ideas and concepts such as the Open Systems Interconnect Model (OSI Model), Message Encapsulation, Protocol Stacks and many others. Modern teaching methods such as case studies, laboratory experience, visiting real-world scenarios and story-telling are commonly and easily practiced. In this paper we identify the challenges faced by teachers of computer networking in Malaysian polytechnics and study how animated media can be a most valuable tool to use in communicating the abstract and advanced concepts of computer communication to students in this institutions. We discuss some preliminary ideas on the development of animated and interactive media for teaching computer networking and elucidate the benefits of using animated media.},

  abstract={Many conflicts emanate from failure to understand others’ perspectives. Computationally supported roleplaying games have the potential to promote successful perspective taking. When implemented with the affordances of virtual reality, nuances of embodied communication in roleplaying can be more robustly modeled. In this paper, we describe the design and development of a roleplaying game aimed at simulating ingroup-outgroup biases with the goal of supporting positive perspective taking in virtual reality: On the Plane. The game presents players with a simulation of air travel experience, from airport security screening to in-flight events. On the Plane affords the ability to experience the simulation as different characters, supporting both ingroup and outgroup perspectives. We describe how the game is structured to simulate and challenge ingroupoutgroup biases within the context of xenophobia and lay out our plans for future research using On the Plane to promote positive perspective transformation (e.g., challenging one’s own ill-founded preconceptions).},

  abstract={In education, computer learning systems make wide use of pedagogical agents to simulate a tutor and/or mimic tutoring interaction, as well as offering just-in-time and adaptive feedback. Although the theoretical aspect of the pedagogical agents has been well-documented in the literature, relatively fewer efforts have been made on how a pedagogical agent should be implemented in a real multimedia computerized simulation learning environment. In this paper, we propose a pedagogical agent architecture and implement it in the multimedia medical simulation web-based learning system call HINTS to further facilitate students' learning and thereby make the HINTS a more effective educational tool. A preliminary students' performance evaluation result is reported.

  abstract={Cyberbullying, the act of intentionally causing harm to others through electronic communication, has emerged as a critical societal concern, particularly among university students. With the rapid proliferation of digital technologies, university campuses have become hotspots for cyberbullying incidents, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of the underlying factors driving this phenomenon. This paper presents a systematic review that aims to identify and analyze the key factors influencing cyberbullying behaviours among university students. The conceptual framework that was utilized to pinpoint the factors influencing university students' cyberbullying behaviours was examined in this study. According to a systematic screening of recent research articles (from 2013 to 2023) pertaining to online bullying behaviours among university students, the findings were given. After evaluating theoretical models and associated concepts, we suggest using the Theory of Planned Behaviour to evaluate factors influencing cyberbullying behaviours among university students. The findings of this study are discussed, and it is concluded that subjective norms, attitude, perceived behavioural control, social media use, and intentions all have the ability to influence university students' cyberbullying behaviours.},

  abstract={3D printing is a contemporary method of three-dimensional objects’ production. Prior to the printing, the object must be designed in the form of its 3D model - a virtual spatial body. The model is then transferred into a computer program which will control the printing process. Finally, the object is composed using a stepwise addition of micro-particles (grains).3D printing is very appropriate for the individualized production i.e. for fabricating unique objects or those done in small series. A typical lifecycle of these objects is "Design it – Produce it – Make use of it". A growing interest in this extent of production requires preparing enough 3D-printing specialists in a variety disciplines. In our presentation, we discuss what professionals are needed and what modifications of contemporary schooling would fulfil these requirements to a maximum degree.},

  abstract={Mobile learning is an inevitable result of technological progress, which is achieved through networks. Compared to traditional learning modes, using mobile phones for learning is not limited by geography or learning forms, and has great freedom in time and space. This is an informal remote teaching based on digitization and mobile computer devices. Autonomous learning breaks through the limitations of traditional learning models and enables learners to better utilize their fragmented time for learning. Based on the above issues, this article discussed how to build a mobile assisted language translation intelligent recommendation system using NPL (Natural Language Processing) technology. Finally, experimental data showed that the system designed in this article had the smallest parameter size but the shortest training time, with values of only 16M and 5.649min/epoch, respectively. This indicated that the language translation system designed in this article had strong advantages, which can reduce the size of model parameters and thus reduce the training time of the model. The experiment verified the superiority of the mobile assisted language translation system based on NPL.},

We then discuss an orientational metaphor that has a basis in physical experience, and we attempt to retrieve clues for solving the generation of concepts by simulating concrete examples, for example, by detecting objects that build a pattern of leg locomotion to approach the object. The pattern is an insignificant set of weight matrices; however, this pattern is grounded in the environment and the body. We then discuss what is represented in the agent action by using the simulation results. In addition, we mention the construction of concepts, such as the GOOD-BAD concept.},

  abstract={Image captioning stands as a pivotal technique for providing contextual descriptions of visual content, promising substantial enhancement in the capabilities of conversational AI systems. This work delves into the integration of image captioning methodologies into ChatGPT, aiming to fortify its capacity in understanding and responding to visual information. The study extensively explores the application of deep learning models, encompassing ResNet50, LSTM, DenseNet121, MobileNet, and MobileNetv2, in the domain of image captioning. Specifically, a comprehensive investigation is conducted into a Recurrent Neural Network employing LSTM as a decoder and a Convolutional Neural Network utilizing ResNet as an encoder. These fusion harnesses vocabulary and image features to craft precise and meaningful descriptions of visual content. Furthermore, this study pioneers an approach to identify and relate at least two salient features within any given image, forming a coherent caption that binds the relationship between these identified features. This novel capability not only refines image captioning techniques but also empowers ChatGPT to comprehend complex visual contexts within conversational settings. The outcomes of this work offer profound insights into augmenting AI capabilities, facilitating a deeper understanding and more effective interaction with visual information across various domains, thereby advancing the field of conversational AI integration with visual context.},

  abstract={Music learning is important for preschool children’s musical development, but preschool children are considered to have limited cognitive development and have difficulties understanding abstract musical concepts. Tangible interaction can introduce physical entities into the interaction, allowing children to use their daily life experiences to interact with the computer, reducing the cognitive load and therefore improving the effectiveness of music learning. Combining the cognitive characteristics and physical ability level of preschool children, a design model of a music learning system for preschool children based on tangible interaction is constructed with reference to existing research models, and a set of design recommendations based on this model is proposed. This paper also designs and develops an interactive prototype Music Magician for preschool children to learn music and completes the construction of an interactive action library and iteration of the prototype after pre-experiment feedback. The validity of the prototype is verified through experiments, and the rationality of the proposed design model and design recommendations is also validated.},

  abstract={In research aimed at determining the level of interest of high school students in enrolling in colleges, predictive analysis models and comparisons are rarely applied during the classification and processing of various data. All of this leads to significant fluctuations in college admissions, where certain schools are unable to admit a large number of students who show interest in a specific field. On the other hand, high school students lose interest in certain schools, leading to the discontinuation of specific directions essential for today's job market needs. Institutions largely fail to conduct a comparison and linkage of teaching and non-teaching activities when analyzing the talents and interests of high school students from different fields. The goal of this paper is to use programming language classifiers to predict student enrollments in colleges based on the results students demonstrate during regular attendance in high schools through participation in innovation fairs.},

  abstract={The South African government continuously strives to work on the development of legislations that protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its citizen's information in the digital space. The contagion of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) led to a global lockdown that put governments in emergency mode. Post-COVID-19, the benefits of digitization became more noticeable. During the lockdown era cloud computing proved its effectiveness and efficiency in helping employees continue working even outside of their workstations. The objective of this paper is to scrutinize the current state of cloud data protection in the public sector within South Africa. The emphasis is placed on the draft National policy for cloud and data storage. This paper also makes recommendations to further strengthen and improve the current state of South Africa's cloud and data storage. It goes further to review existing legislations such as POPI, ECT, and cyber law acts and their relevance to the draft National Data and Cloud Policy. A proposal for a model that incorporates the cloud-shared responsibility model is presented and briefly discussed.},

  abstract={The challenges met during the software projects fall into any number of categories. The development and the technical solutions bring about technical challenges, but the situations one is confronted with, may also be sociological, psychological or managerial in nature. Without any knowledge in the field of social sciences, the programmers, testers and managers might interpret the social aspects of the project improperly, and such interpretations lead to the inability to fully understand the problem and, ultimately, to inefficiency in the decision-making process. Furthermore, solid knowledge of theories in the area of the social sciences is required for a better understanding of both the context in which the application runs and of the final users who will use the developed project. The understanding of and the involvement in a software acceptance testing (SAT) project, requires the combination of multiple theories and principles from different disciplines.},
