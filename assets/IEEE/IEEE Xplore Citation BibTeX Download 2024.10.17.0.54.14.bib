  abstract={Introduction to programming is a traditional and compulsory course for first year Computer Science students. However, research in the field of computer science education has highlighted that many students lack on problem solving and computational thinking skills. These issues provoke questions in the academic community as to whether the learning methodology of introductory to programming courses is appropriate. As regards the pedagogical procedure in general, the teacher-centered model was amended with the introduction of Interactive Learning Environments, which promote distributed learning. In this paper, we examine the fundamental skills needed for introductory to programming courses. Additionally, we focus on some of the most popular micro worlds and evaluate them in terms of educational suitability.},

  pages={000335-000340},
  abstract={The process of implementing coding at schools attended by pupils from six to fourteen years of age is a current trend in developed countries. In some cases, simple activities involving coding might be even included at kindergartens attended by children from three years of age. The crucial aim is to develop the so-called computational thinking which is going to be more and more essential for a successful personal and professional development of every individual. There is a broad range of factors influencing the success of the change in the curriculum, which is, inter alia, supposed to include coding. In addition to the necessary teaching aids and know-how, teachers also need to have positive attitudes towards its implementation. The main objective of our research is to identify teachers' attitudes towards introducing coding to their classes. We discovered that not all teachers of computing agree with including algorithmization and coding in their teaching. Approximately one half of the questioned educators hold a negative attitude towards the curricular change; they would rather continue teaching computer user skills and basic programs. Their attitude proves to be an impediment to a successful curricular change as teachers should fully grasp the teaching content and communicate it with enthusiasm to their pupils. Insufficient knowledge is the key factor influencing teachers' negative attitudes towards the introduction of coding to schools.},

  abstract={Summary <p>This chapter details what is involved in Produce, the second stage of any Critical Systems Practice (CSP) intervention. Produce is concerned with the design of an appropriate intervention strategy based on the learning derived from Explore. It continues to carry forward the commitments of Critical Systems Thinking (CST) by selecting appropriate systems methodologies, models and methods that will later be used in a pluralist fashion to drive multifaceted improvement in a situation of interest. The success of Produce rests on understanding the purposes, strengths and weaknesses of different systems methodologies. Five types of systems methodology are identified and described &#x2013; engineering, system dynamics (SD), living, soft and emancipatory. These are shown to relate to the five systemic perspectives that were employed to provide an appreciation of the situation of interest in Explore. Examples are provided of how different methodologies were chosen as &#x2018;dominant&#x2019; at different times to steer interventions. Finally, some possible objections to what Produce suggests are discussed.</p>},

  abstract={Artificial Wisdom is advancement of Artificial Intelligence where wisdom should be recognized with the intelligence. It means the constructive behavior and values of humanity need to be the part of Artificial intelligence by incorporating wisdom. These can be demonstrates by simulating thought process and hence thinking ability of human beings is recognized as the consciousness. Currently researchers are working on thoughts and consciousness. These thoughts are coexisted with the particular mental factor. Abhidhamma model of ancient Indian literature are claimed 52 mental factors which are categorized in basic three classes such as Ethically Variable Factor, Unwholesome Factor and Beautiful Factor. Proposed model demonstrates the classification of the mental states. Dataset consists of 445 samples collected from various respondents by asking three questions. Preprocessing is performed by using the techniques of Natural language processing and Non-axiomatic logic. Convolutional Neural Network Machine learning technique applied to classify the mental factors. Performance of the proposed system is measured by applying statistical measures such as Accuracy, Precision, Specificity, Recall and F1-Score. Accuracy for small and large database is obtained as 86.92 percent and 93.02 percent respectively.},

  abstract={Graduate students at the University of Maryland's College of Information Studies (UMD iSchool) collaborated in interdisciplinary teams on a case study to explore application of computational methodologies to datafied collections related to slavery in the Maryland State Archives (MSA). Two research questions were examined: (1) What are the opportunities and limitations for using computational methods and open source tools to characterize data encoded within records of enslavement and to discover new patterns and relationships in that data? (2) How does knowledge of social and cultural systems impact those opportunities and limitations? Computational methods and tools were most effectively used when socio-cultural contextualization and technology's role as a mediator of representation were taken into account. Three additional technical research areas are identified to enhance recovery of heritage hidden in records of enslavement: visualization, graph databases, and ontologies and metadata.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={109-113},
  abstract={Music generation has been an active field of research in computer science and is considered as a creative task attempting to imitate human creativity. With the different approaches to generate musical content, recent works have focused on general adversarial networks. One of these is the Midinet, which is considered the baseline model in this study. In this paper, we propose our Next Bar Predictor, a generative model that creates melody one bar at a time using the previous bar as basis to generate aesthetically pleasing melodies. We explore several variants of this by experimenting on different regression and classification models such as Decision Trees (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The models were trained using the dataset from Theorytab which consists of 460 songs. The outputs of these different variant models were then compared against those from the Midinet, using both machine-based objective scoring mechanism as well as human-based subjective evaluations. The dissimilarity scores obtained by our KNN (0.65) and DT (0.74) models, scored against the melodies in the dataset, are sufficiently high and indicates that both models are generally creative. Furthermore, based on the evaluation by human listeners, the melodies generated by our DT models are more realistic and pleasing than those of the Midinet. Casual listeners also prefer the DT model to be more interesting, although professional listeners think otherwise. Finally, all the variant models, when compared with Midinet, require much less training time and computational power. The proposed Next Bar Predictor is therefore a viable alternative for automated music generation.},

  abstract={Trust based situation awareness represents the flow of information regarding a situation within a group of agents based on their mutual trust. Situation Awareness (SA) in general is regarded as basis for efficient group decision making while trust based situation awareness is of utmost importance in safety critical systems as the trust is a key factor that tend to affect the beliefs of agents that are collaborating in an environment. In this study an existing model of situation awareness is extended to incorporate mutual trust of the participating agents. The proposed model is analyzed using two different paradigms of computational modeling techniques namely Agent Based Modeling (ABM) and Population Based Modeling (PBM). Various experiments are conducted using variety of populations. Results show that with incorporation of trust factor, both approaches show similar patterns with large population size. In addition to that, relation between SA and trust is analyzed and the results show that SA gets affected by the inter-agent trust.},

  pages={4-5},
  abstract={It is recognized that the key theoretical and technical problems toward the next generation internet are not only a speed issue, but also a more fundamental issue of the increasingly demands for the sharing of computational intelligent capabilities. According to cognitive informatics [1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 14, 16, 18], the cognitive information that humans acquire, process, retain, and share can be classified into four profound forms known as knowledge, experience, skill, and wisdom. Among them, wisdom is the most advanced cognitive objects, which is a form of natural intelligence of humans that transfers a query or instruction into an action or behavior based on a well developed reasoning and judgment. However, the current Internet is still remains as an information network. Towards the development of next generation Internet as a wisdom network, the World Wide Wisdom (WWW+) network infrastructures and technologies are yet to be sough t on the basis of cognitive informatics and cognitive computers. In WWW+, each node is a cognitive computer (CC) [3, 9, 10, 15], which is a form of autonomous and intelligent computers that think, perceive, and learn. CC enables the simulation of machinable thought such as computational inferences, reasoning, and causality analyses by autonomous inferences and perceptions mimicking the mechanisms of the brain [3, 15]. The cognitive learning engine of a CC is an autonomous learning system that enables machines learn in natural languages and symbolic notations. The cognitive search engine of a CC is a machine-learning-based search system that results in cognitive knowledge acquisitions and manipulations. On the basis of the development of CCs, the next generation internet, WWW+, will be developed as a world-wide intelligent network for knowledge processing, autonomous learning, and machine-supported problem solving. The theoretical foundations for WWW+ and cognitive computing are cognitive informatics [1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 14, 16, 18], with underpinning contemporary denotational mathematics [6, 12], such as concept algebra [7], system algebra [17], realtime process algebra [4, 8], granular algebra [12], and visual semantic algebra [11]. Denotational mathematics provides a coherent set of powerful mathematical means and explicit expressive power for the design, modeling, and implementation of cognitive computers and WWW+, as that of Boolean algebra for conventional computing technologies. WWW+ extends the current information-search-based Internet to wisdom providing and intelligence services that mimic and simulate the brain in the largest scope of the cyberspace in which each node plays a role as an autonomous super neural cell. As that the conventional Internet provides a solution to the “to be” category of problems for information sharing based on searching technologies, the WWW+-based internet solves the advanced “to do” category of problems for wisdom and intelligence capability sharing based on cognitive computing technologies. WWW+ will be the largest scope of computational intelligence and the closest embodiment of the brain as interconnected constituent intelligent components. A wide range of applications of WWW+ and cognitive computers have been identified such as, inter alia, theories, methodologies, and infrastructures of collective intelligence, networks of computational intelligence, services providing networks, distributed agent networks, distributed cognitive sensor networks, and distributed remote control systems.},

  pages={67-74},
  abstract={A study was carried out which examined the extent to which young people aged 11-12, with no prior instruction in programming, are able to write computational rules which govern play in a 3D computer role-playing game. Expressing these rules required the use of common computational structures such as conditionals, sets and loops. We analysed the rules written for their structure and style, and recorded the types of errors made. It was found that although young people were able to abstract away from the game play experience, very few of the rules were error-free. The most common errors were errors of omission (leaving elements out that should have been included) rather than errors of commission (including elements which should not be part of the rule). These findings have implications for the design of the Flip language, which aims to support young people as they begin to develop computational skills through game design.},

Today’s 20-year-olds were forced to live one tenth of their lives, i.e., 2 years, locked in their homes, isolated from friends and university peers, during the COVID -19 pandemic. Hardly had they recovered from the threat of the pandemic, from their grief, when they were hit by another trauma, as were other members of society. War in neighbouring Ukraine, serious energy crisis, climate crisis, skyrocketing inflation, uncertain future…The focus of the research was therefore on the question of what kind of life they would be satisfied with, and what they would do to achieve the quality of life they want. What goals do they have, what do they want to achieve in their lives? Are human relationships important to them? As our interviewees were marketing students, we asked them if they were happy buying a product or using a service, how important is the experience of buying a product or service to them? How do they think about this topic, what strategy do they want to follow as marketing employees based on their life experiences? Their way of thinking is also decisive at a societal level.},

  abstract={Agility - like the XXI. one of the fashionable concepts and leading approaches of the 20th century - it came into the spotlight after the 2000s. At first, as a new project management methodology, it was included in the thinking, which is able to eliminate the shortcomings and slowness of the classic waterfall model, thus making project management more efficient, directing them towards successful projects. Seeing the success of agile project management, more and more companies and businesses began to agileize their various organizational units as well, and finally the mindset spread to the whole organization. Today, we interpret the concept of agility not only at the organizational level, but also at the individual level. However, the willingness of individuals and employees to agility differs along a number of factors. It is influenced by an individual's age, generation affiliation, education, culture, which determines the extent to which he or she is able to embrace this new way of thinking. In our study, we look for the answer to what agility means as a term in the reading of respondents of each generation. The basis of our study is a questionnaire research carried out in Hungary, which was also part of an international research.},

  abstract={Cognitive Computing is a developing paradigm with its applications found in almost every field. It aims to develop computing methodologies and systems inspired by mind’s capabilities. A thought is the most fundamental capability of the mind. Hence it is important in the cognitive computing to understand the Thought Process. The purpose of this paper is to develop a computer model that simulates the Thought Process. The paper proposes that the Genetic Algorithm (GA) can be used for the same. Both cognitive model and computer model of the thought process with the help of GA has been given. In the computer model, a modification of GA has been implemented, which consists of a new crossover operator called Learning Crossover operator. The new crossover operator is not a replacement but is a supplement to the existing crossover operators. The GA is implemented over the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP), which is a classical NP problem and hence the algorithm is possible to be implemented on any other problem. The modification to the GA aims to improve the Thought Process Simulation. But it can also improve the performance of GA, when further explored.},

These new technologies, ideas and approaches provide a new environment for researching and developing the economy-based resource scheduling system. Aiming at the hierarchical grid model, following load balancing thinking and cost-time optimization strategies, this paper proposes a new grid resource scheduling algorithm, which can not only increase the utilization of resources and system throughput, but also realize the load balancing and utility optimization between resource providers and users within grid systems. On the basis of having described the different functional parts of the proposed algorithm, two kinds of simulative experiments about completion time and cost of tasks are conducted. Finally, the experiment results show that the proposed algorithm is effective.},

  title={Evaluating the Aesthetics of Endgame Studies: A Computational Model of Human Aesthetic Perception}, 
  year={2012},
  volume={4},
  number={3},
  pages={178-191},
  abstract={In this paper, we explain how an existing computational aesthetics model for three-move mate problems was improved and adapted to suit the domain of chess endgame studies. Studies are typically longer and more “sophisticated” in terms of their perceived aesthetics or beauty. They are therefore likely a better test of the capability of machines to evaluate beauty in the game. Based on current validation methods for an aesthetics model such as this, the experimental results confirm that the adaptation was successful. In the first experiment, the new model enabled a computer program to distinguish correctly between composed studies and positions with sequences resembling studies taken from real games. In the second, the computational aesthetic evaluations were shown to correlate positively and well with human expert aesthetic assessment. The new model encompasses the previous three-mover one and can be used to evaluate beauty as perceived by humans in both domains. This technology pushes the boundaries of computational chess and can be of benefit to human players, composers, and judges. To some extent, it may also contribute to our understanding of the psychology of human aesthetic perception and the “mechanics” of human creativity in composing problems and studies.},

  abstract={In order to solve the problem that the current technology software cannot meet the needs of basketball players, the investigator used simulation technology to investigated the simulated competitive thinking of the national basketball team, in which they emphasize the need for competitive thinking simulation and the cooperative development model.The simulation sport thinking was summarized. There are advantages in many aspects, but traditional competitive thinking should still be the dominant training method." At the same time, the degree of similarity of the team’s competitive thinking model has different effects on team performance obvious to see. When the basketball team’s overall competitive thinking pattern is more similar, team performance is also more significant.},

  abstract={Recently, research on the development of artificial intelligence, in particular generative AI, has been active around the current world. Recent research mainly focuses on generating various types of outputs (text, image, video, etc.) from natural language textual inputs. However, understanding the meaning of these prompts in AI remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a mechanism for extracting Cartoon images via UML Models based on natural language-based specifications, mapping a cut image's cartoon elements with UML properties extracted through linguistic textual analysis in software engineering. We expect software engineers to automatically help toon writers generate a cartoon's image with linguistic mechanisms.},

  abstract={In this dialogue with expert Dr. Jean Botev, we will first discuss different definitions of “sociotechnical” systems. This includes adding into our models and computational systems, the behavior, constraints on and policies of institutions and cultures, as well as social behaviors and social dynamics that are not institutionalized. Then we will address three hard questions: How does adding social, cultural and institutional information to our computational systems change our goals for and our approaches to these systems? How do we evaluate the success of sociotechnical systems? What are some of the key challenges to building sociotechnical systems?},

  abstract={Several instruments have been used for assessing Computational Thinking (CT) abilities. In this exploratory and preliminary study, we investigate how appropriate the Bebras challenge is as an instrument to assess and measure CT abilities. Bebras is an international challenge whose goal is to promote Computer Science and CT. The test can be answered without any prior knowledge on computer science. Our broad research question is whether we can evolve Bebras into a full fledged instrument to assess and measure CT abilities. In this paper, we instantiate a few more specific research questions: Is Bebras performance a good predictor of success for students within programming courses? Is there any correlation between Bebras performance and students' grades? Do students improve their performance in Bebras tests when exposed to the contents of a programming course? Our dataset consists of the grades of 138 students who attended introductory programming courses at two Brazilian universities and their performance in two simulated Bebras tests. The first test was applied at the beginning of the term and therefore before any exposition to programming classes. The second one was applied at the end of the term. The results suggest that the performance on Bebras is only moderately correlated to the student grades. We conclude that it is not very likely that CT measures can be derived from the Bebras test as it is currently designed. While further research is needed on how we can leverage the Bebras effort to extend it into a CT assessment instrument, we performed a preliminary study on the use of Item Response Theory (IRT) as a means to improve the selection of questions and the design of the test. We expect the results of this research can contribute both to the development and discussion on CT assessment as well as to the Bebras effort to educate CT.},

  abstract={The study explores the effects of an interdisciplinary learning approach on developing students’ English learning (EL) and computational thinking (CT) through two different game-based learning approaches. A quasi-experiment is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in terms of enhancing students’ CT knowledge and their EL achievement in an elementary school English as a foreign language (EFL) learning context. A total of 52 Grade 3 students take part in the experiment, of whom 28 are assigned to the experimental group learned with a machine educational robot (machine-ER) board game and 24 are assigned to the control group learned with a character educational robot (character-ER) board game. Results indicate that both groups made significant improvements in learning achievement: 1) in English-language achievement of learning vocabulary and sentence patterns; and 2) in CT concepts, although the machine-ER board game produces a greater increase than the character-ER board game in both language learning achievement and CT knowledge, their learning anxieties are also lower than those of the control group. The analysis of behavioral patterns also reveals that students playing the machine-ER board game demonstrate better language-learning interaction, whereas the students playing character-ER board game present greater CT development in finding solutions.},
