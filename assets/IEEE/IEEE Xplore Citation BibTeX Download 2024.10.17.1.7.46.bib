  abstract={This paper integrates the concept of agent negotiation into adaptive learning to support effective learner-instructor interaction. It intends to capture the interactions that are real between learner and instructor, but often simplified or even ignored in most adaptive learning approaches. An iterative negotiation protocol is employed to reconcile mutual thinking and cognitive differences between learner and instructor and then to dynamically produce the most appropriate learning sequences. To delineate the proposed framework, an example relevant to Java programming course is provided to illustrate how the adaptive learning environment with negotiation mechanism can improve the effectiveness of learning.},

  abstract={The deep multi-view stereo (MVS) approaches generally construct a cost volume pyramid in a coarse- to- fine manner to regularize and regress the depth or disparity, which is often built upon a feature pyramid encoding geometry or an image pyramid. A pyramid is an excellent approach to reducing memory, and many papers said even low-resolution images or features contain enough information for estimating low-resolution depth maps. However, recent papers show that the higher the image resolution, the better the output depth map, which means the resolution of depth maps in each stage cause effect on the final outputs. Therefore, we think the low-resolution depth map may not be enough for the high-resolution depth map. In this paper, we propose a sub-pixel upsampling module for post-processing the cost volume to generate a big resolution depth map at each stage. Besides, we also proposed an edge-weighted loss function for optimizing those inaccurate depth values in the edge regions of objects. Finally, we implement them on CasMVSNet, showing the effectiveness of our proposed method. The content of abstract.},

CNN is a type of convolution neural network that has an unpredictable development and uses convolution calculations. It is one of the most well-known deep learning algorithms. This review thinks about and inspects exemplary AI and profound learning picture classification procedures involving SVM and CNN as specific illustrations. Using a large sample mnist dataset, this study found that CNN has an accuracy of 0.97 and SVM has an accuracy of 0.89; SVM has an accuracy of 0.85 and CNN has an accuracy of 0.82 when working with a small sample ImageNet dataset.

  abstract={Granular information processing is one of the human-inspired problem-solving aspects of natural computing, as information abstraction is inherent in human thinking and reasoning processes, and plays an essential role in human cognition. Among the different facets of natural computing fuzzy sets, rough sets and their hybridization are well accepted paradigms that are based on the construction, representation and interpretation of granules, as well as the utilization of granules for problem solving. These tools are also known as primary constituents of soft computing whose objective is to provide flexible information processing capability for handling real-life ambiguous situations. They have been successfully employed in various image processing tasks, including image segmentation, enhancement and classification, both individually or in combination with other computing techniques. The reason of such success is rooted to the fact that they provide powerful tools to describe uncertainty, naturally embedded in images, which can be exploited in various image processing tasks.},

  abstract={System planners, architects, and developers often make the same mistakes on grand scales, but we usually stay with familiar approaches, especially under deadline pressures. Engineers and managers embrace the concept of process improvement, yet they rarely take time (or have the privilege of taking the time) to consider how something that has worked in the past could be improved. It is equally rare for them to make the effort to change plans and processes to benefit from mistakes. This article explores several high-level lessons learned, mostly on large system developments that were not always successful. The lessons concern project difficulties caused by thinking that's stuck in the present; excessive faith in code reuse; failure to see the big picture; absence of independent failure analysis; and estimation processes driven by fear and ignorance.},

In this talk, I will describe the TIOA framework in some detail, and summarize many of the examples to which it has been applied. Then, I will discuss the extensions that are needed to enable it to handle more kinds of algorithms. These extensions will mainly involve adding and integrating features for handling probabilistic choices.

This step thus usually ends up with the function definition of the IC in question and the choice of the center technology for its realization. In the design step, one "plans" how to build the IC to fulfill the desired specifications.

Then Web standard-JSF (Java Server Faces) is introduced to develop the system.

  abstract={In a number of tasks for assessing natural and medical prints, deep neural networks have bettered humans. These achievements, however, are solely reliant on properly labelled training data. When presented with a few samples of noisy-labelled images, the network training strategy might encounter difficulties, resulting in a suboptimal classification models. The quality of medical picture annotations strongly depends on the knowledge and experience of the annotators, which makes this difficulty more acute in the context of medical image analysis. Such problem arises due to a number of reasons ranging from human error, inexperience or even misreading of the images. But at the same time, proper labels are exceptionally useful in training models, while improperly labelled data actually hampers the efficiency of the model. Label for a lot of the image dataset out there is actually already generated, but when we think about the noisy labelled data and go for an unsupervised learning model instead of a supervised model the labels that are correct are also going to waste. To solve this problem without wasting labels, a sparsely supervised learning strategy based on transfer learning is constructed with the aid of the keras Xception model. This paper compares the efficiency of a sparsely supervised learning model employing transfer learning to that of other traditional CNN models based on their performance metrics.},

Despite changes in learning models, education providers certainly want to maintain academic quality by producing graduates with superior academics, practical knowledge, and innovative thinking. The problem currently faced is how education providers can monitor students' performance to complete their studies correctly. Therefore, a grade prediction is needed that helps students, lecturers, and administrators of educational institutions maintain and improve academic quality. This study compares the techniques.

How to ensure data security has aroused people's thinking. In order to ensure the communication security of network data, this paper points out the security threats in computer network communication, clarifies the significance of data encryption technology, and analyzes the commonly used data encryption methods in computer network communication. In this paper, a computer data security application model based on edge computing is constructed. In this model, data redundancy elimination method and differential privacy protection algorithm are adopted successively. After removing duplicate data and obtaining good quality data, the computer data is privacy protected, and the data security processing based on edge computing is realized. After testing, the privacy protection budget value of the built model is 0.23, and the computer data information leakage ratio based on edge computing is the smallest. Under this condition, the maximum data information leakage ratio based on edge computing is reduced from 0.678 to 0.234, and the data security is significantly improved.},

  abstract={Alzheimer's Detection is a dementia type affecting memory, thinking and behavior and the early detection is very critical due to the incurable nature of Alzheimer's. This literature proposes a method to contribute towards the early detection research of Alzheimer's disease. This paper introduces the fundamental theorem of Support Vector Machine algorithm and Convolution Neural Network classification ideas implemented on brain MRI images to early detect Alzheimer's disease. CNN and SVM are the types of research focuses of the classification and machine learning community. The paper uses Oasis data set consisting of cross-sectional and Longitudinal MRI data Kaggle dataset which contains brain MRI images. The paper compares SVM and the CNN model and compares the accuracy of the two algorithms. The literature can be very helpful in classification applications and studying the final prospects of SVM and CNN.},

  abstract={Epilepsy is considered as one of the most dangerous and fatal neurological disorder for the patient suffering from it. It affects the particular areas of the brain, due to which patient has seizures. Epilepsy is often referred to as ‘mirgi’ in the Hindi language. The purpose of the paper is to identify and understand the prediction of the seizures that occur due to neurological disorder called Epilepsy. Epilepsy can be explained as the disorder of central nervous system, which results in abnormal activities inside the brain. The impacts of this disorder come out as seizures, and patient behaves in a weird manner. Sometimes the patient can even lose the track of consciousness and sensations, the power of thinking and reacting is also affected. When seen during Electroencephalogram, the brain wave patterns which are observed appear to be different and abnormal. It is one of the difficult diseases to be diagnosed. In this project, we have tried to find out the result as whether the patient is having an epileptic seizure or not, using machine learning models, like KNN, logistic regression and naïve bayes. The Output label column of the dataset has the value whether patient is having (1) or not having (0) a seizure. In this paper, we have preprocessed the dataset and calculated the accuracies of the models on both training and testing datasets. Dataset is extracted from GitHub and the coding is performed in python programming language. Python libraries like seaborn, matplotlib, pandas, numpyetc are used in the pre-processing of the model. We have later on come to the result as out of the three models that we have used which one gives the best results, with the help of AUC value.},
