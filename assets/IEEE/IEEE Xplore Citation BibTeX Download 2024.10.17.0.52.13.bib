  abstract={Computational Thinking (CT) is a set of thinking processes used by computer scientists to formulate problems and describe solutions. In recent years, CT has been largely explored by the Computing Education community. Due to its potential to contribute to problem solving and analytical thinking, CT could also be a relevant subject in K-12 education. For such, there is a need to qualify educators in CT. In this paper, we describe our experience in a large-scale course on Computational Thinking for pre-service teachers. Our goal is to qualify pre-service teachers in CT, both in the comprehension of its definition and how it can be incorporated in classroom. Our experience indicates that the participants had a positive awareness of CT concepts, as well as an adequate understanding of the pedagogical approaches to teach the subject. They also developed positive attitudes towards the field of Computer Science.},

  abstract={Although Computer Science has grown to become one of the most highly demanded professional careers, every year, only a small percentage of students choose a degree directly related to Computer Science. Perhaps the problem lies in the lack of information that society has about Computer Science itself, and particularly about the work computer scientists do. No one doubts the role of Mathematics or Languages as core subjects in every primary and secondary education syllabus; however, Computer Science plays a negligible role in most current syllabuses. Only in a few countries have governments paid special attention to content related to Computer Science and to learning to analyze and solve problems the way computer scientists do (Computational Thinking). In this article, we present Piens@ Computacion@ULLmente, a project that provides a methodology to promote Computer Science through Computational Thinking activities among primary and secondary education students. The results obtained from an exhaustive statistical analysis of the data we collected demonstrate that the perception of Computer Science that pre-university students have can be improved through specific training. Moreover, we can also confirm that the performance of pre-university students involving Computational Thinking skills is independent of gender, particularly at the primary education level.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) is considered as the skill of 21st century. The fundamental CT concepts include abstraction, algorithm design, decomposition, pattern recognition, and data representation or generalization. CT assessment is required to improve the understanding of the cognitive abilities and to relate them in related areas, such as introductory programming in computer science. Assessing computational thinking skills however is a challenging issue since it measures latent variables that cannot be directly observed. In addition, according to psychometrics, appropriate test requires a validation process before it can be effectively used as a measuring instrument. Thus, high quality tools for measuring student learning in Introductory Programming have been under-developed and under-researched. The objective of this work is to determine the psychometric properties (item validity, reliability, discrimination, difficulty, and distractors) of the developed multiple-choice questions of computational thinking in introductory programming by exploring classical test theory and item response theory which has not been deeply investigated by previous studies. The analysis results reveal that most of items are valid and the items are generally adequate reliable. In spite of the fact that some items are suggested to be revised since the item discrimination values, the distribution of difficulties, and distractor points are less than the expected threshold.},

  abstract={Based on the analysis of some famous instructional cases in programming education and in-depth interviews with primary school teachers who are engaged in programming education, this paper focuses on the instructional procedure and strategies of primary school programming education for cultivating students' computational thinking. This examination reveals the current situation and possible problems in the practice of cultivating computational thinking and provide some useful references. Continuous comparison are used to code and analyze the interview data. The article founds that the instructional procedure of cultivating computational thinking in programming education generally involves five major stages: knowledge review, new knowledge exploration, problem analysis, programming on computer, and the stage of reflection. Instructional strategies accordingly include: mind map-supported, unplugged programming, flow chart use, pair programming, log reflection, and more. Finally, the paper concludes with the problems that appeared in teaching, especially in the stage of new knowledge exploration, unplugged programming and pair-programming.},

  abstract={Computation of time-dependent electromagnetic field excited by a varying current distribution is the hardcore of modern computational electromagnetism. However, differing from other computing forms of field problem described by partial differential equations, the computation of electromagnetic field did not really use series of the general, abstract and formalized methods. And people have to construct forms of different models to make computation. Such a method of computation can also arrange forms particular propositions suitably. But, it cannot be regarded as a universal method and it is usually implicates some logic mistakes and physical distortion. The reason would be: time-dependent electromagnetic field lacks of a united mathematical physical model that can guarantee both the partial differential equations and boundary conditions consistent in logic. In reverse, if a general mathematical model is perfect in logic, it can not only allow us to effectively use the computation methods supplied by computational mathematics but also provide more full and more exact information about electromagnetic field.},

  abstract={Central to the theory of learning are inquiry-based approaches to education. Whereas there is a plethora of research on inquiry learning in the domain of science [19], [20], few studies have analyzed how inquiry-based learning can be applied to computer science education, and how different approaches to inquiry may benefit diverse learners. This is one of the first studies to analyze teacher enactment of inquiry-based learning during the implementation of an upper elementary, computational thinking curriculum, and to explore how teacher approaches to inquiry appear to support or constrain multilingual students' development of computational thinking and computer science identities. Design-based research was used to iteratively develop, test, and refine the inquiry-based curriculum, which aligns with computer science and literacy standards, provides linguistic scaffolding, and integrates culturally responsive materials. We adopt a cross-case mixed-methods design to collect data from five teachers and 149 students including detailed field notes, teacher interviews, student computational artifacts, and student identity surveys. Through analyses of teacher moves, we find that teachers adopt different approaches to inquiry that can be indexed along a continuum ranging from open to closed. Patterns in student data revealed that those who received more structured inquiry lessons developed more sophisticated computational artifacts and showed greater identification with the field of computer science. Findings from this study are being used to add more structured inquiry approaches to the next iteration of our curriculum, including integrating USE/MODIFY/CREATE models into lessons and applying metacognitive strategies from reading research to students' programming activities.},

  abstract={In the rapidly evolving landscape of education, the cultivation of computational skills and the enhancement of students' intellectual abilities remain of paramount importance. This research paper delves into the innovative approach of leveraging Multiple Intelligence (MI) theory to foster computational skills among high school students. The study specifically focuses on a group of 26 computer science high school students at N azarbayev Intellectual School in Shymkent, Kazakhstan. The research employs a comprehensive and structured methodology that integrates MI principles into the classroom environment. Over a designated timeframe, students participate in a variety of activities designed to engage and stimulate each of their unique intelligences. Language, mathematics, spatial perception, motor skills, music, personal, and intrapersonal communication intelligences are all encompassed in these pursuits., creating a holistic learning experience. Data collection encompasses a multitude of measures, including pre- and post-assessments, observations, and student feedback, to gauge demonstrate the significant improvement in students' computational abilities following the MI-enhanced curriculum. In particular, students displayed increased problem-solving skills, critical thinking, creativity, and adaptability when confronted with computational challenges. The conclusion of this study contribute significant analysis into the potential of MI theory to transform traditional computer science education. By providing a dynamic and inclusive learning environment that nurtures students' diverse intellectual strengths, educators can empower learners to excel in computational disciplines. This research paper encourages further exploration of MI- based strategies to enhance computational abilities and inspires a shift towards more personalized and inspires a shift towards more personalized and effective teaching methodologies.},

Firstly, through a literature review, we delve into the concept and design process of the dual-diamond model while exploring the feasibility of digital technologies. Subsequently, harnessing the characteristics of the dual-diamond design thinking, we embark on the entire design process. During the exploration phase, we gather firsthand user pain points through user interviews, complemented by secondary data from the internet. This aids in constructing user journey maps and user models, defining user segments, and identifying design opportunities. Following this, we proceed with the functional reconstruction and interface prototyping of the smart tourism application, with a focus on features such as automated travel guides, visualized travel itineraries, panoramic guides, personalized travel companion searches, and intelligent user interactions. Conducting empirical design validation, we observed a high level of user satisfaction. Consequently, iterative design improvements were made, serving as a reference for future smart travel service promotion and development, thus advancing the growth of personalized tourism.},

A controlled experiment was performed to validate the course's influence on developing learners' computational thinking, and a questionnaire was employed to examine the experimental class learners' experience with the course. The results found that the level of computational thinking in the experimental class was also significantly different from the pretest, and the students in the experimental class rated each item of the course above 7 points. This indicates that this course has a significant effect on cultivating students' computational thinking, and the learners had a good learning experience and made gains from this course.},

  abstract={This paper describes a learning activity on computational thinking in ethics classroom with compulsory secondary school students (14-16 years old). It is based on the assumption that computational thinking (or better “logical thinking”) is applicable not only to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics subjects but to any other field in education, and it is particularly suited for decision making in moral dilemmas. This will be carried out through the study of so called “moral machines," using a game-based learning approach on self-driving vehicles and the need to program such cars to perform certain behavior's under extreme situations. Students will be asked to logically base their reasoning on different ethical approaches and try to develop a schema of decision making that could serve to program a machine to respond to those situations. Students will also have to deal with the uncertainty of reaching solutions that will be debatable and not universally accepted as a part of the difficulty, more ethical than technical, to provide machines with the ability to take decisions where there is no such thing as a “right” versus “wrong” answer, and potentially both (or more) of the possible actions will bring unwanted consequences.},

  abstract={In the last years, many didactic activities have been proposed to develop Computational Thinking (CT) skills in children and adolescents. Among these activities, the digital game programming stands out as a promising alternative considering that it is related to a familiar and motivating context for students. These initiatives are not specifically aimed at individuals with special needs such as the autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Children and adolescents with ASD usually have some limitations related to communication, cognitive flexibility, and interpersonal relationships. However, it seems natural that the skills potentially developed through game programming activities are especially beneficial for the public with ASD. In this paper, we describe the offering and evaluation of a Game Building Workshop adapted to adolescents with this condition. The guidelines used to define the workshop activities are described. An assessment based on the classroom observation and analysis of produced artifacts indicate that the participants acquired CT skills related to programming at a high level. In addition, the collaborative nature of the activities offered a stimulating and welcoming environment for individuals with ASD.},

  abstract={This paper focuses on game development using Mixed Reality technology, the Magic Leap One device, by exploring with The Lab and Unreal Engine program that are developed in game interpolating Computational Thinking (CT). The research device focuses on integrating thinking skills into 3D games with real-time user interaction. From mixed reality (MR) the application of technology is evaluated in its use for learning effectiveness. The game aims to promote a computational thinking process based on the terms and conditions within 5 levels as well as the complexity of the game with more obstacles in each level as the character travels from beginning to destination. Commands provide for different contexts. Major goal is using mixed reality technology to advance convergence in computing education and training in computational thinking (CT) to help players strengthen their thinking process and CT through the game. This game can be an alternative learning medium for the educator in primary school (Grade 4–6). The assessment of target users 10–15 persons before and after the game tests have 3 aspects in technology, CT, and usability of game performance. An expert evaluation was conducted after the test. Assessment of the overall game focuses on building of CT skill within the game relative to project objectives. Evaluation results were 77.8% by users and 88.6% by the expert. Furthermore, some useful suggestions from assessment suggest adding workshop guidelines for educators or trainers. Thus, this project contributes to the computing education community by using available cutting-edge technology as an optional teaching tool in CT that suits learners in education at the primary level and looks toward future development for higher education.},

  abstract={While specialized knowledge and skills are the hallmark of modern society, the size and complexity of contemporary problems often require cooperative effort to analyze and solve. Therefore, experiences with skills, methodologies, and tools for effective interdisciplinary collaboration and structured problem solving are vital for preparing students for future academic and professional success. Meanwhile, computational systems have permeated much of modern professional and personal life, making computational thinking an essential skill for members of modern society. However, formal training in these techniques is primarily limited to students within computer science, mathematics, management of information systems, and engineering. At Iowa State University, we have designed and offered an experimental course to develop undergraduate students' abilities for interdisciplinary teamwork and to disseminate computational thinking skills to a broader range of students. This novel course was jointly designed and instructed by faculty from the Computer Science Department, Gerontology Program, and Graphic Design Program to incorporate diverse faculty expertise and pedagogical approaches. Students were required to interview real users to identify real-life problems, gather requirements, and assess candidate solutions, which necessitated communication both within the group and with technologically-disinclined users. In-class presentations and wiki-based project websites provided regular practice at disseminating domain expertise to larger interdisciplinary audiences. Workshops, group-based mentoring, peer learning, and guided discovery allowed non-CS majors to learn much more about computer programs and tools, and grading criteria held students individually accountable within their disciplines but also emphasized group collaboration},

  abstract={Until now, significant R&D effort in the field of Computational Creativity, has been devoted towards understudying the elements of the creative process from idea conception to production, or towards designing machines which exhibit human level creativity without merely mimicking the human creative process. However, in the effort to determine if an artefact is creative by human standards, it is also important to examine the perception of creativity by humans and to which extend this perception can be formalized and applied on the evaluation of creative works. In this paper, we investigate how the human perception for creativity exhibited in text artefacts can be predicted using appropriate formulations of computational creativity metrics. To this end, we designed and executed a storytelling experiment assisted by the usage of computational tools. We subsequently exploited human-provided rankings of the stories in order to train a model for evaluating creativity as a combination of various characteristics of the produced stories.},

  abstract={This abstract describes design-based research on building tools that support the development of skills which will allow learners to become producers rather than simply consumers of computational tools. Game creation is an activity which has good potential for learning skills such as multimodal writing and computational thinking skills. Existing tools make the creation of commercial quality games possible, but fall short of fulfilling the potential for skills development. Learner-centred design of a suite of tools which will guide learners towards activities with potential for the desired skills development is underway. Current progress on the design and development of tools is reported and future activities are outlined.},

  abstract={The systematic solutions to planning and scheduling for container terminal logistics systems (CTLS) have been scarce owing to their high complexity and strong randomness. This paper extended the past research on modeling CTLS with computer composition principles and architecture. The comparability and the further mapping relationships between CTLS and multi-processor system-on-chip (MPSoC) were discussed at great length within the theoretical viewpoints of computational thinking. Whereafter a container terminal logistics computational architecture was put forward for scheduling and execution using the perspective of MPSoC, which was established on the conceptual framework and fundamental principles of distributed, parallel, and cooperative computing in essence. Finally, the approach was demonstrated by investigating the stress testing, load balancing and process behavior of a typical container terminal logistics service case in contrast with the previous work based on the comprehensive computational experiments.},

  abstract={Any cognizable thing (object, or idea) can be recognized as a concept, and they are usually described by modality-specific, experience-dependent, or localist-distributed representations. There has been a significant effort in studying concrete concepts, along with their underlying cognitive and psychological processes through conceptual representations produced by computational approaches (like Artificial Neural Networks). However, the notion of abstract concepts, though debated, is seldom explored. In this article, we propose an approach to learn abstract representation of concepts with Regulated Activation Networks (RANs) evolving computational modeling. RANs methodology is illustrated using a toydata problem, and evaluated for metrics Precision, Recall, Fl-score, and Accuracy, along with ROC curve analysis. RANs comparison is presented using a benchmark data from human activity recognition domain, yielding Precision= 98.20% (ca.), Recall= 97.62% (ca.), Fl-score= 97.8 (ca.), and Accuracy= 97.62% (ca.). Sleep Detection data from SOCIALITE project is used to model active and inactive students, showing a convincing performance. Further, the model is used in studying 3 students in order to deduce biomarkers for understanding their psychological conditions.},

  abstract={In this paper we present a STEM education initiative. This initiative involves an improved learning approach by means of the implementation of collaborative learning techniques. The proposed approach promotes computational thinking skills in a group manner to improve the learning of geometry. Two case studies were performed with primary school children in the fourth grade at the Comfacor School (Montería-Colombia). The aim of these studies was to analyse the effects of the improved approach in three aspects: the children' motivation, satisfaction and performance. The obtained results provide evidence that the learning of geometry was enhanced thanks to the proposed approach implemented based on a computational thinking strategy.},
