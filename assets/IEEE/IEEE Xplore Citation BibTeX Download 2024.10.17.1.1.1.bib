  abstract={Food processing demands a considerable and continuous energy supply and the rise in the price of electricity in South Africa has put much pressure on the industry. This has forced a re-think and development of alternative energy efficiency technology. In South Africa's cold storage chain the entire refrigeration system is among the most energy-intensive areas, but also offers opportunity for short and long term saving. It also provides an opportunity for enhancement of sustainable development and cold chain management. This paper presents a combination of three efficient technologies in those areas: (1) Airflow pattern optimisation through a computer assisted simulation model in which overall energy efficiency of cooling facilities is dependent not only on the energy generation efficiency of the refrigeration system, but also utilisation efficiency of all cooling facilities. Optimal airflow pattern of a cold room would move heat effectively to a refrigeration system, hence increasing both energy efficiency and refrigeration distribution. (2) Variable speed drive (VSDs) technology on evaporator fans motors: VSDs reduce motor electricity consumption by 30-60%; other benefits include prolonging equipment life through motor speed adjustments according to load. (3) Minimising heat transmission load by heat conduction transfer - coloured and shaded external walls being a major factor. Such technologies saved energy, thus reducing cold chain facilities' demand. The system was also cost-efficient and, inter-alia, research detailed in this paper contributed towards alleviating South Africa's energy problems.},

  abstract={A very interesting and promising numerical method of solving systems of ordinary differential equations based on Taylor series has appeared. The potential of the Taylor series has been exposed by many practical experiments and a way of detection and solution of large systems of ordinary differential equations has been found. Generally speaking, a stiff system contains several components, some of them are heavily suppressed while the rest remain almost unchanged. This feature forces the used method to choose an extremely small integration step and the progress of the computation may become very slow. There are many (implicit) methods for solving stiff systems of ODE’s, from the most simple such as implicit Euler method to more sophisticated (implicit Runge-Kutta methods) and finally the general linear methods. Usually a quite complicated auxiliary system of equations has to be solved in each step. These facts lead to immense amount of work to be done in each step of the computation. These are the reasons why one has to think twice before using the stiff solver and to decide between the stiff and non-stiff solver.},

  pages={25-28},
  abstract={College counselors are an important part of the faculty of colleges and universities, the backbone of the ideological and political education of college students, and the main force in the work of college students. The 21st century we live in is a highly intelligent era. With the continuous emergence of intelligent computing as a typical technical means in contemporary network technology, the relationship between intelligent computing and people&#x0027;s life and work is getting closer and closer. However, college counselors are also facing many new problems and challenges. Therefore, how to improve the use of intelligent computing and better improve the competence of counselors has become a difficult problem for colleges and universities. Based on this, this article launched a research on the competency training ability of college counselors based on intelligent computing. This article uses behavioral incident interview method, literature analysis method and questionnaire survey method to carry out research. Through interviews with counselors, the competency characteristics of counselors are obtained, and the competency model of counselors is established. By consulting the literature, compiling questionnaires, designing a complete set of questionnaires in line with the research, and issuing questionnaires to 60&#x0025; of college counselors and teachers to obtain the most authentic data. Collect relevant data through questionnaire surveys, and then enter the collected data into the database for data analysis. By consulting related materials, using publicly published papers and works at home and abroad as references, we can obtain basic theoretical support and background materials, as well as the current status and development level of the research on the competence of counselors. The survey results show that counselors have a strong understanding of work. Generally, 45&#x0025; are familiar with them, 18&#x0025; are relatively familiar, and few are very familiar. 40&#x0025; of counselors think they have average competence. 44 &#x0025; of counselors voluntarily signed up and wanted to participate in training to improve themselves. 51&#x0025; of counselors believe that the best time for a training session is half a day. Regarding the training goals, only a small number of instructors have clear training goals. It can be seen that the research on the competence training ability of college counselors is of extremely high value.},

  abstract={This paper presents a comprehensive model of smart and collaborative last mile supply networks. Facing a multitude of challenges such as economic pressure, demographic change, and environmental demands, urban last mile supply networks are increasingly strained. Various solutions and strategies such as the integration of novel technologies and collaborative approaches are discussed in the literature and tested in case studies. The application of artificial intelligence for supply networks holds potential for future urban logistics optimization and is thus considered a relevant research avenue. A design science approach comprising system dynamics-based modeling is chosen due to last mile networks' inherent complexity. Systems thinking has proven to be useful in urban logistics and smart city research contexts as it enables researchers and practitioners to achieve a more holistic perspective. The proposed model contributes to a better understanding of last mile network complexity as well as the underlying interdependencies.},

With this contribution we aim to broaden the discourse on Green AI by investigating the current status of approaches to both environmental assessment and ecodesign of AI systems. We propose a life-cycle-based system thinking approach that accounts for the four key elements of these software-hardware-systems: model, data, server, and cloud. We conduct an exemplary estimation of the carbon footprint of relevant compute hardware and highlight the need to further investigate methods for Green AI and ways to facilitate wide-spread adoption of its principles. We envision that AI could be leveraged to mitigate its own environmental challenges, which we denote as ‘AI4greenAI’.},

  abstract={Suicide has been a prominent cause of death worldwide, regardless of age, sex, geography, and so on, and predominantly suicide among teens, increased as the years have passed. Suicide ideation, suicide risk, suicide attempts have been studied extensively, and the most common cause has been identified as depression, followed by familial concerns, hereditary factors, stress, avoidance fear, and a variety of other variables. When visited by a doctor, most adolescents are unaware of their mental state and hence do not take action on their own or are not assisted by family or peer members to overcome their fear of social stigma or the treatment they must undergo. According to popular belief, early treatment and detection are the most effective ways to reduce the risk of suicide. As a result, the focus of this study is to illustrate some of the computational strategies utilized in deep learning and machine learning fields to detect kids at risk of suicide},

  abstract={Transformer-based deep learning models have become a ubiquitous vehicle to drive a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) related tasks beyond their accuracy ceiling. However, these models also suffer from two pronounced challenges, that is, gigantic model size and prolonged turnaround time. To this end, we introduce E.T. that rE-thinks self-attention computation for Transformer models on GPUs with the following contributions: First, we introduce a novel self-attention architecture, which encompasses two tailored self-attention operators with corresponding sequence length-aware optimizations, and operation reordering optimizations. Second, we present an attention-aware pruning design which judiciously uses various pruning algorithms to reduce more computations hence achieves significantly shorter turnaround time. For the pruning algorithms, we not only revamp the existing pruning algorithms, but also tailor new ones for transformer models. Taken together, we evaluate E.T. across a variety of benchmarks for Transformer, BERTBASE and DistilBERT, where E.T. presents superior performance over the mainstream projects, including the popular Nvidia Enterprise solutions, i.e., TensorRT and FasterTransformer.},

The validity of the developed technology (i.e., the method and its supporting environment) has been assessed through two controlled experiments. In particular, the experiments have been conducted to compare the developed technology with a brainstorming session based on face-to-face interaction. The comparison has been performed with respect to the time needed to model use case diagrams and the quality of the produced models. The data analysis indicates a significant difference in favor of the brainstorming session for the time, with no significant impact on the requirements specification.},

The proposed method is especially suitable for generalized PN classes containing weighted arcs such as S4R and S4PR. It leads to optimal or near-optimal liveness-enforcing supervisors without solving intractable integer linear programming problems. By using a recently proposed optimality test for CPs, the proposed ITGAL method provides improved behavioral permissiveness and/or reduced structural complexity of the CPs.

  abstract={The collection of individuals with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI), is the target audience for the Think to Speak Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) system. The slow communication rate of AACs accessible to the target audience renders them undesirable, exhausting to operate, and a barrier to social and economic inclusion. This research synergizes the use of Electroencephalography (EEG) and high-sensitivity piezoelectric sensor readings with a Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM RNN) to create a physically accessible AAC with performance comparable to 7.8 characters per minute communication rate. Since self-expression is inextricably linked with physical, mental, and emotional health, this research is of great significance to the estimated one percent of the global population with complex communication needs.},

  abstract={Large language models (LLMs) have achieved a great success in natural language processing, and have a significant potential for multi-modal applications. Despite the surprising zero-shot or few-shot ability, it is also required to effectively fine-tune pre-trained language models for specific downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce CaptionT5, a video captioning model that fine-tunes T5 towards understanding videos and generating descriptive captions. To generate a more corespondent caption, CaptionT5 introduces thought-augmented fine-tuning for video captioning, in which a pre-trained language model is fine-tuned on thought-augmented video inputs. This resembles the process that human see a video, think of visual concepts such as objects and actions, and then tell a correct and natural sentence based on the thoughts. To automatically generate thoughts, we propose (1) CLIP-guided thought sampling that samples thoughts based on the similarity in an image-text multimodal embedding space by leveraging CLIP. We also propose (2) CLIP-guided caption ranking during decoding for further performance gains. Through experimentation on VATEX, MSRVTT, and YC2 datasets, we empirically demonstrate that CaptionT5 performs competitively against prior-art video captioning approaches without using encoders specialized for video data. Further experiments show that CaptionT5 is especially effective under small number of sampled video frames.},

  abstract={Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown promising results in traditional downstream tasks. Evaluation studies have emerged to assess their abilities, with the majority focusing on the third-person perspective, and only a few addressing specific tasks from the first-person per-spective. However, the capability of VLMs to “think” from a first-person perspective, a crucial attribute for advancing autonomous agents and robotics, remains largely unexplored. To bridge this research gap, we introduce EgoThink, a novel visual question-answering benchmark that encompasses six core capabilities with twelve detailed dimensions. The benchmark is constructed using selected clips from ego-centric videos, with manually annotated question-answer pairs containing first-person information. To comprehensively assess VLMs, we evaluate twenty-one popular VLMs on EgoThink. Moreover, given the open-ended format of the answers, we use GPT-4 as the automatic judge to compute single-answer grading. Experimental results indicate that although GPT-4V leads in numerous dimensions, all evaluated VLMs still possess considerable potential for improvement in first-person perspective tasks. Meanwhile, enlarging the number of trainable parameters has the most significant impact on model performance on EgoThink. In conclusion, EgoThink serves as a valuable addition to existing evaluation benchmarks for VLMs, providing an indispensable resource for future research in the realm of embodied artificial intelligence and robotics.},
