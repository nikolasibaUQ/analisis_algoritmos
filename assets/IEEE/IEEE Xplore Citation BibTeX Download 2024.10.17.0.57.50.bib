  abstract={The educational system's trajectory has shifted dramatically in recent years. The introduction of chatbots and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques has mostly pushed the trend. Fundamentally, these methods are intended to improve the culture and experience of teaching and learning. However, there are risks associated with these technologies. The risks of using AI chatbots in the education of future engineering graduates are severely examined in this systematic review. This review identifies and addresses pedagogical, ethical, technological, and socio-cultural dangers that may come from the widespread use of AI chatbots based on an intensive review of the available research. The findings provide useful insights for educators, institutions, and policymakers as they manage the hurdles of implementing AI chatbots in engineering education responsibly.},

  abstract={Due to the limited data transmission capability, most of the sensor nodes in the wireless sensor networks(WSN) cannot send data to the base station directly. In most situations the data transfer has to be done by the means of multi-hop. Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy(LEACH) is one of the most widely used multi-hop strategies. However, as there are many random factors interrelated with each other in the networks, it's very difficult to evaluate the network performance for LEACH, which has become a hotpot of current research. Since lifetime is the most important network performance indicator, this paper collects the network operation parameters including working period through multi-agent simulation and computational experiments, and evaluates the network performance in different situations based on the collected data. The results would provide practical advices for optimizing the network performance and come up with a new thinking of adopting multi-agent simulation in WSN research.},

  year={2015},

  pages={68-71},
  abstract={Common cardiovascular diseases like heart attack and stroke are the major cause of mortality and disability in recent decades. Increased blood viscosity is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Elevated blood viscosity is associated with atherosclerosis and its growth. The knowledge of the arterial hemodynamics resulted due to atherosclerosis with different level of blood viscosity can clarify the relationship between artery stenosis and symptoms, and, finally, the risk of heart attack and stroke. Hence proficient imaging of blood flow has great clinical importance to understand the origin and evolution of disease. Therefore, investigation and detection of viscosity change and its effect might be helpful for better diagnosis of carotid atherosclerosis. In this simulation work, hemo-disturbances are studied in a carotid artery finite element model (FEM) with atherosclerosis under different viscosities consideration using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The obtained FEM data are used to reconstruct color flow image of blood velocities using ultrasound radio-frequency (RF) signals to study atherosclerosis detecting the viscosity changes. The findings of this study suggest that ultrasound based blood flow image can detect the viscosity change effect related to atherosclerosis growth. We think the findings will be helpful to develop effective ultrasound imaging technique for atherosclerosis diagnosis.},

  abstract={The ability to think has been one of the most fascinating features of robots in science fiction since the introduction of the word 'robot' by Karel Capek in his Czech science fiction play, known as 'Rossum's Universal Robots' in English [1]. Since Capek's first depiction in 1921, science fictionists generally portray robots as intelligent humanoid machines that are subservient to humans. Android is another term used for such robots in modern linguistics. However, the development of robots with the ability to think has largely been a fantasy for robot scientists and engineers. Nevertheless, the evolution of robots has come a long way since the first industrial robot 'Unimate' in 1954. Robots have transformed from large automated manufacturing facilities to applications in our homes and even into our pockets as software robots in our PDAs and smart phones [2], [3]. This paper classifies robot intelligence into six categories: cognitive intelligence, social intelligence, behavioral intelligence, ambient intelligence, collective intelligence and genetic intelligence. This classification categorizes the intelligence of robots based on the different aspects of awareness and the ability to act deliberately as a result of such awareness.},

  abstract={The research projects our investigations have spawned span topics in attack modeling, quantifying the effects of attacks on network performance and robustness, and the construction of computational tools for managing our simulation experiments. We hope, however, that our work's meta-contribution is to show, by proof of concept, that you must consider simple, sideways system attacks before you can rely on a system. We encourage engineers of mission-critical systems to look for then cavemen (or squirrels) and to study carefully what actions these adversaries might take against the products they roll out. In this paper we examine simple attacks on routing protocols for wireless networks. In our study, the system was to be a wireless ad hoc network, a collection of independent, possibly mobile computing devices that communicate using radio frequency technology.},

  title={What Should “Industry 4.0” Differ from Previous Industrial Revolutions?}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-1},
  abstract={During 2016-19, the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) funded the “Connect Everything: Industrial Systems in the Digital Age” programme (£ 1m) and adopted the German-initiated term “Industry 4.0” for the coming a priori “industrial revolution”. As part of this programme, University of Glasgow hosted the EPSRC’s first conference on this topic - “Looking Beyond Industry 4.0”. The success of this programme led to another round of £ 1m funding for “Connected Everything II: Accelerating Digital Manufacturing Research Collaboration and Innovation” (2019-22), so as “to make the most of this fourth industrial revolution”. The first three Industrial Revolutions took place a posteriori, and mostly, were concerned with assisting and liberating humans from physical labour. Today, should the a priori Industry 4.0 differ from the previous industrial revolutions? If so, would the difference be in a focus on assisting and liberating humans from mental labour for the first time? The recent World Economic Forum highlighted four main design principles of this revolution: (1) Interoperability, (2) Information transparency, (3) Cognitive and physical assistance (4) Decentralised decisions and actions. Coinciding with this wave of revolution is the third wave of artificial intelligence (AI), which is currently in its earnest resurgence. It is now possible to develop computational AI technology to surpass a human designer in innovation and creativity, just like AlphaGo Zero in London to have surpassed AlphaGo and humans in Go playing. The progress of science and technology now heavily relies on simulation-based ‘third paradigm of science’ in the form of ‘computer-aided design’ (CAD). AI can transform CAD simulations to predictive simulations for ‘computer-automated design’ (CAutoD), which becomes possible through AI with the increased computing power and data. Thus, CAutoD should help Industry 4.0 to achieve mass customisation at a mass production cost in the near future. However, design, manufacturing and service all need to be taken into account for factory-floor innovation in order to deliver transformative improvements in performance, productivity and time-to-market. Commensurate with the ‘intelligent manufacturing’ value chain and ‘market informatics’ at the end of this value chain, such Industry 4.0 would enhance innovation, creativity and competitiveness.},

  abstract={The creation of navigable, geographic art and its interactions is a novel, ideal environment for a computationally creative system. In this paper, we present a system that utilizes a canvas of city blocks to draw paths that represent the mood of the user, or if none is provided, it picks inspiration for itself. By being provided with user mood input, the system then identifies images that represent the provided emotion and, on its own volition, plots a path for the user to traverse. This kind of art is often classified as Strava Art which has been a hobby within online groups as early as 2015. The presented system utilizes techniques for translation and navigation of geodetic data provided by OpenStreetMap, processing images in the knowledge base for geographic display, and error checking through the use of Hausdorff calculations. Through a publicly administered survey, it was demonstrated that the system is effective at generating artifacts that are representative of the selected image.

  abstract={Poetry generation is a branch of text generation that demands a high level of linguistic proficiency and creativity. The Urdu language, renowned for its rich poetic tradition, encompasses a diverse collection of poets, each possessing a unique writing style. This research explores the automatic generation of Urdu poetry, specifically Urdu ghazals which hold a significant cultural value using natural language processing (NLP) techniques including deep learning. The dataset used consists of 17,609 couplets from the works of 15 renowned Urdu ghazal poets. We use three different approaches for poetry generation which include (a) the n-gram probabilistic model, (b) deep learning models such as LSTM and GRU, and (c) the state-of-the-art GPT-2 model. BLEU scores for each of these were (a) 0.5 for the n-gram model, (b) 0.1 for LSTM and GRU and, (c) 0.6 for the GPT-2 model, which was the highest overall score. In addition to the BLEU score, other metrics such as rhyming score and human evaluation were considered for evaluating the generated poetry. This research is the first to use transformer-based models for Urdu poetry generation, which enables aspiring poets to learn from and be inspired by the rich tradition of Urdu poetry.},

  pages={154-159},
  abstract={The human nervous system is the controlling mechanism for coordinating all body-related activities. In the cognitive world, it stimulates thinking capabilities. It prompts a reaction to a particular situation and allows body parts to move. In addition, it also regulates other physiological functions such as digestion and respiration. The nervous system consists of billions of cells which interpret information from sensory elements and translate it into coordinated action performed by various parts of the body. With the increase in age, the steady decline of these cells results in a loss of dopamine compounds. Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by an unforeseen expansion of the movement of bodily extremities that results in this decline. Finding a cure for this disease is still an enormous challenge, and its progression can be slowed by early detection. The proposed work has been implemented with seven machine learning and deep-learning techniques, including decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), logistic regression, naive Bayes, k nearest neighbour, neural network model, and support vector machines for preemptively predicting PD. The model was implemented utilizing a dataset acquired from Kaggle. This included the normal cases as well as those with PD. The findings showed that the random forest model was superior to others, achieving an accuracy of 86.70%. In contrast, the naive Bayes model displayed the lowest accuracy of 71.50%. In addition, both the random forest and support vector machine models showed the highest accuracy levels of 85.90%. Various other performance metrics such as computational time, AUC (the Area Under the Curve), F1-score, ROC curve area, and recall rate were utilized to predict the effectiveness of each technique. Comparative analysis identified that the least performing models are the k-nearest neighbour and naive Bayes methods. In the future, this method can be refined further by using a large dataset and employing deep learning models for higher predictive outcomes.},

  pages={101-108},
  abstract={Using game design and programming to foster computational thinking acquisition has proved to be a successful strategy in recent years. In previous research with AgentSheets, we concluded that the semiotic richness of this visual programming environment, specifically designed to support computational thinking acquisition, could be explored more extensively to the benefit of learners. In particular, we realized that there are some additional representations of AgentSheets games and simulations that are not presented as programming tools in the interface, and yet they communicate new relevant meanings to the users. This paper reports on research where we artificially introduced such representations in a small follow-up experiment with selected participants from our previous research experiment. Our goal was to investigate the impact of such additional representations on program comprehension and modification tasks. To this end we contrasted empirical evidence of their performance in the two tasks with their verbal account of experience with AgentSheets. We used a combination of discourse analysis and inspections using Semiotic Engineering methods and the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework. Our findings go in two directions. First, we observed that additional representations have allowed participants to expand and correct previous learning. Therefore such representations can support new teaching strategies in computational thinking acquisition programs with AgentSheets. Second, we learned that the combination of methods we used to analyze empirical data - discourse analysis with semiotic and cognitive inspection techniques - can be used systematically in other research contexts, holding the promise of insightful results.},

  abstract={Computational thinking education nowadays gets more attention around the world because of its importance. In Indonesia, computational thinking has not received attention as much as in other developed countries. However, there is a community that already focuses on promoting computational thinking to Indonesian students through annual competitions, which is Bebras Indonesia. The problems that are used in the competition also have been adapted into a game. The game aims to help student practicing for the competition, but the game still has several limitations to be used by Indonesian students. Therefore, this paper researches similar games design interaction that suits Indonesian students, particularly for upper elementary school students. The type of the game is a serious game that has the main goal of learning. An approach of user-centered design was used to develop the design interaction. Usability testing was conducted to verify the result of the design interaction in two iterations. The result of the research shows that the design interaction is effective with a score of completion rate of 100% and easy to learn with a score of SEQ 6,37 out of 7. It is also enjoyable for students based on the result of the E-Gameflow questionnaire score of 5,83 out of 7 and an IMI enjoyability score of 5,77 out of 7.},

  abstract={Humans ability to detect lies is no more accurate than chance according to the American Psychological Association. The state-of-the-art deception detection methods, such as deception detection stem from early theories and polygraph have proven to be unreliable. Recent advancement in deception detection includes the application of advanced data analysis and machine learning algorithms. This paper presents a novel deep learning driven multimodal fusion for automated deception detection, incorporating audio cues for the first time along with the visual and textual cues. The critical analysis and comparison of the proposed deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based approach with the state-of-the-art multimodal fusion methods have revealed significant performance improvement up to 96% as compared to the 82% prediction accuracy reported in the recent literature.},

  abstract={Cross site scripting attacks are the most common network attacks nowadays. In order to let the students in higher vocational colleges master the attack and defense skills of cross site scripting, it's essential to let them have the opportunity to truly practice the attacking behaviors as hackers do, and to practice the defense countermeasures as web site administrators do. In this paper, we have developed an attacking and defense lab environment for cross site scripting education in higher vocational colleges. Our experience shows that by using this lab environment, students can better understand what cross site scripting vulnerabilities are, why they occur, how to exploit them and how to fix them. We suggest that a lot more researches need to be done in the area of developing attacking and defense lab environments in order to improve the outcomes of network security education in higher vocational colleges.},

  abstract={The cloud computing grid plays a vital role in the Internet Of Things (IOT) and 5G technologies. It provides a platform through huge data information is communicated efficiently. Also, there are a number of government and financial agencies adopting cloud computing network for data communication. However, the data management, security and privacy on cloud network are a big concern to provide reliable service and secure the sensitive information on the network. In this paper, firstly security attacks on cloud computing is discussed. To countermeasure these attacks, cryptography and steganography techniques are studied and critical analysis is done. The open research area defined on the basis of studies and critical analysis, which helps the other research to contribute their research in this field.},

  abstract={The concept of byzantine attack comes from byzantine generals problem. In this abstract concept, the loyal byzantine army general are suppose to coordinate in a battlefield to conclude a common plan in the presence of traitor generals which can disrupt such coordination. This generals problem resembles the attacks initiated by authenticated nodes/devices in ad hoc network to disrupt the network. Although these attacks can be initiated individually but are more devastating if initiate in a combined way. This paper discusses and highlights the performance degradation of AODV routing protocol, mainly when the byzantine attack are initiated in a combination.},
