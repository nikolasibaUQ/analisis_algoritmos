  abstract={The anticipatory timing control in sensory-motor coupling is indispensable to generate coordinative movement among humans, however its cognitive mechanism still remains obscure. In this study we used synchronization tapping task as a model system, and negative asynchrony phenomenon where the tap onset precedes the stimulus onset was analyzed as an example of the anticipation. Especially, applying dual task method, the relationship between the anticipation mechanism and the higher brain function such as attention and working memory was investigated. The results revealed two types of anticipatory timing control. In the inter stimulus-onset interval (ISI) range of 450 to 1800 ms, automatic anticipation that is not affected by attentional resources was observed and was based on feed forward dynamics. In the 2400 to 3600 ms range, the anticipation showed trade-off relationship in the allocation of attentional resources. Magnitude of synchronization error (SE) between tap onset and stimulus onset in this region was scaled by the ISI and the feed back dynamics concerning ISI was suggested. Accordingly, anticipation in timing control was shown to be a dual processing between the attentional process and the embodied automatic process.},

  abstract={Pattern recognition is one of the fundamental competencies associated with computational thinking and STEM education. Although much has been written to define computational thinking (CT), we argue that CT is a multi-faceted construct and specific aspects of CT (such as pattern recognition) should be examined. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review of literature on pattern recognition to define pattern recognition as an aspect of computational thinking. The synthesis included the Engineering Village database (Compendex and INSPEC). We searched peer reviewed articles and the keywords, pattern recognition, pattern generalization and education. The initial search resulted in 208 articles. The screening of abstracts more closely resulted in 17 relevant articles, which were then read in detail by two researchers. The review of this pool resulted in two relevant articles, one with a focus on mathematics education and the other one in the context of medical education. Surprisingly there were no articles that examined pattern recognition as part of engineering or computer education. Further research examining specific aspects of CT is necessary.},

  title={Making Figures for Class Materials Using KETpic Based on Symbolic Thinking}, 
  year={2011},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={93-101},
  abstract={Many mathematics teachers produce original course materials with figures because their use enables students to comprehend mathematical objects. This paper presents a model for producing effective figures for use in course materials. LaTeX is often used to edit course materials and they often use computer algebra system (CAS) to insert graphical image files into the materials. We developed KETpic as a plug-in based on CAS to insert precise and expressive figures into a LaTeX document. After KETpic generates LaTeX-readable codes, the resultant figure is a monochrome, high-quality line drawing. Consequently, teachers can easily improve the quality of their materials. When they produce a figure using KETpic, they can perform mathematical operations as they consider combinations of KETpic commands as mathematical symbols. We designate this mathematical activity as symbolic thinking. By performing symbolic thinking, they need not be overly concerned about writing a program for CAS. Instead, they can concentrate on consideration of more important matters of cognition such as producing an effective figure. They require an advantageous environment in which they can easily perform symbolic thinking. This paper presents two sufficient conditions for this environment: (i) they produce new KETpic commands as the modularization of mathematical operations that they frequently use, and (ii) they create an original package of new KETpic commands. In this paper, we present some examples for these propositions using KETpic based on Scilab.},

  abstract={In this paper we show that, when dealing with genetic structures of cognition, Piaget's approach is the most convenient algebraic form of logic structure to use and which classical logic can be derived from. But the formal rationality provided by the derived “semantic squares” is not spontaneous at rational level, and therefore, should not be easy to learn for adults. This is the main reason why we need reliable and effective training tools to achieve full logic and predicative proficiency, like the Elementary Pragmatic Model (EPM). We present the basic considerations towards the development of computational, intelligent tutoring system (ITS), taking in focus the computational model for current reasoning fallacies based on Piaget-Klein Fourgroup and related EPM training tool to achieve predicative proficiency. EPM and ITS can also contribute to AI and cognitive informatics, helping to develop autonomous reasoning system for person-centered learning and training to predicative competence and decision making.},

  abstract={This short paper aimed to investigate how young children as little computer engineers learned in an educational robotics project. Student participants were 11 third graders at one public elementary school in Taiwan. The project in an after-school learning program lasted for five weeks. During weekly learning session, each student needed to use one visual block programming called Ozoblockly to design action patterns for their robots (Ozobot). The study adopted a case study methodology to examine the specific learning scenario. The principal researcher used a participant observation method to observe students' learning behaviors, informal after-class interviews to collect students' learning responses, and a portfolio analysis approach to examine students' programming works. The findings showed that students might obtain a basic understanding of a computer engineer after the instructional intervention. Furthermore, some specific learning patterns from young children's programming process were identified.},

  abstract={Presents a scalable algorithm for short-range molecular dynamics which minimizes interprocessor communications at the expense of a modest computational redundancy. The method combines Verlet neighbor lists with coarse-grained cells. Each processing node is associated with a cubic volume of space and the particles it owns are those initially contained in the volume. Data structures for 'own' and 'visitor' particle coordinates are maintained in each node. Visitors are particles owned by one of the 26 neighboring cells but lying within an interaction range of a face. The Verlet neighbor list includes pointers to own-own and own-visitor interactions. To communicate, each of the 26 neighbor cells sends a corresponding block of particle coordinates using message-passing cells. The algorithms has the numerical properties of the standard serial Verlet method and is efficient for hundreds to thousands of particles per node allowing the simulation of large systems with millions of particles. Preliminary results on the new CM-5 supercomputer are described.<>},

  abstract={The IEEE Computer Society Smart Grid Vision Project (CS-SGVP) was chartered to develop Smart Grid visions looking forward as far as 30 years into the future. At the completion of the project it was realized that to address the complexity of a Smart Grid with vast numbers of intelligent connected devices and systems, computational intelligence techniques must move from top-down to the lowest levels of architectures, with interactive cooperation between smart components, each with a level of autonomy. The CS-SGVP team emphasized creative thought leadership and “blue sky” thinking to identify future Smart Grid operational visions and the role of computing to achieve these visions. The CS-SGVP team developed its visions using a three-tiered approach. Architectural concepts describe Smart Grid goals and characteristics, general grid types, as well as computing concepts considered common across grid types. Functional concepts describe how the grid will operate. Technological concepts describe the roles of certain technologies within the Smart Grid. The CS-SGVP expects that over the course of many years, various visions will come to fruition.},

  abstract={The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) first appeared a few decades ago. Today, by the ubiquitous wireless connectivity, the boost of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and the advances in big data analytics, it is safe to say that IoT has evolved to a new concept called the Internet of Everything (IoE) or the Internet of All. IoE has four pillars, things, human, data, and processes, which render it as an inhomogeneous large-scale network. A crucial challenge of such a network is to develop management, analysis, and optimization policies that besides utility-maximizer machines, also take irrational humans into account. We discuss several networking applications in which appropriate modeling of human decision-making is vital. We then provide a brief review of computational models of human decision-making. Based on one such model, we develop a solution for a task offloading problem in fog computing and we analyze the implications of including humans in the loop.},

  pages={329-339},
  abstract={Meditation has been shown to aid with the management of affective disorders through improving emotion regulation. Here we begin to develop a theory of meditation by creating a computational cognitive model of focused attention meditation. Our model was created within Prims, a derivative of the ACT-R cognitive architecture. We implemented a model based on an extensive literature review of how the meditation experience unfolds over time. We then tested the Prims model in a sustained attention task, intending to capture a faculty that may be trained with meditation practice. The model was significantly better able to maintain focus after the meditation practice than before. These results agree qualitatively with empirical findings of a longitudinal study on the effects of meditation conducted in 2010. The central mechanism for increasing task relevant focus in the model seems to be a feedback loop. The meditation and mind-wandering processes reinforce themselves and weaken the other. However, this reinforcement is more dispersed in the more elaborate mind-wandering process, which causes it to decrease over time. We speculate that observed improvements in emotion regulation observed after meditation arise from the ability to maintain focus, because it allows the practitioner to avoid emotions spiraling out of control.},

  abstract={Opponent Modelling tries to predict the future actions of opponents, and is required to perform well in multiplayer games. There is a deep literature on learning an opponent model, but much less on how accurate such models must be to be useful. We investigate the sensitivity of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a Rolling Horizon Evolutionary Algorithm (RHEA) to the accuracy of their modelling of the opponent in a simple Real-Time Strategy game. We find that in this domain RHEA is much more sensitive to the accuracy of an opponent model than MCTS. MCTS generally does better even with an inaccurate model, while this will degrade RHEA's performance. We show that faced with an unknown opponent and a low computational budget it is better not to use any explicit model with RHEA, and to model the opponent's actions within the tree as part of the MCTS algorithm.},

State mapping criterion and n-best candidates are investigated, and different numbers of Gaussian mixtures of the auxiliary acoustic model are compared based on a grammar-constrained speech recognition system. Using this bilingual model modification approach, compared to the nonnative acoustic model which has already been well trained by adaptation technique MAP, the Phrase Error Rate further achieves a 5.83% relative reduction, while only a small relative increase on Real Time Factor occurs.},

  abstract={Systems thinking approaches are employed to construct a formal decision making methodology for equitably allocating water among competing users in a river basin when taking into account both the societal and physical systems aspects of the allocation problem. In particular, within the societal component of the decision problem, multiple participants, their multiple objectives, equity principles, and economic factors are considered, while the physical systems part reflects relevant hydrologic and environmental factors. The Cooperative Water Allocation Model (CWAM) incorporates these societal and physical systems concerns within the framework of a large-scale optimization program which is divided into two main steps. Firstly, water is allocated among users based on existing legal water rights regimes or agreements. Secondly, water and associated benefits are reallocated among stakeholders to maximize basin-wide welfare. CWAM is applied to the South Saskatchewan River Basin located in the Canadian province of Alberta to demonstrate how it can be conveniently applied to a water allocation system of systems problem.},

  abstract={The flipped classroom model is gaining increasing attention in higher education, including engineering education. There are various types of models and contexts in which they are applied. Generalized research on the effectiveness of the flipped classroom is emerging, and results have been mixed. One such model is team-based learning (TBL) as originally developed by Larry Michaelsen in the late 1970s. TBL is a structured way to implement a flipped classroom approach, and has been shown to be successful in achieving deeper learning among the students. In this paper, we discuss our experience using the TBL methodology in a graduate computer engineering course on system level design of embedded systems. Specifically, we describe the course design, instructor experience adapting TBL for use in the course, including implementing an asynchronous online TBL process, and instructor reflections and student feedback on what worked well and what did not. We analyze the course content using the Florida Taxonomy of Cognitive Behavior, and assess the effectiveness of our implementation in achieving deeper learning. Additionally, we report on student perception of the new course structure and their experience using TBL.},

  abstract={As the power of computational grids increases, there is a corresponding need for better usability in PSE community. In this paper, we describe our experiences on design of project GridPSi, a grid-enabled PSE for physical simulation. GridPSi provides a rich suite of functions that facilitate the composition of computational scripts to automate physical simulations by design domain-specific templates for a verity of research fields. The generic functionality provided by it includes problem modeling, mesh file conversion, computational script generation, solution scheme specification and access to grid resources. GridPSi offers a simple interface that is intuitive to users in the human-PSE interactions and ways of thinking. Furthermore, we developed higher-level graphical components named PDE wizards that build upon the core functions to guide users through problem modeling process with minimum effort. By using Unicore as grid middleware, we are lowering the barriers to entry for users wishing to exploit grid technologies},

  abstract={Computer science is becoming ever increasingly important to our society. Computer science content has, however, not traditionally been considered a natural part of curricula for primary and secondary education. Computer science has traditionally been primarily a university level discipline and there are no widely accepted general standards for what computer science at K-12 level entails. Also, as the interest in this area is rather new, the amount of research conducted in the field is still limited. In this paper we review how 10 different countries have approached introducing computer science into their K-12 education. The countries are Australia, England, Estonia, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, South Korea, Poland and USA. The studied countries either emphasize digital competencies together with programming or the broader subject of computer science or computing. Computational thinking is rarely mentioned explicitly, but the ideas are often included in some form. The most common model is to make computer science content compulsory in primary school and elective in secondary school. A few countries have made it compulsory in both, while some countries have only introduced it in secondary school.},

  abstract={This paper explores the activity of coding with smart toy robots Dash and Botley as a part of playful learning in the Finnish early education context. The findings of our study demonstrate how coding with the two toy robots was approached, conducted and played by Finnish preschoolers aged 5-6 years. The main conclusion of the study is that preschoolers used the toy robots with affordances related to coding mainly in developing gamified play around them by designing tracks for the toys, programming the toys to solve obstacle paths, and competing in player-generated contests of dexterity, speed and physically mobile play.},
