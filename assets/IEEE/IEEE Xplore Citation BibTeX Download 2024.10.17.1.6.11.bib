  title={Quantum Pythagorean Fuzzy Evidence Theory: A Negation of Quantum Mass Function View}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={30},
  number={5},
  pages={1313-1327},
  abstract={Dempster–Shafer (D-S) evidence theory is an effective methodology to handle unknown and imprecise information because it can assign probability into the power set. However, the process of obtaining information is a complex task, which can consider the rational, conscious, objective evaluation of utility with behavioral effects. Besides, in most cases, information can be obtained from different angles at the same time. The quantum model of mass function (QM) uses amplitude and phase angle to easily express those properties of information that can extend D-S evidence theory to the unit circle in a complex plane. Moreover, everything in nature will have its opposite, which is a kind of universality. The Bayes theorem is essentially the process of negation. However, in most cases, decisions can be made by only fully considering the known information without considering the other side of the information. Hence, considering the negation of information is a question to be investigated deeply, which can analyze information from the other point. This article proposes negation of QM by using the subtraction of vectors in the unit circle, which can degenerate into negation proposed by Yager in standard probability theory and negation proposed by Yin et al. in D-S evidence theory. Negation can provide us more information to consider the problem from both positive and negative aspects. In this article, negation can be understood information, which does not belong to event $A$, that is to say, negation can be regarded as nonmembership by using the fuzzy terms. Based on the above discussion, this article proposes the quantum pythagorean fuzzy evidence theory (QPFET), which is the novel work to consider QPFET from the point of negation. Besides, there are some numerical examples to explain the proposed method. In order to explore the applications of QPFET, this article discusses the possibility of the VI $\check{s}$ ekriterijumsko Kompromisno Rangiranje method under QPFET to handle multicriteria decision-making that enables us to capture 2-D data, considering not only amplitude but also phase angle.},

  title={Two-Stage Learning Based Fuzzy Cognitive Maps Reduction Approach}, 
  year={2018},
  volume={26},
  number={5},
  pages={2938-2952},
  abstract={In this study, a new two-stage learning based reduction approach for fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) is introduced in order to reduce the number of concepts. FCM is a graphical modeling technique that follows a reasoning approach similar to the human reasoning and the decision-making process. The FCM model incorporates the available knowledge and expertise in the form of concepts and in the direction and strength of the interactions among concepts. One of the modeling problems of FCMs is that oversized FCM models suffer from interpretability problems. An oversized FCM may contain concepts that are semantically similar and affect the other concepts in a similar way. This new study introduces a two-stage model reduction approach, and both static and dynamic analyses are considered without losing essential information. In the first stage, the number of concepts is reduced by merging similar concepts into clusters, whereas in the second stage the transformation function parameters of concepts are optimized. In order to show the benefit of using the proposed reduction approach, two sets of studies are conducted. First, a huge set of synthetic FCMs are generated, and the results of these statistical analyses are presented via various tables and figures. Subsequently, suggestions to the decision makers are given. Second, experimental studies are also presented to show the decision parameters and procedure for the proposed approach. The results show that after using the concept reduction approach presented in this study, the interpretability of FCM increases with an acceptable amount of information loss in the output concepts.},

  year={2021},
  volume={29},
  number={6},
  pages={1695-1700},
  abstract={Induced ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operators are important extensions of OWA operators and can suit more different decision environments. However, when practitioners perform induced OWA operators, they frequently do not consider the tied values in inducing information, therein lay the problem of possible non-uniqueness of aggregation results. From a novel perspective that can easily remove this flaw, this study uses a systematical frame to better redefine induced OWA operators, which not only covers all the spirits of the original definition of induced OWA operator but also extends it to some wider understandings and usages. One significant feature related to this frame is that we can express induced OWA operators fully in terms of weighted averaging operators, making the usages and expressions of induced OWA operators much more flexible and stricter. In detail, we propose several new definitions, such as positioning transformation, permutation-based orness, and inducing function based orness. As an example of flexibly formulating complex preferences under the proposed concepts, a novel investigators-consultants-decision maker (ICD) two-stage IOWA evaluation model is clearly proposed and illustrated.},

  year={2020},
  volume={28},
  number={12},
  pages={3376-3390},
  abstract={Fuzzy knowledge representation and reasoning is one of the key research subjects of artificial intelligence with uncertainty. Currently, fuzzy Petri nets (FPNs) cannot describe fuzzy nondeterministic knowledge based on the variable fuzzy criterion clearly. To solve this problem, we present an extended FPN model based on the qualitative mapping and the qualitative criterion transformation. First, the mechanism and the principles of the variable fuzzy criterion under qualitative mapping are introduced. The important theoretical basis of qualitative mapping is detection and integration of perceptual attribute features. Under transition degree function and the qualitative criterion transformation, the qualitative mapping better reflects the cases in which the fuzzy membership criterion is variable. Second, we use the characteristics of the qualitative mapping to propose a structure of attribute fuzzy information granule. Based on the logic operation of fuzzy information granule, we redescribe the four fuzzy production rules which are commonly used, and obtain four kinds of fuzzy qualitative judgment rules. They can explicitly express the occurrence process of transition nodes of FPNs, which strengthens the uncertain knowledge representation ability of FPNs. The new method makes it easy to construct a learning mechanism based on cognition in FPNs.},

  abstract={Economy of Bangladesh mostly depended on agriculture. As a small country, our population is over the limit. We are also a developing country also. For national GDP growth must be to increase the production. Every year a huge amount of agricultural production losses for the crop disease. As we know most of the farmers in our country are illiterate, have no proper knowledge about the disease, that's why they cannot manually detect the disease. I think if you properly detect the disease at the early stage we can solve the issue. We develop a model that can classify leaf disease. We focus on 5 major production crops in Bangladesh. Using computer vision technique our farmer will get the benefit. We use convolutional neural networks for classifying images. An algorithm cannot properly capture the features of existing data that's why we use a pre-trained feature extraction method that is MobileNetv2. MobileNetv2 is very useful for mobile devices. The research contains the proportions of validation accuracy of 90.38%. This approach resulted in the agriculture sector that will help a farmer to classify disease from harvest. The main goal of our model is to minimize the damage of suffering plants that can help to the growth of production. By solving this issue themselves farmers can also reduce cost. Our goal is that they can cure their crop at the right time. To achieve this goal we tend to think that we should develop a way to detect the leaf disease. We collect several kinds of cucumber leaves. And then any leave can be tasted by our model. By using our model we try to reduce the leaf disease.},

  abstract={In systems synthesis the basic lesson-and the hardest to accept-is that not all engineering problems can be or should be solved by deduction from mathematical and scientific principles. Synthesis is provisional and qualitative, a way of thinking different from the definitive, quantitative thinking of analysis. Its technique and tools reflect this difference. In synthesizing the system's initial concept, three qualitative techniques are fundamental: heuristics, metaphors, and models. Heuristics are brief statements of lessons learned in the past and applicable to the present situation. Metaphors transpose the implicit behavior of a system to a more familiar context, one example is the desktop metaphor for personal computer operating systems. Models are used to present different perspectives of a proposed system to multiple stakeholders so that everyone has a common frame of reference for discussion. Progressive modeling emphasizes the continuing refinement of models during system development than, say, an initial sketch to full-scale simulator. Each of these qualitative techniques are discussed.},

  abstract={In the past few years, software engineering has witnessed two major shifts: model-driven engineering has entered the mainstream, and some leading development tools have become open and extensible. AI has provided new ideas to software engineering, but most of its gems stayed buried in the laboratories, available only to a limited number of AI practitioners. Should AI tools be integrated into mainstream tools? And can this be done? We think it is feasible and that both communities can benefit from this integration. In fact, some efforts in this direction have already taken place, both from major industrial standardization bodies such as OMG and from academic laboratories. The example presented here should inspire readers to think about integrating their work with mainstream tools.},

Precision timing, gravity sensors and imagers, cryptography, navigation, metrology, energy harvesting and recovery, biomedical sensors and imagers, and real-time optimisers all indicate the potential for quantum technologies to provide the basis of a technological revolution. From the field of Systems Engineering emerges a focused strategy for the development cycle, enabling the existence of hugely complex products. It is through the adoption of systems thinking that the semiconductor industry has achieved massive industrial and economic impact. Quantum technologies rely on delicate, non-local and/or entangled degrees of freedom - leading to great potential, but also posing new challenges to the development of products and industries. We discuss some of the challenges and opportunities regarding the implementation of Systems Engineering and systems thinking into the quantum technologies space.},

The results show that the DSASL can correct the students’ misconceptions and enhance their concept understandings. However, there are individual differences in students’ learning effects when learning with DSASL. Finally, the researchers analyze the transcripts of think-aloud and find that the learning process may influence the students' learning effects.},

  abstract={The term "personality" refers to the combination of characteristics and attributes that contribute to an individual’s distinct personality, such as thinking, emotion, and behavior. Texts on social networking sites can automatically detect an individual’s personality qualities. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) dataset is being used in our research paper, consisting of 16 categories of postings with an amount of 8675 posts. We classified four personality traits from the input text, namely Introversion-Extroversion (I-E), Intuitions-Sensing (N-S), Feeling-Thinking (F-T), and Judging-Perceiving (J-P). We have initially adopted several preprocessing techniques to fit these text data into our proposed machine learning model. Text preprocessing methods include tokenization, word stemming, stop words deletion. After preprocessing, features like tf-idf and countvector were extracted. The model was then trained with six state-of-the-arts classifiers. After evaluating the model, it was found that the SVM outperformed all other classifiers and proved better than the other existing works also.},

The model of cognition currently includes five components thinking processes, organizational strategy, design cohesion, skill mastery, and path of program development. Together these components seek to support six strategies of metacognition, metacognitive scaffolding, reflective prompts, self-assessment, self-questioning, self-directed learning, and graphic organizers. This paper focuses on the implementation and integration of the first two components of the model, thinking processes and organizational strategies into a web application. Together these components integrate Writing-To-Learn and literate programming paradigms to allow the Archimedes application to assess introductory programming students' current level of metacognition and provide automated feedback and allow them to self-monitor, self-assess and improve self-efficacy through the development of strategic knowledge for solving real-world programming problems.},

  abstract={This paper presents a prototype of a distributed training simulator for a surface-to-air missile system. Since the system requirement enforces us to choose an open standard platform, and we think that Java has matured enough to offer acceptable performance and reliability, we decide to implement it by Java. Basically, this training simulator is a distributed interactive application, and lots of messages are exchanged within it. For the performance reason, we use an IP-multicast-based Java message service (JMS) implementation as the communication infrastructure for delivering time-critical events. In this paper, we present how to exploit the capability of the JMS publish/subscribe paradigm to implement this training simulator. Besides, we also perform a set of experiments to test and verify whether the training simulator can meet the system requirement. We think the experience of this paper is a good case study of using Java and message-oriented middleware to build message-intensive distributed systems.},

  abstract={At present, landscape design teaching in design art education has received much attention. With the continuous development of social economy, science and technology and information network technology, traditional landscape design has also achieved a "quality" leap. The appropriate use of computer-aided software in landscape design has become an essential skill for landscape designers. Computer-aided software is like a pen in your hand, a tool that shows the designer's ideas and thinking. How to make students master computer-aided design software and use it reasonably in landscape design is a problem that current landscape design teachers need to think about and study. The existing CAD software for garden landscapes has limited expression of 3D models and virtual simulation effects, and can only be used for 2D construction drawing. In order to solve the dynamic landscape characteristics, a three-dimensional landscape design simulation system of virtual reality technology was developed. Object-oriented parametric 3D solid modeling method was used to realize 3D solid modeling, 3D real-time virtual rendering of design scenes, renderings and animations. Production, construction drawing and other functions, and explored the system computing principles, implementation methods and OpenGL extensions and other related technologies. Then the overall function of the system is briefly introduced, and the simulation process in the professional module is discussed in detail. Finally, the effectiveness of the system is verified by an engineering example.},

  abstract={All the youngsters, nowadays, are not keen to developing their knowledge. Moreover, the students are easily addicted to mobile phones. So, the performance level decreases and reduces their thinking ability as well technology has grown, all the answers are now available in the internet. If they search since the internet, they get their answers directly but without knowing the base from how it came. Therefore, everyone is trying to reach the upcoming technologies without strong in their basics. Hence, a model is created with the help of toolkit (like courseware, etc.) where the technology behind this is AI. This toolkit (packaged to use with computers) comes up with different subjects (subjects were designed based on the year of study). After a concept is thought to an individual or if a concept is learned individually, this toolkit works as a tester and gives the performance and feedback on the level of their understanding. On analyzing the results, the perspective of each individual is identified. The data is passed to ANN, each level of students is happened and the metrics have shown an efficiency of 94.3%. The result produced for each individual is given to an AI model. According to the perspective of each individual, automatic questions are generated by the AI model to increase their level of knowledge and the way of thinking. It helps every individual to be strong in their concepts and no need for searching the answers for every question. Therefore, it is understood that the proposed model has higher efficiency 95% in training the students and teaching the concepts as well.},

  abstract={Implicit Sentiment Analysis (ISA) is a crucial research area in natural language processing. Inspired by the idea of large language model Chain of Thought(CoT), this paper intro - duces a Sentiment Analysis of Thinking (SAoT) framework. The framework first analyzes the implicit aspects and opinions in the text using common sense and thinking chain capabilities. Then, it reflects on the process of implicit sentiment analysis, and finally, it deduces the polarity of sentiment. The model is evaluated on the SemEval 2014 dataset, consisting of 1120 restaurant reviews and 638 laptop reviews. The experimental results demonstrate that the utilization of the ERNIE-Bot-4+SAoT model yields a notable performance improvement. Specifically, on the restaurant dataset, the F1 score reaches 75.27, accompanied by an ISA score of 66.29. Similarly, on the computer dataset, the F1 score achieves 76.50, while the ISA score amounts to 73.46. Comparatively, the ERNIE- Bot-4+SAoT model surpasses the BERTAsp +SCAPT baseline by an average margin of 47.99%.},

  abstract={Discusses how to train computer graphics-oriented students to be able to use the computer to its full artistic potential, with application both of programming and art-related issues. Students create computer art graphics inspired by scientific concepts, to match the curricular content of other courses they are taking concurrently. The integrative visual training involves both the process and the product of the students' work. Due to the integrative instruction of art and science issues, students might learn about specific subject areas by applying visual thinking and inventing subject-related activities which involve visualizing information. Two main methods of integration were applied: (1) integrative project assignments, aimed at provoking the students to apply visual thinking and learning, and (2) art assignments, inspiring the students to create artwork inspired by scientific concepts.},

  year={2024},

  abstract={Recently, many researchers have applied Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) to multi-label learning tasks by establishing relations among labels. However, these researchers have only used GCN as an auxiliary module and have lacked exploration of object relations, which has limited the inference capability of GCN. Applying GCN to multi-label classification in information systems poses significant challenges to address because information systems are considered as a graph with only nodes and no edges. This article proposes a multi-granularity graph convolutional neural network (MG-GCN) based on object relations to enhance the versatility of GCN and demonstrate its reasoning ability. The MG-GCN efficiently solves complex multi-label classification problems in information systems. Firstly, based on the multi-granularity thinking, the attribute set is divided into several attribute subsets based on granularity. Secondly, a graph of differences representing the relationship between objects is established under each attribute subset. Finally, based on the attention mechanism and multiple difference matrices of objects, MG-GCN is proposed and applied to multi-label classification within information systems. The effectiveness and significance of performance of MG-GCN has been verified through ranking-based indicators and hypothesis tests, respectively.},

  abstract={Mobile-edge computing (MEC) system is a new paradigm to provide cloud computing capacities at the edge of radio access network (RAN) which is close to mobile users. In this paper, we aim to promote QoS by offloading the computationally intensive tasks to the MEC server. There are many papers discuss this issue. Nevertheless, most of them just think over one-dimension resource allocation, radio resources or computation resources, and make the MEC system less effective. Hence, we consider the allocation of both radio resources and computation resources of the MEC server to increase system effectiveness. Apart from this, we take the variety of tasks' requirements into account. That is, we assume that different tasks may have different delay requirements. We formulate this problem as a cost minimization problem and design a heuristic algorithm to address it. Numerical results show that our algorithm can greatly promote QoS.},

  abstract={The past 20 years have seen dramatic advances in personality science, both in theory and methodology. Some of these advances reflect a natural but incremental conceptual evolution in a maturing science, but others can be attributed in part to the ever cheaper, more ubiquitous, powerful, and mobile computing. As a result, personality science in the 21st century is a fast-moving field poised to answer important questions across diverse areas, but it is also facing increasingly complex challenges related to assessing and summarizing the important features of human behavior. Computer science and engineering may hold the key to the next advances in personality science. In what is intended to serve as a complement to Vinciarelli and Mohammadi's Survey on Personality Computing , contemporary thinking and research in personality are summarized, the mounting importance of computing in personality research is highlighted, and an outline for future directions in personality computing is offered.},

  abstract={To learn security skills, students and developers must be able to switch from their traditional conditioning to the attacker's way of thinking. Exposure to the hacker culture through hacker conferences such as Defcon and others, Phrack and similar publications, and to comprehensive collections such as Packet Storm helps provide the necessary culture slunk or "a-ha" moment and should be integral to every in-depth security curriculum. Recipes for preventing particular kinds of exploits are only a small part of the value these materials provide. The primary and much underappreciated value of these sources lies in facilitating a deeper understanding of the underlying systems by exposing their designers' implicit assumptions and concentrating the students' and developers' attention on the bigger picture of the system and its environment, especially on issues typically glossed over.},
