  abstract={Summary form only for tutorial. Measuring systems and instruments are becoming more and more complex and are presently capable of performing advanced measurement operations. The recent developments in sensor technology, analog-to-digital converters, and computational capabilities of DSP devices, and the relative simplicity with which these components can be interconnected have opened new possibilities to measurement science and practice. These developments are revealing a number of new issues involving the very fundamentals of the measurement science, from the definition of a new measurement paradigm to the metrological characterization of the measured results. This tutorial is therefore aimed at reconsidering these basic issues, having in mind their application to the modern measuring systems. A model of the measurement process, as a bridge between the empirical world and the world of knowledge and abstract concepts, will be presented. Within this model, the measurement process is only capable of providing incomplete knowledge (the measurement result) about the measurand. It will be shown how an incomplete knowledge about the measurand is still acceptable, provided that we are capable of estimating how incomplete this knowledge is. Starting from this consideration, the methods for characterizing the result of a measurement will be discussed, focusing mainly on the uncertainty, calibration, and traceability concepts. A short survey on the International Metrology Organizations will be also given. After having introduced the basic concept of metrology, a basic instrument diagram will be introduced, and the diagram of the modern systems based on digital signal processing techniques will be discussed in deeper details.},

  abstract={It has been reported that human thoughts processes of sensory-motor functions as well as high level of cognitive processes may be highly reproducible between multiple trials as measured via functional MRI data. This trend of the reproducibility seems consistent between multiple subjects as well. We have also presented in our earlier study that six distinct thought processes were shown highly consistent spatial patterns of activations as evaluated from automated classification performance. In the present study, this automated classification performance was compared depending on the feature vector selection methods. A general linear model (GLM) was adopted to define a neuronal activity and voxel-based or atlas-based approaches were adopted as feature vector selection methods. The classification results showed superior performance from the voxel-based feature selection method than the atlas-based method. Nonetheless, when multiple atlases were used to defined feature vector elements, the resulting performance was comparable to that of the voxel-based method with greatly reduced computational time.},

  year={2016},
  volume={},

  pages={274-278},
  abstract={In the present paper, an autonomation system based on fuzzy logic is proposed for a steel wire rolling mill to minimize a quality problem related to surface finish. Autonomation is a lean manufacturing concept that integrates automation with a human factor. The ability of self-diagnosis is achieved in the automated line by incorporating a computational intelligence tool like fuzzy logic. The decision support model proposed here provides intelligent decisive signals similar to the fuzzy capability of human brain. Fuzzy Logic control (FLC) model is designed to recognize the events that are likely to create defects and output action signals are generated. Speed difference between conveyor rollers and rolled products, percentage of carbon content and impact force on groove rollers are the three inputs and it produces two outputs in the form of either Andon (a visual signal) or line stoppage. By using Multiple Input and Multiple Output (MIMO) autonomation system, surface defects can be prevented by monitoring level of inputs.},

  abstract={Dramatic developments in localization techniques have been achieved recently to overcome the difficulties of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. The diversity of IoT in nearly all sectors, which requires the connection among objects, makes localization an important aspect in the field as it adds to the features of IoT. Precisely estimating the position of an object is one of the main purposes of localization to facilitate the exchange of information among the objects. The aim of this work is to explore the existing localization techniques and to evaluate existing encapsulating classification systems. For the literature survey, we have searched in all major databases. Relevant papers (amongst more than hundreds of the papers) are considered and evaluated to contribute to this work. In conclusion, the presented survey will assist people who are working in the field of localization in IoT and different related methods.},

  year={2005},

  pages={464-473 Vol. 1},
  abstract={Recent technological advances have made it possible to support long lifetime and large volume streaming data transmissions in sensor networks. A major challenge is to maximize the lifetime of battery-powered sensors to support such transmissions. Battery, as the power provider of the sensors, therefore emerges as the key factor for achieving high performance in such applications. Recent study in battery technology reveals that the behavior of battery discharging is more complex than we used to think. Battery powered sensors might waste a huge amount of energy if we do not carefully schedule and budget their discharging. In this paper we study the effect of battery behavior on routing for streaming data transmissions in wireless sensor networks. We first give an on-line computable energy model to mathematically model battery discharge behavior. We show that the model can capture and describe battery behavior accurately at low computational complexity and thus is suitable for on-line battery capacity computation. Based on this battery model we then present a battery-aware routing (BAR) protocol to schedule the routing in wireless sensor networks. The routing protocol is sensitive to the battery status of routing nodes and avoids energy loss. We use the battery data from actual sensors to evaluate the performance of our protocol. The results show that the battery-aware protocol proposed in this paper performs well and can save a significant amount of energy compared to existing routing protocols for streaming data transmissions. The network lifetime is also prolonged with maximum data throughput. As far as we know; this is the first work considering battery-awareness with an accurate analytical on-line computable battery model in sensor network routing. We believe our battery model can be used to explore other energy efficient schemes for wireless networks as well.},

  title={The Unknown Spatial Quality of Dense Point Clouds Derived From Stereo Images}, 
  year={2015},
  volume={12},

  pages={1013-1017},
  abstract={Is it possible to use stereo images to generate point clouds and to compute rigorous uncertainty maps? Currently, neither modern commercial photogrammetric software nor state-of-the-art algorithms are able to provide a spatial distribution of uncertainty. In this letter, we explain why this is the case, despite a high demand from the user community. Many applications would indeed benefit from the availability of error bars on each point, as uncertainties on derived models and quantities could be accurately predicted. For instance, change detection could be performed rigorously since the statistical significance of observed changes could be computed. In this letter, we focus on dense stereo methods. We first explain that it is not possible to derive reliable predictive uncertainties mainly due to matching and modeling errors. Our research shows that both intrinsic and practical limitations of the algorithms lead to unpredictable artifacts. Then, we focus on the use of empirical errors, showing that, despite the redundancy brought by multiview stereo, there is a fundamental limitation due to the unknown density of independent measurements. We think that these problems will represent a big challenge for the future, as these limitations cannot be addressed by algorithmic design, computational power, or imaging sensor technology.},

  title={Computer Vision on the Edge: Individual Cattle Identification in Real-time with ReadMyCow System}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={7041-7050},
  abstract={In precision livestock farming, the individual identification of cattle is crucial to inform the decisions made to enhance animal welfare, health, and productivity. In literature, models exist that can read ear tags; however, they are not easily portable to real-world cattle production environments and make predictions mainly on still images. We propose a video-based cattle ear tag reading system, called ReadMyCow, which takes advantage of the temporal characteristics in videos to accurately detect, track, and read cattle ear tags at 25 FPS on edge devices. For each frame in a video, ReadMyCow functions in two steps. 1) Tag detection: a YOLOv5s Object Detection model and NVIDIA Deepstream Tracking Layer detect and track the tags present. 2) Tag reading: the novel WhenToRead module decides whether to read each tag, using a TRBA Scene Text Recognition model, or to use the reading from a previous frame. The system is implemented on an edge device, namely the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin or Xavier, making it portable to cattle production environments without external computational resources. To attain real-time speeds, ReadMyCow only reads the detected tag in the current frame if it thinks it will get a better reading when a decision metric is significantly improved in the current frame. Ideally, this means the best reading of a tag is found and stored throughout a tag’s presence in the video, even when the tag becomes occluded or blurry. While testing the system at a real Midwestern dairy farm housing 9,000 cows, 96.1% of printed ear tags were accurately read by the ReadMyCow system, demonstrating its real-world commercial potential. ReadMyCow opens opportunities for informed data-driven decision-making processes on commercial cattle farms.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Recently, the interest in robots capable of experiencing empathy and displaying emotions has grown. This trend can be attributed to the pervasive presence of robots in many environments, such as homes, offices, museums, and hospitals, that require more empathic and reliable human-machine relationships. Recent studies demonstrated that providing the robot with the ability to think aloud improves humans’ trust in machines, as they can understand the underlying reasoning of the artifact, what conclusions it can draw, and why and how. This work integrates a robot’s inner speech mechanism with Damasio’s theory of emotions to make the robot functionally conscious of its emotional experience, leading to a computational model of Extended Consciousness, SUSAN (Self-dialogue Utility in Simulating Artificial Emotions). Damasio claims that emotions originate within the body and precede and influence the reasoning processes that make the person aware of them. According to his theory, Extended Consciousness refers to the humans’ cognitive processes that make the humans themselves aware of the physiological experiences of emotions purged by an external stimulus. SUSAN models the bodily emotional experience and simulates the awareness of the emergent emotion by using inner speech. The model is presented, and the initial results related to a use case are discussed.},

  pages={1175-1191},
  abstract={The ability to recognize emotion is one of the hallmarks of emotional intelligence, an aspect of human intelligence that has been argued to be even more important than mathematical and verbal intelligences. This paper proposes that machine intelligence needs to include emotional intelligence and demonstrates results toward this goal: developing a machine's ability to recognize the human affective state given four physiological signals. We describe difficult issues unique to obtaining reliable affective data and collect a large set of data from a subject trying to elicit and experience each of eight emotional states, daily, over multiple weeks. This paper presents and compares multiple algorithms for feature-based recognition of emotional state from this data. We analyze four physiological signals that exhibit problematic day-to-day variations: The features of different emotions on the same day tend to cluster more tightly than do the features of the same emotion on different days. To handle the daily variations, we propose new features and algorithms and compare their performance. We find that the technique of seeding a Fisher Projection with the results of sequential floating forward search improves the performance of the Fisher Projection and provides the highest recognition rates reported to date for classification of affect from physiology: 81 percent recognition accuracy on eight classes of emotion, including neutral.},

  title={A Cognitive Model of Improvisation in Emergency Management}, 
  year={2007},
  volume={37},
  number={4},
  pages={547-561},
  abstract={An enduring characteristic of emergencies is the need for near-simultaneous development and deployment of new management procedures. This need can arise with the onset of highly novel problems and the need to act quickly-factors that reduce opportunities for extensive planning in managing the emergency. As a result, decision makers in emergencies must be prepared to improvise. By understanding the cognitive processes in improvisation, organizations can better learn how to plan for, manage, and learn from improvised action. To help create this understanding, this paper reviews and synthesizes prior results on improvisation in the art of jazz, exploring how these results may be applied to improvisation in emergency management. A theory of improvisation in emergency management is then developed and expressed as a cognitive model. The modelpsilas implementation in computer-executable code is then reviewed, along with an illustration of how the model improvises in an emergency situation. Finally, implications of this model and opportunities for future research are presented.},

SC is causing a paradigm shift in engineering and science fields since it can solve problems that have not been able to be solved by traditional analytic methods. In addition, SC yields rich knowledge representation, flexible knowledge acquisition, and flexible knowledge processing, which enable intelligent systems to be constructed at low cost. This paper reviews applications of SC in several industrial fields to show the various innovations by TR, HMIQ, and low cost in industries that have been made possible by the use of SC. Our paper intends to remove the gap between theory and practice and attempts to learn how to apply soft computing practically to industrial systems from examples/analogy, reviewing many application papers.},

  pages={393-407},
  abstract={The notion of the necessary criticality (both with respect to path and to activity) of a network with imprecisely defined (by means of intervals or fuzzy intervals) activity duration times is introduced and analyzed. It is shown, in the interval case, that both the problem of asserting whether a given path is necessarily critical and the problem of determining an arbitrary necessarily critical path (more exactly, a subnetwork covering all the necessarily critical paths) are easy. The corresponding solution algorithms are proposed. However, the problem of evaluating whether a given activity is necessarily critical does not seem to be so easy. Certain conditions are formulated which, in some situations (but not in all possible situations), allow the necessary criticality of activities to be evaluated. The results obtained for networks with interval activity duration times are generalized to the case of networks with fuzzy activity duration times. Two effective algorithms for calculating the degree of necessary criticality of a fixed path, as well as an algorithm for determining the paths that are necessarily critical to the maximum degree, are proposed.},

The goal of this competition was to set a common platform for evaluation of the recent development in sclera segmentation and also to attract the attention of researchers to this new area. In this regard, we have prepared a Multi-Angle Sclera Dataset (MASD) version 1. It is comprised of 2624 RGB images taken from both the eyes of 82 identities. In other words, it consists of images of 164 (82*2) different eyes. Moreover, we have prepared manual segmentation masks of these images to create the baseline. We have, furthermore, adopted precision and recall-based statistical measures to evaluate the effectiveness and the ranks of the competing algorithms. To summarize, ten participants registered for the competition, and among them four participants submitted their algorithms/ systems. The results achieved by these algorithms reflect noteworthy developments in the literature of sclera segmentation employing cutting edge segmentation techniques. Along with the algorithm of the four competing teams and their results, the MASD version 1 dataset will also be freely available for research purposes from the organizer's website.},

  abstract={Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (Chat-GPT) and related Generative AI models are leading a paradigm shift in the acceptance and application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across all disciplines and industry sectors. Despite the criticisms of an ‘intelligence without knowledge or reasoning or the notions of truth’, ChatGPT is highly effective at human-like conversation with seemingly sophisticated and useful responses to questions, summarization, classification, extraction and generation tasks. Unlike similar large AI models in the modalities of image, audio and video, text-based conversation is straightforward and familiar to a large audience of regular users of the Internet and smartphone applications. This is further accentuated by the large-scale adoption of ‘standard’ chatbot technologies for trivial conversations in task-specific automation, across every industry sector. This rare combination of highly effective human-like conversation, familiarity of foundational technology and versatility of intelligent application, has led to several challenges and opportunities in leveraging generative AI. A primary challenge is its impact on the academic integrity of scholarly work, where AI-generated content can be useful and detrimental in both teaching and research. On the other hand, ChatGPT presents a unique opportunity in augmenting preexisting (‘standard’) chatbots with human-like conversation for advanced intelligent automation, across all application domains. Although diametrically opposed, the challenge of addressing academic integrity and the opportunity of augmenting pre-existing chatbots are grounded in the conversational AI capabilities of ChatGPT and similar generative AI models. In this paper, we investigate these formative capabilities and present guidelines for leveraging ChatGPT and similar generative AI models.},

  abstract={The recent progress in generative AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), has brought about a transformation in the field of education. Conversational LLM services, such as Google's Bard and OpenAI's ChatGPT, offer students access to many abilities such as summarization and generation of text and code, and on-demand replies to questions on expert topics. In this paper, we observe ChatGPT to explore how LLM services impact learning and instruction in higher education. First, we mapped the capabilities of the system by reviewing the grey literature on ChatGPT and using the system ourselves for two months. Second, we selected a Bachelor level computer science curriculum from a Finnish university, and examined the impact of ChatGPT on the offered courses. As an outcome of this study, we highlight 13 implications for students' learning in higher education, and discuss the contemporary future of AI-assisted learning in universities and beyond.},

  abstract={This research is about how to create an educational video game whose main purpose is to stimulate logical and spatial reasoning of children. For this goal, we have applied an incremental methodology in order to be able to produce a Massive Multiplayer Online Game. With the intention of incorporating operations necessary for cognitive development and simultaneously to control the mechanics of the video game, we applied Artificial Intelligence, Intelligent Agents, and modern 3D technology approaches such as Unity 3D Game Engine and Photon Cloud. Validation of our solution has been performed by running several tests in public schools. The results demonstrate that this educational software stimulates the cognitive development of children.},

  title={Evaluation of the parallelization potential for efficient multimedia implementations: dynamic evaluation of algorithm critical path}, 
  year={2005},
  volume={15},
  number={5},
  pages={593-608},
  abstract={This paper presents a model metrics and a methodology for evaluating the critical path on the data flow execution graph (DFEG) of multimedia algorithms specified as C programs. The paper describes an efficient dynamic critical path evaluation approach that generates no explicit execution graph. Such approach includes two key stages: 1) the instrumentation of the C code and the mapping into a C++ code version and 2) the execution of the C++ code under real input data and finally the actual dynamic evaluation of the critical path. The model metrics and the software analysis methodologies aim at the estimation and at the increase of the upper bound of execution speed and parallelization potential. Both metrics and methodology are particularly tailored for application with complex multimedia algorithms. Critical path analysis and the subsequent algorithmic development stage is a fundamental methodological preliminary step for the efficient definition of architectures when the objective is the implementation of the multimedia algorithm on systems-on-chips or heterogeneous platforms.},

  abstract={In this paper, we report our first experiment in teaching the theory of computability in the problem-based way. As far as we know, this is the first experiment of applying the problem-based method to a purely theoretical course of computer science. Performing the course consisted of three parts: First, the new subjects were learnt according to the classical seven step method, which contains both individual and group work, and problem reports were written. Second, the students participated in a traditional exercise session, in which the new techniques were practised in details. And third, the students kept a learning diary, in which they processed the subjects further, tried to construct an overall schema of things learnt, and supervised their own learning. The results were really successful: the students committed themselves well and the drop out percentage was very small; they achieved very deep understanding of the subjects measured by their grades and quality of learning diaries; the experience was enjoyable for both the students and the teachers; and finally, the method supported different kinds of learners very well.},

  title={Efficient smart monte carlo based SSTA on graphics processing units with improved resource utilization}, 
  year={2010},
  volume={},

  pages={793-798},
  abstract={To exploit the benefits of throughput-optimized processors such as GPUs, applications need to be redesigned to achieve performance and efficiency. In this work, we present techniques to speed up statistical timing analysis on throughput processors. We draw upon advancements in improving the efficiency of Monte Carlo based statistical static timing analysis (MC SSTA) using techniques to reduce the sample size or smart sampling techniques. An efficient smart sampling technique, Stratification + Hybrid Quasi Monte Carlo (SH-QMC), is implemented on a GPU based on NVIDIA CUDA architecture. We show that although this application is based on MC analysis with straightforward parallelism available, achieving performance and efficiency on the GPU requires exposing more parallelism and finding locality in computations. This is in contrast with random sampling based algorithms which are inefficient in terms of sample size but can keep resources utilized on a GPU. We show that SH-QMC implemented on a Multi GPU is twice as fast as a single STA on a CPU for benchmark circuits considered. In terms of an efficiency metric, which measures the ability to convert a reduction in sample size to a corresponding reduction in runtime w.r.t a random sampling approach, we achieve 73.9% efficiency with the proposed approaches compared to 4.3% for an implementation involving performing computations on smart samples in parallel. Another contribution of the paper is a critical graph analysis technique to improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo based SSTA, leading to 2-9X further speedup.},
