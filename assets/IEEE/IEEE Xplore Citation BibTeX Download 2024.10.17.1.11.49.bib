  abstract={Credit card fraud, although not directly impacting banks, does have repercussions for the financial sector as a whole. Criminals pose a significant threat to safety since they are continually thinking up new methods to commit these types of fraud. Early detection of fraudulent behavior is therefore vital to retain customer trust and defend the firm. Since lawful transactions far outnumber fraudulent transactions, which typically make up less than 1% of all transactions, addressing the class imbalance issue in the data presents a significant challenge for developing fraud detection algorithms. It is challenging to identify a positive example (fraudulent case), and this challenge increases as more data is gathered, leading to a lower proportion of positive examples. Because of this, research is very important. Models for making predictions were trained in this study utilizing a variety of sampling strategies, including the ANN, GBM, and the RF. Models used SMOTE, RUS, DBSMOTE, and SMOTE plus ENS were all examples of Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTEENN). This research suggests that SMOTE-based sampling techniques will provide positive results. The highest recall (0.81) was achieved by the SMOTE sampling method when a DRF classifier was used. It was determined that this classifier has an accuracy score of 0.87. The Stacked Ensembling algorithm was accomplished using altogether of collected data, and its average performance was 0.78, making it the clear winner. As a fraud detection model, the Stacked Ensemble has performed well in most sampling operations.},

  title={Graph model for conflict resolution for mixed-stability combinatorial foresight based on the combination of regret theory and VIKOR method}, 
  year={2024},

  pages={1-14},
  abstract={The graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR) is a branch of decision-making; therefore, how to scientifically abstract the evaluative thinking of decision-makers (DMs) has always been a core research point in decision science. In this context, further consideration of the heterogeneous behavior of competitors and their impact on the evolution of conflicts deserves special attention. Usually, DMs' evaluation thinking has certain ambiguity and uncertainty, and they are accustomed to giving qualitative evaluation information. Given the unique advantages of trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy sets (TrIT2FS) in the fusion of decision domains and transformational linguistic expressions, this paper constructs a theoretical framework for a graph model on TrIT2FS and proposes a method for calculating DMs preference ranking and a heterogeneous combinatorial foresight stability function. Firstly, the DMs will consider multiple factors in the decision evaluation process, and there are specific regret avoidance psychological behavior characteristics; thus, this paper integrates VIKOR and regret theory to solve the DM's preference ranking and expands on a new preference ranking method. Secondly, mixed stability definitions based on TrIT2FS are proposed to facilitate the description of different sanctioning behaviors of heterogeneous opponents. Subsequently, a heterogeneous combinatorial foresight stability function is proposed to quickly obtain conflict evolution solutions in complex dynamic conflict problems based on the extended mixed stability definitions. Finally, to thoroughly test the correctness and practicality of the proposed theory, the conflict between inputs and outputs of the technological transformation of enterprises under the low-carbon strategy is used as a specific application scenario and example for validation.},

  year={2024},
  volume={9},
  number={1},
  pages={659-666},
  abstract={Dexterous robotic grasping gains great benefits from tactile sensation, but delicate object exploration by tactile information is challenged by difficulty in rich and efficient data production. In this letter, we propose a tactile-based in-hand object perception approach, empowered by a sim-to-real approach toward a data-efficient learning process. A high-fidelity tactile input, measured by a pair of vision-based tactile sensors, was represented as a point cloud facilitating dual functionality of object classification and the associated pose estimation. For the classification, we constructed PoinTacNet, a variation of PointNet to fit into tactile data processing. A reliable simulation methodology on tactile input was employed for the pretraining of the model, transferred to the fine-tuning process facing real tactile data. Taking inspiration from human behaviors, a re-grasping strategy was imparted by means of conditional accumulation of class likelihood distribution. The result of the framework facilitates a high object classification accuracy of 83.89$\%$ on the ten objects from McMaster-Carr's CAD models, which is significantly improved by the re-grasping. In addition, a set of benchmarks displays the computational efficiency in the sim-to-real transfer. In line with the successful classification, the posture of in-hand objects is estimated using point cloud registration algorithms, achieving an average angular and translational RMSE of 5.03$^\circ$ and 2.41 mm, respectively. The proposed approach has the potential to enable robots to attain human-like haptic exploration skills for perceiving unstructured environments.},

  pages={109-119},
  abstract={Dealing with uncertainty is always a challenging problem, and different tools have been proposed to deal with it. Recently, a new model that is based on hesitant fuzzy sets has been presented to manage situations in which experts hesitate between several values to assess an indicator, alternative, variable, etc. Hesitant fuzzy sets suit the modeling of quantitative settings; however, similar situations may occur in qualitative settings so that experts think of several possible linguistic values or richer expressions than a single term for an indicator, alternative, variable, etc. In this paper, the concept of a hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set is introduced to provide a linguistic and computational basis to increase the richness of linguistic elicitation based on the fuzzy linguistic approach and the use of context-free grammars by using comparative terms. Then, a multicriteria linguistic decision-making model is presented in which experts provide their assessments by eliciting linguistic expressions. This decision model manages such linguistic expressions by means of its representation using hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) is successfully intervening in areas such as education, health and industry. In education, AI is being used to improve educational processes. UNESCO considers as a new vision to involve AI not only as a didactic medium, but also as a science in which children can develop their intellect, through workshops, courses and curricula focused on the fundamentals of AI, allowing them to develop skills such as computational thinking and critical thinking. The present Systematic Literature Review was developed according to the methodological guidelines proposed by Barbara Kitchenham, with the objective of identifying how AI teaching-learning processes are carried out from early ages. Sixty-four studies were obtained between 2016-2021, where eleven countries are identified with AI teaching initiatives, through workshops, courses and projects to update their curricula; machine learning and educational robotics are the two branches linked to AI that are currently taught to children and adolescents.},

  abstract={Enlightened requirements engineering (RE) researchers and practitioners generally accept that RE is as much about understanding the world as it is about understanding the software and systems that will be built to inhabit that world. As a result, the RE field has fostered a multi-disciplinary following of researchers and practitioners who are prepared to engage deeply in application domains, to apply a range of technical and socio-technical skills to understand those domains, and to accept that the outcome of an effective RE process may not deliver a software system at all. The RE community has also developed, deployed, and evaluated a wide range of contributions that reflect such enlightenment: conceptual models that reflect the relationships between the world and the machine, domain models and scenarios that reflect understandings of problem domains, and enterprise models that reflect the organisations and processes that build and deploy systems. All these in addition to the models that capture the all-important behaviour of systems and software. It seems to me however that the RE discipline is at a crossroads. The mechanics of the discipline appear to be established - much of the published research is now empirical - or technical, but only in so far as it responds to technological advances elsewhere, such as mobile and ubiquitous technologies represented by the Internet of Things, richer application domains such as Industrie 4.0 and Smart Cities, or more advanced computational techniques that are maturing, such AI, machine learning, and blockchains. As a community, we reassure ourselves that our discipline is safe and thriving, after all RE is a “forever problem”: all systems we wish to build will have requirements, now and forever. But this is to be complacent. RE has no protected status to study and deploy requirements. The formal models we elicit, design, and build are increasingly deployable by other disciplines, as are the values that we seek our modern, AI-driven systems to embody. A new and potentially radical re-framing of our discipline may be needed, and I will speculate what this may look like. It may require letting go of what we have considered to be the boundaries of our discipline, while embracing new but fluid boundaries. I have advocated and explored “software without boundaries” as one such framing that challenges the separation of `world and the machine', not because I don't accept the separation of the `what' and the `how', the `indicative' and the `optative', or the `problem' and the `solution', but because the world we live in no longer accepts these separations. Society, more often than not, does not think of systems, of technology, or indeed of software; it thinks of ways of working, ways of interacting, ways of living. Requirements, such as they are, are `requirements we live by' not requirements of systems in the world. At an extreme, if one believes the AI hype, `the world and the machine' will increasingly be replaced by the `world in the machine'. Where does the RE community stand on this, and what can this community do to contribute to the framing and solving of this new reality? My own work in recent years has evolved to reflect the above. I still revisit, with some pride, the `RE Roadmap' that Steve Easterbrook and I published in 2000 - many of the fundamental RE principles we presented still hold today. But I cringe at how we missed the changing nature of the world in which we operate: a world populated by autonomous and adaptive systems, populated by big data and associated analytics, and populated by stakeholders whose multiple perspectives reflect a multitude of ethical and social values, not all of which are wholesome, and many of which are actively subversive or malicious. My own research on security and privacy requirements only scratches the surface of this evolving reality. I invite the RE community to reflect on how it frames its own research in this context.},

  year={2023},
  volume={32},
  number={},
  pages={6274-6288},
  abstract={Scene graph generation (SGG) and human-object interaction (HOI) detection are two important visual tasks aiming at localising and recognising relationships between objects, and interactions between humans and objects, respectively. Prevailing works treat these tasks as distinct tasks, leading to the development of task-specific models tailored to individual datasets. However, we posit that the presence of visual relationships can furnish crucial contextual and intricate relational cues that significantly augment the inference of human-object interactions. This motivates us to think if there is a natural intrinsic relationship between the two tasks, where scene graphs can serve as a source for inferring human-object interactions. In light of this, we introduce SG2HOI+, a unified one-step model based on the Transformer architecture. Our approach employs two interactive hierarchical Transformers to seamlessly unify the tasks of SGG and HOI detection. Concretely, we initiate a relation Transformer tasked with generating relation triples from a suite of visual features. Subsequently, we employ another transformer-based decoder to predict human-object interactions based on the generated relation triples. A comprehensive series of experiments conducted across established benchmark datasets including Visual Genome, V-COCO, and HICO-DET demonstrates the compelling performance of our SG2HOI+ model in comparison to prevalent one-stage SGG models. Remarkably, our approach achieves competitive performance when compared to state-of-the-art HOI methods. Additionally, we observe that our SG2HOI+ jointly trained on both SGG and HOI tasks in an end-to-end manner yields substantial improvements for both tasks compared to individualized training paradigms.},

  abstract={There is a growing literature demonstrating the importance of collaboration and teamwork in the process of learning computational thinking and the foundational aspects of computer science. While Collaborative Virtual Environments are becoming widespread in the software development professional domain and in various areas of advanced learning, their use in the introductory stages of learning computing is still very limited. On the other hand, in recent years, there has been a blooming of attractive programming environments specifically designed to expose young students (e.g., middle school age) to computational thinking. Alice is a very popular introductory programming environment, focused on programming through animations and story-telling. This paper introduces a novel extension of the Alice framework that enables interaction and collaboration among students in the development of programs. In particular, the new version of Alice described in this paper provides support for virtual pair programming. The modified version of Alice allows two students to remotely share a virtual world, and interact in its construction; the system supports roles assignments, to allow teachers to control activities and contributions of the two students in the creation of a programming project.},

Based on the social trends, various web services for the education of programming which improves the computational thinking of a student. Among the web services, block-based programming languages are well known as an effective educational tool for a primary student though a freshman in the university. These tools are proven to be useful tools since the tools provide same programming environment to the students and the teachers anytime and anywhere. However, the environments may be insufficient for learning practical programming languages, such as C/C++ and Java, because they are not the block-based programming languages.

  abstract={In a world in a continuous and rapid change, it is absolutely necessary for our students to keep up with the rapid progress of new technologies: Internet of Things (IoT), Robotics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) etc. The rapid evolution and diversification of these emerging technologies has recently led to their introduction into the educational offer of the school curriculum for the gymnasium. The discipline of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has already been implemented, a discipline that involves both the formation of skills to use new technologies and the formation of computational thinking necessary for the efficient and intelligent use of these technologies. In order to teach and learn Physics from a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) educational perspective, we initiated optional school courses of IoT, Robotics and AI (approached through Machine Learning). These courses stimulate, at the level of students, computational thinking, creativity and innovation and lead, from an interdisciplinary perspective, to the development of emerging specializations such as Mathematics-Physics-Automation, Mathematics-Physics-Electronics, Mathematics-Physics-Informatics-Robotics etc. In this paper we presented a method of approaching, in the school educational space, the study of wireless communication technologies between smart devices, through an Educational Robotics project. The project consisted of creating a wireless controlled mobile robotic platform (robot car) via a Bluetooth module connected to an Arduino Uno board.},

The participants' participation behaviors and verbal utterances during the intervention sessions have been archived via screen and webcam recordings.

  abstract={This research explores the psychology of programming and the pedagogical environment in a certificate granting urban immigrant engineer retraining program in New York City. The program is aimed at teaching under-represented immigrant engineer students to learn how to program in the Java programming language. The programming concepts and the fostered pedagogical environment were implemented in three-hour evening sessions over 15 weeks in which the students were encouraged to develop programming communities while working on computational thinking concept strands. The research findings that we report are threefold. First, we report on how we fostered building programming concepts into the curriculum into a set of activities specifically designed for an immigrant engineer retraining program with students ranging in backgrounds. We found that at that the program curriculum must be flexible enough for student learning regardless of the fact that a student may miss sessions. Second, we report on how an effective pedagogical environment, which fosters student-centered learning, was promoted so that the students could construct their own meanings of the programming concepts. Third, we report on implementation strategies unique to a retraining program, such as specific environmental constraints as well as how sessions were partitioned into components that fostered computational thinking while learning Java. Our findings provide unique insights into intervention constraints for an urban retraining program which can be used to guide and inform further retraining computer learning program research.},

  abstract={Schools are increasingly integrating character education to facilitate improved moral thinking and pro social behavior among students. An effective method for delivering character education is problem solving moral and social situations represented visually as animated vignettes. However, schools are rarely able to use animated vignettes since existing tools do not allow them to be easily created and having them created externally is overly expensive. In this paper, we describe the design, use, and evaluation of a computational tool that enables students to construct their own animated vignettes. By building, sharing, and responding to vignettes, students become engaged in problem solving moral and social situations. Evaluations showed that users are able to build meaningful vignettes, our tool is easy to learn and fun to use, and our tool’s multimedia features are often used and well-liked.

  abstract={Enculturation to engineering is a topic of interest to professional organizations such as ASEE or IEEE. Enculturation can be understood as the process by which students are assimilated into the engineering culture. This culture involves the base knowledge, practices, and values shared by the community of practicing engineers. Both the culture and its assimilation are somewhat obscure and often attributed to role-modeling and hidden curriculum. Nevertheless, undergraduate students are expected to undergo this assimilation process, and by the end of a five-year program, they behave, talk, and do what engineers do. An approach to this process is the well-established model of engineering identity. This model of identity, however, limits its scope to the intrinsic process occurring in the student without paying much attention to the support systems expected to welcome and nurture students into the profession. Enculturation is a relatively new model that proposes both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting this assimilation of students. During the Spring of 2022, a team of researchers at a U.S. Southwest institution applied a survey to operationalize the extrinsic factors of a recently outlined engineering model of enculturation to understand the impact of COVID on engineering students. Eight Likert-based questions were asked to 534 engineering undergraduate students at different school year classifications (e.g., sophomore, junior, or senior). The model of enculturation tested eight extrinsic factors involving (1) engineering design, (2) teamwork, (3) engineering profession, (4) ethics, (5) engineering communications, (6) mathematical/physical modeling, (7) problem-solving, and (8) algorithmic/computational thinking. Additional Likert-based questions asked students about the perceived impact of COVID on their educational experience. The research questions guiding their investigation were: (a) How are the dimensions of enculturation to engineering changing across engineering undergraduate classifications?, and (b) How is enculturation associated with the COVID impact on students? Preliminary results show that six of the factors (namely 1–5 and 7) increase by students' school classification. This means that students in the lower years of their undergraduate program perceive their enculturation, as portrayed by factors 1–5 & 7, less than students at more advanced stages of their program. In terms of the perceived impact of COVID, only two factors showed negative correlations with this perceived impact The factors were ethics and algorithmic/computational thinking. In other words, the worse the student's perception of COVID's impact on their educational experience, the less they endorsed their enculturation in the impact of society of their technical solutions and their use of programming languages. While these results show encouraging applicability of the enculturation model, it can only be considered a first approach to a more fully developed model. The researchers expect to engage the FIE community in a discussion leading to a more refined enculturation model.},

  abstract={Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Learning representations is critical for machine learning and very computation-intensive process. There are many opportunities to introduce efficiencies through parallel and distributed computing. The success of machine learning algorithms depends on data representation. Different representations can expose or hide different features of the data. As we think about the future of learning representations and its impact on machine learning it is important to consider the state of the art of machine learning today, the challenges and opportunities for addressing the computation issues around representation learning, and how to get to deeper understanding and more capabilities in machine learned models. In this talk I will describe 4 ideas related to computational issues in representation learning: reducing uncertainty, developing compact representations, debasing the training data, and developing privacy-preserving representations.},

  abstract={6G is currently under definition, often being addressed from a plain telecommunications perspective as an evolutionary paradigm that represents an extension of 5G. Having as its horizon 2030, 6G initiatives are being deployed across the globe, to further ignite the development of 6G services. In its philosophy core, 6G embodies the &#x201C;human in the loop&#x201D; principle. The research effort aimed at 6G requires an interdisciplinary approach that ignites discussion across different key technological sectors, ranging from communications to services and business cases. The contribution of this book to research in the field concerns an evolutionary and interdisciplinary design of 6G as a paradigm that can be addressed by working together the four different computational areas of CONASENSE: communications; satellites and navigation; sensing; services. This book starts with a perspective on 6G challenges towards sustainability and addressing new business models, moving on to key topics concerning communications. It ends with chapters focusing on 6G service design. This book is, therefore, envisioned to assist in developing critical thinking to back up novel networking, applications, and services towards 6G.},

  title={Engineering Student Perspectives of a New Required Programming Course}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},

  abstract={In this research to practice report, we present student perceptions of a new first-year engineering programming class that was designed by informed research practices. While the College of Engineering at the participating university saw a lot of major switching in the first year, there were not many students switching into computer science (CS). This could have been because other engineering major classes did not transfer well to CS or that students would be a year behind in the programming classes. In either case, the participating university felt that computational thinking and programming were an important part of first-year engineering exploration and believed that all 21st century engineering majors should learn to program in a general purpose language, such as Python or C++. Past research found that prior programming experience, knowledge organization, self-efficacy, and class size were factors impacting student performance in early programming courses, and learning about programming enhanced students' problem-solving skills and improved perceptions about CS. Many other research studies showed that the context in which programming material was presented to non-majors was important for their learning and interest, and themed, mixed-context courses with real-world engineering problems worked well. Therefore, in the spring 2022, we created 12, 100-person sections of a course titled “Engineering Computational and Algorithmic Thinking” for a new first-year engineering experience. Each section was taught by a different instructor representing a variety of disciplines and topics in the College of Engineering. This paper describes the research to practice and engineering student perceptions of the new, required programming class. We hypothesized that engineering students would say that the course should be required for all engineering majors, but we wanted to know why. We believed that student prior programming experience, engineering major, and other demographics would play a role in their responses. We thematically analyzed student justifications to identify emerging themes, and we used a mixed-method approach to correlate themes to different student demographics, engineering major interest, and prior programming experience. The majority of engineering students agreed that the first-year engineering course should be required, and prior programming experience and major played the largest role.},

  pages={123801-123808},
  abstract={At present, conveyor belt tearing is the most serious fault of belt conveyor, causing the greatest loss. This paper aims to overcome the issues of poor accuracy, low precision, and poor real-time performance in the longitudinal tear detection of the conveyor belt of the belt conveyor. Specifically, this paper presents a method of longitudinal tear detection of conveyor belt based on the sound signal. According to the recognition of the tearing sound signal, the longitudinal tearing of conveyor belt can be detected. A dynamic MFCC feature extraction method is proposed to extract the sound signal feature. An improved DenseNet neural network model is designed, which is used to classify the longitudinal sound of the belt conveyor to realize the longitudinal tearing detection of the conveyor belt.The experimental results demonstrate that the method in this paper achieves the sound detection of the longitudinal tear of the conveyor belt, and the average accuracy of the longitudinal tear detection of the conveyor belt of the belt conveyor reaches 95.42%, which satisfies the requirements of the longitudinal tear detection of the conveyor belt of the belt conveyor.Applying this method to the longitudinal tearing detection of conveyor belt can solve the shortcomings of existing methods and realize the detection of the longitudinal tearing fault of conveyor belt.},

  title={MS-IHHO-LSTM: Carbon Price Prediction Model of Multi-Source Data Based on Improved Swarm Intelligence Algorithm and Deep Learning Method}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={12},
  number={},
  pages={80754-80769},
  abstract={Accurate carbon price prediction can help save energy and reduce emissions worldwide. Thus, this paper proposes a model that combines swarm intelligence algorithms with deep learning to predict carbon prices. In this model, we collect news related to carbon trading, construct a dictionary of carbon financial sentiment, and determine the emotional value of the carbon news. Secondly, The Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm is improved by updating the escape energy and introducing the inertia weight. Then, the LSTM is optimized using the improved Harris Hawks Optimization (IHHO) algorithm. Finally, technical and emotional data on carbon price as multiple source input values are integrated, and the MS-IHHO-LSTM prediction model is established. The results show that the MAPE of IHHO-LSTM is 1.89%, 30.48%, and 10.30% better than that of HHO-LSTM in Hubei, Shanghai, and Shenzhen Carbon Exchanges, respectively. Similarly, MS-IHHO-LSTM showed a lower MAPE than IHHO-LSTM by 27.79%, 29.82%, and 6.33% in the corresponding regions. The results of the experiment indicate that: 1) Using IHHO to optimize LSTM hyperparameters can avoid falling into local optimal and improve prediction accuracy; 2) Incorporating emotional values can further enhance the model’s performance. The MS-IHHO-LSTM prediction model facilitates low-carbon investment, technological innovation, and green production, enabling enterprises to support environmental sustainability.},
