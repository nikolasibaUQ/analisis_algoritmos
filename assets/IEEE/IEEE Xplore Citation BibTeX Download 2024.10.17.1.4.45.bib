  abstract={As the students’ profile and the industry’s expectations change over time, universities must adopt learning methodologies to deliver more suitable graduates to the labor market. The Universidad Privada Boliviana (UPB) has been developing experiential learning practices by implementing challenge-based learning (CBL) to enrich undergraduates’ curricula. One example reflected in the CBL experiences developed by Taquiña Brewery, one of the five breweries of the Cervecería Boliviana Nacional (CBN), and the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department of the UPB between 2018 and 2019. As a result, the students widely accepted the methodology, and academics from all disciplines were trained to replicate CBL experiences in their classrooms. While CBN found the opportunity to hire new talent, receive a fresh perspective on recurrent operational issues, and find new ideas based on theoretical concepts. This work contributes to the exemplification of innovative approaches to enhance the teaching and learning of Supply Chain Management and Logistics.},

  abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a kind of Dementia. It affects the brain functions, thinking ability and creates memory loss. Each stage of AD is worsening the symptoms and also affects the patient's daily activities. The current diagnosis AD detection process is not providing an accurate report for the early stages of AD. Therefore, accurate Alzheimer detection is an open challenge for the researchers. In this research, a deep learning model is introduced to improve Alzheimer's stage diagnosis. The Hybrid deep model is designed to detect abnormal changes in brain (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) MRI scans. It utilizes the multi-class log loss (MCLL) function as the objective function to reduce the error rate in detecting AD stages. The MCLL approach computes the variations in actual and detected AD stages of each biomarkers features of input MRI images to identify loss rate. It helps to reduce the loss rate in AD stages detection. Moreover, the Hybrid deep learning model for Alzheimer stages detection (HDLMASD)system analysis the images deeply to provide accurate biomarkers detection with the help of all essential biomarkers processing steps. The efficiency of the Alzheimer stages diagnosis system is evaluated with various evaluation metrics. Finally, a comparative analysis is made with multiple present diagnosis systems to verify the performance of the AD detection system. The performance analysis proves that the AD stages diagnosis approach accuracy rate is improved up to 0.47% and the prediction error rate reduced up to 0.49% than comparison approaches.},

  abstract={Human behaviour representation (HBR) is playing a significant role in Computer-Generated Forces (CGFs). However, current HBR lacks realistic and human-like characteristics, and many domain experts think that integrating personality and individual differences into existing simulation tools in CGFs is able to improve HBR. This article describes an approach to represent reasoning with personality effects in variable cognitive processes in CGFs. By combining the Integrated Performance Modelling Environment (IPME), the proposed representation provides a high level reasoning tool for human behaviour modelling. This approach deals with deterministic and uncertainty reasoning with influence of personality and supports user-defined personality models in simulated military operators. This research shows the possibility to integrate the reasoning with personality effects into performance simulation engines in CGFs for improving current HBR.},

  pages={767-771},
  abstract={Neural Style Transfer (NST) currently leads the artistic creation field that combines artistry with technological innovation, well master the advanced of Convolution neural network (CNN) makes image manipulation easy and with creative flair. This paper suggests the optimized approach for NST which includes a dataset selection, choosing the type model architecture, learning strategies and, all-inclusive evaluation metrics. Through meticulous experimentation, we explore four distinct dimensions of NST applications: face painting, super-slow-motion, interactive, user-customization, real-time performance along online social media. In investigating superior style transfer our product highlights the highest perceptual matching, faithful style representation, and content preservation metrics ensuring the fulfillment of artistic style without deformation of the original content. Model efficiency is achieved by introducing optimized model architectures and fast training strategies, which, in turn, provide for responsive style transfer in real time with as little latency and resource consumption as possible. This is done by adapting models within a specific artistic domain through up-tuning models which will be the source of style transfer that can be tweaked in a manner that caters for any artistic domain. Therefore, the paper research is fundamental because of the management of the user’s experience by user-guided interaction, which has given interactive controls and real-time feedback that assist the users to customize stylization according to their likes and dislikes. Gratifying user scoring demonstrates the power of user-directed style transfer as a means of furthering users’ engagement and artistry.t.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={The use of social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, WeChat, and others have grown exponentially over time with the growth of the Internet and has become the most influential networking platforms in the 21st century. They are well-known for their low-cost, quick, and effective communication. However, the enhancement of social connectivity often creates negative impacts on society that contributes to online abuse, harassment, cyberbullying, cyber flashing, cybercrime, and online trolling. In this paper, we are focusing on cyber-flashing, the unsolicited sending of nude or sexual images, which is a common practice but often met with negative reactions from receivers. During and after COVID lockdown, cyber-flashing has been a serious threat on WhatsApp recently. The majority of study, meanwhile, has focused on identifying instances of cyberbullying rather than the effects of cyber-flashing. Cyber-flashing is the act of sending an inappropriate photo or video to another person, as well as exposing oneself to another via live video. An essential step in the detection of cyber-flashing is evaluating the level of risk in terms of abusiveness in the provided picture, or video. Therefore, the goal of this research is to create and refine a method that can effectively identify abusive cyber-flashing content and prevent inappropriate content sharing within the social media platforms or public Wi-Fi network. As a result, we have proposed a unique technique, where we employ a multi- stage model for identifying cyber-flashing photos and the proposed YOLOv3-YCbCr performs best in terms of metrics, with 98.14% accuracy, 95.58% specificity, and 97.27% sensitivity. First, the YOLOv3 technique is used to detect human presence in the image. Then, the YCbCr model is used for the skin detection and analysis. In the context of intelligent systems, skin detection is a difficult topic that has drawn a lot of attention from specialists and experts from the research community; the lack of uniform testing methodologies and standard benchmarks have made it difficult to compare different approaches fairly. Based on our studies, YOLOv3-YCbCr performs far better for skin segmentation than any prior hand-crafted approach method.},

  abstract={Over the past 20 years, wearable computing has emerged as the perfect tool for embodying humanistic intelligence (HI). HI is intelligence that arises when a human is part of the feedback loop of a computational process in which the human and computer are inextricably intertwined. It is common in the field of human-computer interaction to think of the human and computer as separate entities. (indeed, the term "HCI" emphasizes this separateness by treating the human and computer as different entities that interact.) However, in HI theory, we prefer not to think of the wearer and the computer with its associated I/O apparatus as separate entities. Instead, we regard the computer as a second brain and its sensory modalities as additional senses, in which synthetic synesthesia merges with the wearer's senses. When a wearable computer functions in a successful embodiment of HI, the computer uses the human's mind and body as one of its peripherals, just as the human uses the computer as a peripheral. This reciprocal relationship is at the heart of HI.},

  pages={301-305 vol.1},
  abstract={As the classroom paradigm shifts from being teacher-centered to being learner-centered, student assessments are evolving from paper-and-pencil testing to other methods of evaluation. Students should be probed for understanding, reasoning and critical thinking abilities rather than their ability to return memorized facts. The Department of Energy's pilot program, Adventures in Supercomputing (AiS), offers one example of assessment techniques developed for learner-centered curricula. The goals and objectives that are central to student learning in the AiS program involve the acquisition of thinking and problem-solving skills. School students are involved in a year-long computational science project. To complete the project, students employ the following tools: (1) the Internet to aid in researching their topics and communicating with their mentors, (2) computers to develop and test models of the problems, and (3) visualization software to understand their data. From these resources, students must pose hypotheses, devise methods for solutions, conduct appropriate simulations and draw proper conclusions. The assessment of the AiS program has employed a variety of methods to collect student data. THe methods of assessment used were traditional testing, performance testing, interviews, questionnaires via e-mail, and student presentations of projects. The data obtained have been analyzed by a professional assessment team. The results have been used to improve the AiS curriculum and establish the quality of the overall AiS program. This paper discusses the methods of assessment used and the results.},

  abstract={With the development of science and technology, many industries begin to use computer technology to improve work efficiency. From the facts of many practices, we can see that computer technology is a good technology for many industries and can bring many benefits to the industry. Computer technology is also deepening into legal practice. In legal practice, modeling, simulation and other calculation methods can be used to analyze legal relations, so that legal information can be transformed from traditional analysis to an information and intelligent system with higher efficiency and accuracy. The inclusion classification in legal procedures can be simply summarized as a model, and the eigenvalue table structure is built to make the case enter the computer into data that can be calculated and judged. This method simplifies the case trial and makes the case context clearer. The deep integration of Computational Thinking and legal thinking is conducive to enrich and develop the basic theory of law, improve the scientificity and coordination of various departments in the judicial system, and improve the efficiency of the judicial system. Computer technology plays a positive role in improving legislative and judicial efficiency, coping with and avoiding technical risks.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={145-158},
  abstract={In this paper, we introduce the Tensor Streaming Processor (TSP) architecture, a functionally-sliced microarchitecture with memory units interleaved with vector and matrix deep learning functional units in order to take advantage of dataflow locality of deep learning operations. The TSP is built based on two key observations: (1) machine learning workloads exhibit abundant data parallelism, which can be readily mapped to tensors in hardware, and (2) a simple and deterministic processor with producer-consumer stream programming model enables precise reasoning and control of hardware components, achieving good performance and power efficiency. The TSP is designed to exploit parallelism inherent in machine-learning workloads including instruction-level, memory concurrency, data and model parallelism, while guaranteeing determinism by eliminating all reactive elements in the hardware (e.g. arbiters, and caches). Early ResNet50 image classification results demonstrate 20.4K processed images per second (IPS) with a batch-size of one— a $4 \times$ improvement compared to other modern GPUs and accelerators [44]. Our first ASIC implementation of the TSP architecture yields a computational density of more than 1 TeraOp/s per square mm of silicon for its $25 \times 29$ mm 14nm chip operating at a nominal clock frequency of 900 MHz. The TSP demonstrates a novel hardware-software approach to achieve fast, yet predictable, performance on machine-learning workloads within a desired power envelope.},

  year={2007},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={This paper proposes an alternative concept for handling dynamic provisioning changes and ongoing network reconfiguration and reoptimization in general. A prime motivation is concern about the dependency of existing concepts for dynamic provisioning on the real-time coherence of databases of network state at diverse geographic locations. Not only is the continual updating of such global state everywhere in the network an intensive real-time load, but inevitable incoherencies pose hazards in network operation. The alternative proposal is a framework that makes use of precise time synchronization and the computational power of network nodes to solve identical local instances of incremental reoptimization problems in situ. The scheme removes the database coherency hazard, reduces signaling volumes, and increases resource efficiencies in service provisioning. It also provides a framework in general for continually ongoing distributed reoptimization of network configuration. The proposal also points directions towards some new research questions such as implementation of optimization models for identical solution on disparate platforms and definition of a variety of incremental batch reoptimization problems. It is thought that this may be one of the first application concepts for transport network management that would involve on-line embedded use of operations research methods in communication networks.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={29-41},
  abstract={This paper first presents an input-stationary (IS) implemented crossbar accelerator (INCA), supporting inference and training for deep neural networks (DNNs). Processing-in-memory (PIM) accelerators for DNNs have been actively researched, specifically, with resistive random-access memory (RRAM), due to RRAM’s computing and memorizing capabilities and device merits. To the best of our knowledge, all previous PIM accelerators have saved weights into RRAMs and inputs (activations) into conventional memories—it naturally forms weight-stationary (WS) dataflow. WS has generally been considered the most optimized choice for high parallelism and data reuse. How-ever, WS-based PIM accelerators show fundamental limitations: first, remaining high dependency on DRAM and buffers for fetching and saving inputs (activations); second, a remarkable number of extra RRAMs for transposed weights and additional computational intermediates in training; third, coarse-grained arrays demanding high-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and introducing poor utilization in depthwise and pointwise convolution; last, degraded accuracy due to its sensitivity to weights which are affected by RRAM’s nonideality. On the other hand, we observe that IS dataflow, where RRAMs retain inputs (activations), can effectively address the limitations of WS, because of low dependency by only loading weights, no need for extra RRAMs, feasibility of fine-grained accelerator design, and less impact of input (activation) variance on accuracy. But IS dataflow is hardly achievable by the existing crossbar structure because it is difficult to implement kernel sliding and preserve the high parallelism. To support kernel movement, we constitute a cell structure with two-transistor-one-RRAM (2T1R). Based on the 2T1R cell, we design a novel three-dimensional (3D) architecture for high parallelism in batch training. Our experiment results prove the potential of INCA. Compared to the WS accelerator, INCA achieves up to 20.6× and 260× energy efficiency improvement in inference and training, respectively; 4.8× (inference) and 18.6× (training) speedup as well. While accuracy in WS drops to 15% in our high-noise simulation, INCA presents an even more robust result as 86% accuracy.},

  abstract={The soroban is a traditional arithmetic tool whose life in modern Japan reflected an inherently material dimension of computational numeracy. Using a system of commands to carry out operations, the soroban was both doubted and enthusiastically embraced by educators as a way of teaching basic mathematics, sparking conversations of what it really meant to understand arithmetic. Despite the introduction of Western-style pen and paper arithmetic, it persisted as the standard tool of computing in households, businesses, and bureaucracy, driving the Taylorist training of human calculators who could apply its commands with corporal discipline and the design of mechanical calculators that simplified its procedures. Even when educators held an “intuitive” ideal of mental calculation that moved students away from calculating with physical tools, the soroban persevered as a virtual interface that calculators accessed in their minds.},

  pages={3801-3802},
  abstract={Collaborative filtering (CF) from implicit datasets has attracted much attention in recent years. The current mainstream pairwise methods optimize the Area Under the Curve (AUC) and are empirically proven to be helpful to exploit implicit feedback, but lead to not addressing the rank-biased scenarios where positive items are supposed to be placed on the top-k positions. Although there exist listwise methods, they have low efficiency and are not particularly adequate for general implicit feedback situations. To that end, in this paper, we propose a new framework, namely Collaborative List-and-Pairwise Filtering (CLAPF), which aims to introduce pairwise thinking into listwise methods. Specifically, we first smooth a well-known rank-biased measure called Mean Average Precision (MAP) as a low-bound version to make it can be optimized. After that, we combined the objective functions of optimizing the MAP with pairwise comparisons. The CLAPF framework is a new hybrid model that provides the idea of utilizing a listwise measure in a pairwise way on implicit feedback.},

  abstract={Automatic extraction of human opinions from Web documents has been receiving increasing interest.

With the growing availability and popularity of opinion-rich resources such as online review sites and personal blogs, new opportunities and challenges arise as people can, and do, actively use information technologies to seek out and understand the opinions of others. The sudden eruption of activity in the area of opinion mining, which deals with the computational treatment of opinion and subjectivity in text, has thus occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a first-class object. In this paper, we demonstrate an opinion mining framework that extracts the opinions and views of the consumers/customers, and analyze them to provide concrete market flow along with proven statistical data. The software uses classification, clustering and lingual knowledge-based opinion mining for providing these features.},

Cyber attacks either come from black hackers or cyber warfare units. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have played an important role in developing efficient cyber security tools. This paper presents Latest Cyber Security Tools Based on Machine Learning which are: Windows defender ATP, DarckTrace, Cisco Network Analytic, IBM QRader, StringSifter, Sophos intercept X, SIME, NPL, and Symantec Targeted Attack Analytic.},

  abstract={Existing cloud frameworks involve isolating low-level operations within an application for data distribution and partitioning. This limits their applicability for many applications with complex data dependency considerations. This paper aims to explore new methods of partitioning and distributing data in the cloud by fundamentally re-thinking the way in which future data management models will need to be developed on the Internet. Loosely-coupled associative computing techniques, which have so far not been considered, can provide the break-through needed for a distributed data management scheme. Using a novel lightweight associative memory algorithm known as Edge Detecting Hierarchical Graph Neuron (Edge HGN), data retrieval/processing can be modeled as a pattern recognition problem, conducted across multiple records within a single-cycle, utilizing a parallel approach. The proposed model envisions a distributed data management scheme for large-scale data processing and database updating that is capable of providing scalable real-time recognition and processing with high accuracy while being able to maintain low computational cost in its function.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) and Blockchain are increasingly growing focus on research. Blockchain is like the Internet when we first knew of it. This new technology could revolutionize how we do everything. Seriously, everything. Think how the Internet changed our daily lives today. And just like that, we don't really have to understand the technology behind it and be knowledge of its importance. But what makes this innovation revolution a bigger deal than Bitcoin and possibly even the Internet itself, are the exponential opportunities the concept provides. However, the potential to integrated Blockchain to Internet of Things (IoT) has constraint due to the required high computational power. IoT comprises of numerous platforms which have limited performance. Usually, these platforms cannot handle intensive procedures and often has scalability issues. In this paper, we give an overview of consensus algorithms and the necessity of this method to blockchain technology. Moreover, we focused on three of the utmost common consensus algorithms used in blockchain technology and explore their potential adaptation in an IoT framework with respect to its requirements.},

This software tool is open-source and it was programmed using Python3 language. It was created with the purpose of offering students an alternative software tool with a low computational cost. It was made thinking in providing a great user experience to the students when they are learning about process dynamics and closed-loop system behavior based on proportional-integral and derivative controllers. In particular, the real-time simulation mode, provides to the user an interactive way to understand the meaning of each parameter in classical second order process models or in PID controllers and, hence it could become in a useful tool in careers as electrical engineering.},

  abstract={eScience is now an example field for conducting science using advanced computational methodologies, middle-ware and workflows. With the ever-increasing data intensity in various scientific disciplines and the opportunities provided by novel artificial intelligence (AI) and computing techniques, there is a pressing need for eScience to adapt and develop holistic approaches for AI-integrated science and interdisciplinary collaboration between science, AI and computing experts. This paper discusses the transformative shift needed in the conduct and tools of eScience from traditional workflows, often linear, pre-defined to coordinate task execution and individually developed, to integrated “teamflows”, a term coined to encapsulate methods for effective team collaboration and communication, dynamic data and service integration, and use-inspired thinking. In the AI in science era of scientific investigation, this “future of eScience” special track paper: 1) emphasizes the vital importance of eScience to the success of collaborative AI in science teams; 2) recites some requirements for open data and services for AI-enhanced workflows, team science and incentive structures to create a more inclusive and efficient discovery environment; and 3) discusses impact as a measure of success in eScience.},

  abstract={Lacking student preparation before class has been the most commonly identified challenge when adopting the flipped classroom approach. In this study, we have introduced a class activity which can increase student pre-class online engagement and help them better prepare for the in-class activity. During this activity, students are required to work in small groups before in-class activities to answer open-ended questions related to the course learning materials via an online shared document. Based on teachers' duty, there are four stages for implementation of the proposed activity which are: (1) initiation: teacher needs to design open-ended questions and creates online shared editable documents for each group; (2) scaffolding: teacher assists learners in providing responses by checking their editing logs; (3) assessment: students' access to the online shared documents will be suspended and teacher will evaluate students responses; and (4) reflection: teacher will address common issues and propose more challenging questions before the related in-class activities. We have conducted experiments in the third cohort of a flipped general education course on computational thinking and algorithms. Except for the proposed class activity, the first two cohorts of this course have the same design and content in three topics and therefore worked as control groups. Online interaction data of all three cohorts have been collected for a thorough comparison. Results showed that students' average lecture video access rates have improved in the third cohort compared to the first two cohorts by 49 % and 39 % respectively. The percentage of students who never accessed any lecture videos decreased from around 29 % in the first and second cohorts to 6 % in the third cohort where the proposed activity was implemented. A statistically significant difference was discovered between the first and third cohorts (t = -15.06, p<; 0.00001), and between the second and third cohorts (t = _27.02, p<; 0.00001) of the course in lecture video access rates.},
