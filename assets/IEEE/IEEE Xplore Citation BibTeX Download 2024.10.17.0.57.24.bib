  abstract={Modeling of a phenomenon plays a key role in scientific thinking, and therefore an important issue in teaching science. Formulation of a model depends on methods to manipulate it. So far, differential equations have played a major role in scientific modeling because of model analysis using mathematics. However, with progress of information technology, computer simulation gets a powerful method to handle models, and individual-based and more procedural model such as an agent-based model can be another alternative in modeling. This study discusses an agent-based model of flue infection developed for teaching science and computer in a project-based learning (PBL) course in a senior high school. Course practice showed that the agent-based approach was effective in learning of modeling and simulation by experience.},

  abstract={The article explores the concept of knowledge and knowledge models concerning their application in evaluating the assimilation of methodological knowledge. It analyzes the benefits of employing test formats for assessment in the learning process and their influence on the enhancement of students’ critical thinking and analytical skills. The potential for automating the generation of test sets using computer technologies is investigated. A framework for formalizing problem scenarios based on ontology models is proposed, aiming to organize and generalize knowledge in this domain. A method for generating problem scenarios to assess methodological knowledge is developed, leveraging computer algorithms and artificial intelligence. This approach facilitates the creation of high-quality test sets with diverse tasks and scenarios, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of evaluating students’ knowledge. Through experimental research, a system of variable parameters is identified, enabling the customization of test sets to different student groups and educational contexts. The results obtained validate the efficacy of the proposed method and underscore its significance in enhancing the assessment and teaching of methodological knowledge in educational settings.},

  abstract={Sentiment analysis is a field within natural language processing that seeks to recognize and extract personal and emotional data from textual information, including feelings, viewpoints, and attitudes. Reviews have now turned into an indispensable data source for both consumers and businesses. Analyzing the sentiment of such reviews can offer valuable ideas into customers' likes, contentment, and discontentment. In recent times, Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) has paved new paths in the area of Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing. In our work, sentiment of people is analyzed through reviews taken from people of various age groups from different educational backgrounds to understand the efficiency of ChatGPT. A comparative analysis was carried out by using four different machine learning models and two hybrid models using SVM + Decision Tree and Random Forest + Logistic Regression. The survey also analyzed various effects of using ChatGPT and how it contributes in making people lethargic and decreases logical thinking ability and problem-solving skills.},

  abstract={With the world becoming more and more reliant on technology, we are transitioning from a society that values rational evaluation over intuitive thinking to one in which both of those methods coexist. AI devices rely solely on rational evaluation and machine learning allows us to focus on intuition. The task of intelligence is to deduce which method should be relied upon when solving various problems via the establishment of realistic judgments, according to what kind it identifies as being best for that particular problem. However, human judgments cannot simply be quantitatively compared and ranked by a computer according to conditions set by algorithms because certain difficult-to-measure criteria are not easily passable through algorithm systems such as ethics and common sense. In this research, the authors focus on developing judgment classification models using random forest and support vector machine. The authors attempt to test the effectiveness of sentiment proportions as features in judgment classification models.},

  title={Investigating Persuasive Behaviors Across Different Opinion Polarities: A Study of Video Messages}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1176-1180},
  abstract={Interpreting subjectively what makes a person persuasive in online videos is a complex and dynamic process that requires critical thinking and active engagement from the part of the observer. With the rapid expansion of online communication through social networking websites, more persuasive content is made available online in the form of video. The use of positive and/or negative opinions might affect how persuasive someone appears to be. Persuasiveness is at the core of everyday human-human interactions, such as defending a client in a court, seeking a patient's compliance with medical advice or convincing a customer to buy a product. This study is motivated by the argument that persuasive behavior changes with opinion polarity and whether a speaker is trying to persuade one in favor of or against something. Emotion plays a key role in persuasion both in verbal and non-verbal communication, therefore understanding the impact of opinion polarity (sentiment) on the persuasive messages becomes increasingly important. The study aims to explain the” emotion” behind the message as expressed in negative and positive opinions both persuasive and unpersuasive videos. The data used for the analysis is derived from Persuasive Opinion Multimedia (POM) dataset which is an online multimodal dataset with existing labels for persuasive and non-persuasive videos placed in two sentiment or opinion polarities (positive and negative). This research paper also introduced a new neuromarketing assessment method called NeuroMap's NeuroScoring tool, previously designed to evaluate persuasive messages through a neuromarketing perspective. The present study results align with the NeuroMap model's emphasis on the role of emotions in persuasion. The persuasion model suggests that emotions directly impact how people process and memorize information and how persuasive messages that evoke positive emotions are more likely to be effective. In the study, sentiment levels can be seen as indicators of emotional content conveyed in the video messages, and the positive relationship between sentiment levels and persuasiveness supports the view that emotional appeal plays a crucial role in influencing persuasion.},

  volume={42},

  pages={1529-1542},
  abstract={Recursive reasoning of the form what do I think that you think that I think (and so on) arises often while acting in multiagent settings. Previously, multiple experiments studied the level of recursive reasoning generally displayed by humans while playing sequential general-sum and fixed-sum, two-player games. The results show that subjects experiencing a general-sum strategic game display first or second level of recursive thinking with the first level being more prominent. However, if the game is made simpler and more competitive with fixed-sum payoffs, subjects predominantly attributed first-level recursive thinking to opponents thereby acting using second level. In this article, we model the behavioral data obtained from the studies using the interactive partially observable Markov decision process, appropriately simplified and augmented with well-known models simulating human learning and decision. We experiment with data collected at different points in the study to learn the models parameters. Accuracy of the predictions by our models is evaluated by comparing them with the observed study data, and the significance of the fit is demonstrated by comparing the mean squared error of our model predictions with those of a random hypothesis. Accuracy of the predictions by the models suggest that these could be viable ways for computationally modeling strategic behavioral data in a general way. While we do not claim the cognitive plausibility of the models in the absence of more evidence, they represent promising steps toward understanding and computationally simulating strategic human behavior.},

  abstract={This paper presents a novel algorithm for the Vertex Cover problem, inspired by the Think-Like-A-Vertex (TLAV) paradigm. The Vertex Cover problem, a fundamental challenge in graph theory, finds significant relevance in the context of the compute continuum, where the optimal placement of application images across a diverse range of computational resources is a critical concern. Our proposed TLAV-based algorithm addresses this challenge by leveraging local information at each vertex to make intelligent decisions, thereby reducing the global complexity of the problem. While this approach could potentially lead to resource overprovisioning, we argue that in the context of the compute continuum, this trade-off can provide more flexibility and redundancy, enhancing the reliability of the system. Through extensive analysis and experimental results, we demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our algorithm on large-scale graphs, making a significant contribution to the field of resource management in the compute continuum.},

  abstract={The application of Grid technology is at the transition from engineering and natural science-related industrial sectors to other industries that have a high demand for computing resources. However, the diffusion of Grid technology within industrial sectors which are not naturally engineering and natural science-related is often hindered by a lack of incentives to share the computational resources. A promising way to overcome these barriers is the introduction of economically inspired mechanisms for the use of Grid-based resources. Our work introduces a iterated cost-based multi-unit resource auction (CMRA) and compares a traditional cost-based accounting approach with dedicated servers as well as a pooling approach with regard to service quality and total costs. The cost-calculus used in our model is based on costs for the delayed processing of jobs and costs for the cancellation of these jobs if the job cannot be provided at a certain time span in the worst case. The simulation results indicate that pooling of IT resources by Grid technology can produce a reduction of 20.3% in cost within this model compared to dedicated servers in the computing centers. However, with the CMRA-based allocation of computing resources, a further 1.4% of cost reduction can be achieved while the achieved quality-of-service (QoS) can be significantly increased. Finally we think that there must be a further cost reduction potential for Grid solutions beyond these savings that can be achieved by using economically inspired allocation methods that are combined with advanced refining and learning methods.},

  abstract={It is shown that the fundamental basis and the primary basis for the concepts in the field of algorithmization of modern intelligent systems lie in the philosophical knowledge of the world and the process of thinking as such. It is indicated that the creation of modern artificial intelligent systems is based primarily on the knowledge of the actual thinking of the person, his ability to create different ways, mechanisms, tools of intellectual activity. It is emphasized that algorithms are practically the first among them and have now become one of the main ways of building intelligent systems. It is stated that the theory of algorithms itself, as one of the basic and fundamental branches of mathematics, transforming in its time from philosophy, is based on studies of epistemology, the subject of which is the process of human knowledge as such, in its entirety. It is presented from the position of epistemology and ontology as fundamental sections for the philosophy that the creation of modern integrated modules of information technology systems is unthinkable without taking into account the complex of relationships, interactions in the system "man-machine", and algorithms are the leading way to develop any artificial systems, including intelligent systems. Science is an important area of human activity, always aimed at the development and systematization of objective knowledge about the real world.},
