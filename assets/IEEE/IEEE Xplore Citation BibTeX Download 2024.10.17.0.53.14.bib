  abstract={The serious geological hazards occurred frequently in the last few years, which have caused heavy casualties and severe economic losses. It is necessary to design a geological information service system to analyze and evaluate geological hazards. With the development of computer and Internet service model, it is now possible to obtain rich data and process the data with some advanced computing techniques under network environment. Some technologies, including cyber-physical-system (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing, have been used in geological information management. Furthermore, the concept of cyber-physical-social-thinking (CPST) as a broader vision of the IoT was presented through the fusion of those advanced computing technologies. Motivated by it, in this paper we develop a novel modeling and computing method for geological information service system in consideration of the complex data processing requirement of geological service under dynamic environment. Specifically, some key techniques of modeling the information service system and computing geological data via CPS and IoT are discussed. Moreover, the security issue of the proposed system is also analyzed.},

  abstract={With the increasing complexity of data types, the workload of software development is also increasing, and the later maintenance of software becomes very difficult. According to statistics, the vulnerability related to complex data processing occupies a large proportion of software vulnerabilities. The existence of software vulnerability makes the software system vulnerable to attack and affects the reliability of the software system. In this paper, the upper computer system uses the HashMap structure to store the query data directly in the structure and reduce the mapping process from data to table objects. After that, the rationality of the system module is analyzed by building a complex network model, and the robustness of the system is improved by finding the key nodes.},

  abstract={Our study is set in an educational context: to better teach and assess 21st-century skills, such as computational thinking or creative problem solving, we propose to formalize a specific activity that involves these competencies. This activity, referred to as #CreaCube, is presented as an open-ended problem which consists of assembling a set of robotic cubes into an autonomous vehicle. We not only anchor our formalization in classical learning science frameworks but we also propose to draw on neuro-cognitive models to describe the observed behaviors of learners engaged in this activity. The chosen formalism is symbolic and is aligned on upper ontologies to ensure that the vocabulary is well specified. This allows for a better communication between the summoned research fields, namely, learning science, cognitive neuroscience, and computational modeling. Beyond this specification purpose, we suggest performing inferences using available reasoners to better guide the analysis of the observables collected during the experiments. This operationalization of a creative problem-solving activity is part of an exploratory research action. In addition, an effective proof of concept is described in this study.},

  abstract={Jeannette Wing's seminal computational thinking (CT) paper, published in 2006, set forth CT as not just a way of looking at computational problems, but as an alternative approach to solving everyday problems. We strongly support Wing's assertion. Accordingly, we report the results of our meta-analysis of CT curricular implementations since 2006. Our principle interest is in CT framings and implementations for K-12 audiences in disciplines other than computer science, thus fulfilling the broad appeal and utility originally prescribed by Wing. We break CT down into its constituent characteristics, and split these characteristics into two principle groups: mechanistic (inextricably tied to and limited by computer science) and humanistic (separable from and adaptable beyond computer science). We use this conceptual bifurcation as a basis for selecting and analyzing implementations of CT for subsequent reporting. We summarize our CT meta-analytical results by distributional themes including grades, disciplinary foci, equity groups, and programming paradigms. In conclusion, we make recommendations for improving K-12 CT curricular implementations. Our hope is that utilization of CT characteristics and principles will become more commonplace in public education, be utilized more continuously through primary and secondary grades, and be inventively applied across a more inclusive range of academic disciplines.},

  abstract={Quantum mechanics is a fundamental, axiom-based physical theory that describes and explains phenomena that Classical Mechanics and Electrodynamics are unable to describe. It is considered a cross disciplinary STEM field, advancing the philosophy of Quantum Literacy (QL), which focuses on nature’s real complex problems. QL addresses the challenges of computing skills acquisition, through problem-based activities to offer powerful knowledge to a wide group of learners. Therefore, quantum technology knowledge should be accessible to students and teachers, in a more interactive way. In this paper, we propose contemporary and Problem based scenarios, in which students may acquire stronger mathematical, computational and modelling skills, working as real researchers. Thus, they acquire all necessary knowledge related to quantum principles, such as superposition, teleportation, entanglement, quantum gates and quantum information. The serious games we propose, relate to strategic games, within the computational thinking 2.0 framework. Certain Python libraries and packages are used and the didactic approach is based on game-based inquiry learning.},

  abstract={This work contributes to the comprehension of Bayes’ theorem inclusive Bayesian probabilities and Bayesian inferencing within the framework of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) and cognitive learning w.r.t Bloom’s taxonomy (BT). Bayes’ theorem is taken as a crucial statistical instrument employed in the development of intelligent systems and the management of risks, commonly utilized by engineers for tasks in machine learning and managerial decision-making. The fundamental concept behind Bayes’ theorem revolves around comprehending the degree of truth within the confines of an explicit perspective. This involves partitioning the entire sample space of possible evidence and utilizing the subset containing the relevant perspective to estimate the uncertainty of an event or the reliability of a model. However, it is often found difficult for students to understand Bayes’ theorem to the level of applying it to real-world problems. Considering this, the proposed learning method in this paper elucidated the acquisition of Bayes’ mathematical formulation by leveraging computational thinking, leading to the development of a computational model. The proposed model is named the Bayesian Computational Learning Model (BCLM). Subsequently, we have probed the utility of BCLM in the design and plan of learning activities, coherent to the STEM paradigm and BT cognitive learning hierarchy.},

The creative solutions that come from joint thinking-from the combined knowledge and abilities of people with diverse perspectives-contrast with traditional views of creativity that focus primarily on the individual as the main contributor of creativity. In an effort to support social creativity in organizations, in this paper we present computational intelligence software tools for that aim and an architecture for creating software mashups based on the concept of affinity space. The affinity space defines a digital setting to facilitate specific scenarios in collaborative business environments. The solution presented includes a set of free and open source software tools ranging from newly developed brainstorming applications to an expertise recommender for enhancing social creativity in the enterprise.

The advantages of using robots include the ability to carry out a psychodrama alone and to provide privacy-friendly support.

  abstract={Computational Archival Science (CAS) has been proposed as a trans-disciplinary field that combines computational and archival thinking. To provide grounded evidence, a foundational paper explored eight initial themes that constitute potential building blocks [1]. In order for a CAS community to emerge, further studies are needed to test this framework. While the foundational paper for CAS provides a conceptual and theoretical basis of this new field, there is still a need to articulate useful guidelines and checkpoints that validate a CAS research agenda. In this position paper, we propose heuristics for assessing emerging CAS-related studies that researchers from traditional fields can use in their research design stage. The Human Face of Big Data project, a digital curation and interface design project for urban renewal data, is presented and analyzed to demonstrate the validity of the suggested heuristics. Finally, implications for CAS and future work are discussed.},

  abstract={Computational modeling faces two major challenges. First, because modeling has demonstrated its value for relatively simple tasks, practitioners are asking for help with tasks in increasingly complex domains. Second, as international interchanges increase in importance, military, corporate, and humanitarian leaders urgently need to capture and better understand national and regional differences. Computational modeling promises to be a powerful tool for representing complex tasks and testing the validity of these representations. Models might also support decision aids and serve as platforms for training. It's time to extend modeling to better accommodate complexity and to include the variations in behavior, roles, values, and cognition that influence international interchange.},

  year={2021},
  volume={},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={From time immemorial, stories have caught the fascination of young and old. Rural children in India, in particular, have a natural way of telling stories that are rooted in their heritage of social norms, values, and belief systems that are compelling and emotionally engaging. The process of writing and narrating their own stories enhances their verbal proficiency and makes them reflect deeply upon the story theme, thereby enabling them to develop higher-order thinking. In this research study, the author used stories to introduce physical computing and robotics to children in rural India in a personally meaningful manner. Children created interactive cultural dioramas based on classical stories from Indian folklore with robotic puppets that they programmed using the Scratch programming language. They learned 21st-century skills of creativity, communication, collaboration, and critical thinking by working in groups wherein they learned to divide tasks, manage time, work together, debate the pros and cons of different ideas, listen, think out of the box, and be active and engaged. The author observed that such an intervention improved the children's sense of agency and their interest in robotics and computational thinking. The author presents her results from pilot studies conducted in 2019 from two semi-urban schools in India on the children's perception of creating robots, programming, tinkering with electronics, career in robotics, and the workshop experience itself - all of which suggests that the children were deeply engaged and enthusiastic throughout the workshop making the entire learning experience a meaningful and joyful one for all. The results indicate that such culturally sensitive interventions can help children from collectivistic cultures embrace technology while preserving their traditional identities and cultural cohesion.},

Pictograms are constructed objects at a high level of abstraction. Abstraction, decomposition, and pattern recognition, which are all core concepts of computational thinking, are also essential ability for pictogram content creation. And if the structure of pictograms can be described as a procedural program, then it is based on algorithmic thinking. Pictoch especially focuses on human pictogram. This effect of the human pictogram can be familiar with “syntonic learning.” advocated by Papert. Pictoch has the instructions for posing and motion of human pictogram, and some more essential functions for making pictograms that drawing various objects and attaching safety signs. This paper introduces this application and describes its various basic functions and additional functions for class use.},

  abstract={Research shows that improving students' understanding of Computational Thinking (CT) in unplugged, science-based courses benefits their understanding of algorithmic thinking. This paper describes use of the APP approach, a UDL-based guideline of self-regulation for problem formulation and problem solving, and then presents a program of lessons designed to improve a student's CT skills through improvement of executive functioning and higher-level cognitive skills, using the APP framework to explore the field of solar weather, an underrepresented but relevant topic for 6-12 grade students. The approach has strong resonances with the POWER approach to expository writing, the scientific method, and software engineering.},

  abstract={At present, there is still a lack of suitable artificial intelligence curriculum in primary and secondary schools in China. Based on a project-based learning model, an artificial intelligence course was designed for middle school-aged students. Learning objectives were deconstructed according to the five concepts of artificial intelligence, and learning contents were arranged according to the cognitive characteristics of middle school students. In the process of teaching, the cultivation of students' computational thinking ability was paid great attention, and teaching example was given at the end of the paper.},

  abstract={One of the most important skills for a biochemist these days is to be able to visualize a protein, find a ligand binding site, and show the three-dimensional interactions with the coordinated amino acid residues. It is important to educate a modern student how to benefit from the up-to-date scientific data and software. It is known that the primary structure of protein is of primary information content; however, the tertiary structure is more conserved. Biochemistry students are educated in a traditional way giving an importance to developing fundamental skills as well as critical thinking. In this article, we demonstrate educational approaches that incorporate computational methods in the course Biochemistry A–CHEM 370. This approach is developed at Loyola University Chicago and is based on a pedagogical method developed at Orenburg State Medical University.},
