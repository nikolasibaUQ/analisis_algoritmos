  abstract={One of the major limitations of current search engines is that users could not quickly locate what they want if the input query is too general. Some existing techniques try to cluster Web search results into groups so as to userpsilas quick browsing. In this paper, we present a new approach to categorize the Web search results by using YAGO ontology. It utilizes the YAGO ontology to automatically generate categories for the user's specific query and classify the search results into appropriate categories. Our experimental results indicate that our method is feasible and effectiveness.},

  abstract={Social relationship is explained under the fuzzy set and fuzzy logic theory. A model for describing the individual nature of mind in the fuzzy environment is presented first, then extended for groups, couples, and social relationship dealing with both perfect and approximate reasoning. The fuzzy social relationship as proposed here also devise that goals of one individual may be seen as constraints upon others, and vice-versa. In this sense, the proposed fuzzy social relationship description is a special case of fuzzy decision-making in fuzzy environment. Moreover, the social relationship is, actually, a simple case of logic mapping. According to the fuzzy social model, the common sense and the advantage of being flexible is emphasized mainly one is interested in a social relationship and in avoiding conflicts. The proposed approach addresses not only human beings, yet it can be extended to describe a sociological perspective of relationship, as well as to overall relationship between societies, nations by including trading and diplomacy.},

  abstract={Courses to train modeling competence are held in higher educational institutions. These courses focus on the final artifacts submitted by learners for analysis and/or evaluation and do not clarify the intermediate creation process. This study focuses on quality of the final class diagram submitted by learners and trials and errors during the creation process. We tried to verify a hypothesis that learners to create an artifact with good quality make a number of trials and errors during the editing process. We collected the fine-grained data regarding the editing history of class diagrams created by learners by our tool called KIfU. We verified the hypothesis by analyzing the collected data. First, we defined two metrics ("Number of editing" and "Number of movement" of symbols in the artifact) calculated from the data that show the learners' trials and errors. Second, we divided learners into two groups, group that created artifacts with good quality and that with not good quality. Finally, we compared the metrics between the groups. The results show that there are statistically significantly differences of values of both metrics between the groups. We conclude the hypothesis we set is correct from the result.},

Users can express opinions and record daily life using microblogs. Microblogs that are posted by users indicate their interests to some extent. But it seems very hard to analyze the sentiment hided in Chinese Micro text because of its complexity. This paper proposes a new way to determine the sentiment tendency of Chinese micro text based on the partitioned Sense Group (STDSG). When to judge the sentiment tendency of Micro text, we first partition it into separate sense group, and then determine it's sentiment tendency based on Emotional Dictionary. And We aslo consider various factors which contain negations, degree adverbs and punctuations. The effectiveness of STDSG is strongly supported by the results of our experiments.},

  abstract={Ontology is the basis component of the Semantic Web. Since constructing ontologies is a time consuming job for domain experts, many researches are conducted on automatic extraction of ontologies from texts. As the development of folksonomy, more and more researchers have realized that folksonomy is a better knowledge source for constructing ontologies than texts. Although some works have already been proposed to extract ontologies from folksonomies, these works have little consideration on what a more acceptable and applicable ontology for users should be, and lack an principle to supervise the ontology extraction from a human's perspective. According to the study in cognitive psychology, there is a family of concepts named basic level concepts, which are frequently used by people in daily life, and most human knowledge is expressed using basic level concepts. In this paper, inspired by studies in cognitive psychology, we try to extract ontologies with basic level concepts from folksonomies. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work on discovering basic level concepts in folksonomies and using them to construct ontologies.},

  abstract={This paper highlighted the key challenges impacting Management Education in India (MEI) in the current digitalized scenario, especially after COVID-19. Initially, an exploratory research design was utilized and then it was descriptive to analyze the collected data. The sample size was 100(valid responses) being the management educator of Meerut city as a sample unit. Table & Descriptive Statistics were used to define the data and ‘Correlation and Multiple Regression Analysis’ were used for calculating the outcomes. Major respondents were young-aged educators that truly believe in a challenging and dynamic MEI as of now. The crisis management ability was the most crucial challenge of MEI. "Industry orientation" and "international perspective" were not significant challenges. The study was highly practical because "MEI" has been undergoing a roundabout transformation in the current digitalized scenario, and there has been a paradigm shift in overall higher education following COVID-19. It was highly important because budding managers and forthcoming business leaders have to perform in a highly dynamic environment, and the paper was original as 100 primary responses of management educators in Meerut City were taken into account for study.},

This paper presents some new teaching methods of Digital Image Processing in an application-oriented college. In classroom presentation, more vivid illustrations and less formula derivations are given. While in laboratory exercises, students are instructed to develop some basic image processing functions commonly used in daily digital lives. This acts as a main clue for the whole course: with the progress of classroom teaching, various image processing features are gradually added to the softwares developed by students themselves. Following these methods, students are stimulated and remarkable teaching results are achieved.},

The current representative method of product definition applies situation based control of product feature parameters. In the presented method, application of situation control was improved by placing it from the product feature level to the product behavior level. Because the feature level situation control is a proven key technology in product lifecycle management systems, the new behavior level product definition process controls the process of the feature level product definition. This paper starts with a comparison of the feature and the behavior level product feature definition. Following this, the product request, product behavior, and context structure feature definitions are introduced as main elements of the behavior level product feature definition process. Next, a new context structure and its connection with the feature sequence is exampled and discussed. Finally, application of the proposed method in product lifecycle management systems is outlined.},

We demonstrate the effectiveness of an extreme learning machine (ELM) for classifying a number of different thoughts when given a relatively small amount of training samples from a 5-channel EEG headset. We transform the electroencephalograph (EEG) data to a set of features for the input of the ELM model by estimating the logarithmic power (LP) of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients, which corresponds to five different frequency bands. The ELM provides up to a 90% to 100% classification accuracy depending on training samples and number of hidden nodes, compared to 52% to 60% for a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). We also present a UI based on a state machine design that allows a person to accomplish certain activities via thought with a robotic arm.},

  abstract={With the rapid growth of knowledge resources and increasing individual learning demands of users, it has been becoming more and more important to establish a kind of more comprehensible, more available and more application-oriented knowledge learning mechanism. By studying the critical factors in knowledge learning, the paper firstly proposed a novel concept of extended topic map for knowledge learning, it embodies the multi-level, multi-granularity and inherent relevant characteristics of knowledge and realizes knowledge visualization display. And then we defined multi-layer Service-Oriented knowledge architecture with the extended topic map as infrastructure. Additionally, a system framework of the knowledge learning is designed and implemented. Finally, a demonstration is given to display the knowledge learning based on extended topic map.},
