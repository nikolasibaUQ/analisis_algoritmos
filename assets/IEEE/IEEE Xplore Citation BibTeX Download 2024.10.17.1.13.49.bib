  abstract={Social media has revolutionized the way individuals connect and share information globally. However, the rise of these platforms has led to the proliferation of cyber-hate, which is a significant concern that has garnered attention from researchers. To combat this issue, various solutions have been proposed, utilizing Machine learning and Deep learning techniques such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Recurrent Neural Networks. These methods rely on a mathematical approach to distinguish one class from another. However, when dealing with sentiment-oriented data, a more “critical thinking” perspective is needed for accurate classification, as it provides a more realistic representation of how people interpret online messages. Based on a literature review conducted to explore efficient classification techniques, this study applied two machine learning classifiers, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, to four online hate datasets. The results of the classifiers were optimized using bio-inspired optimization techniques such as Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithms, in conjunction with Fuzzy Logic, to gain a deeper understanding of the text in the datasets.},

  number={},
  pages={226188-226198},
  abstract={In traditional transductive learning, all queries are used in learning to rank in order to generate pseudo-labels when sufficient training data are not available. However, low quality queries may affect retrieval performance in transductive learning. We thus think that it is important to improve the quality of queries in transductive learning to train an effective ranking model. By using a small number of reliable samples and data close to the boundaries of classification, we propose building a query quality estimator by establishing a relationship between the benefits of good retrieval performance and features of the normalized query commitment that influence query quality. In our proposed transduction model, all queries available are filtered by the proposed query quality estimator and only high quality queries that enhance the effectiveness of retrieval such that they yield performance-related benefits, are used to generate pseudo-labels for learning to rank. Queries that can degrade performance benefits are discarded while creating the pseudo-labels. Pseudo-labels aggregated by high quality queries in transductive learning are then leveraged in learning to rank scenarios without sufficient training data. The results of extensive experiments on the standard LETOR 4.0 dataset showed that our proposed method can outperform strong baselines and the average normalized discounted cumulative gain is enhanced up to 7.77% in some case.},

  title={Deep Learning Techniques for Automated Dementia Diagnosis Using Neuroimaging Modalities: A Systematic Review}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={12},
  number={},
  pages={127879-127902},
  abstract={Dementia is a condition that often comes with aging and affects how people think, remember, and behave. Diagnosing dementia early is important because it can greatly improve patients’ lives. This systematic review looks at how deep learning (DL) techniques have been used to diagnose dementia automatically from 2012 to 2023. We explore how different DL methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are used to diagnose types of dementia such as Alzheimer’s, vascular dementia, and Lewy body dementia. We also discuss the difficulties of using DL for diagnosing dementia, like the lack of large and varied datasets and the challenge of applying models to different groups of people. These issues indicate the need for more dependable and understandable models that consider a wide range of patient characteristics and biomarkers. Longitudinal studies are also needed to understand how the disease progresses and how treatments work. Collaboration among researchers, doctors, and data scientists is crucial to ensure DL models are scientifically sound and effective in clinical settings. In summary, DL techniques show promise for automated dementia diagnosis and could improve how accurately and efficiently it is diagnosed in practice. However, further research is needed to address the challenges highlighted in this review.},

  title={Artificial Intelligence Blockchain Based Fake News Discrimination},

  volume={12},

  pages={53838-53854},
  abstract={This paper minimizes fake news, which has been a hot topic recently, using blockchain and artificial intelligence technology, and verifies it with blockchain. Also, using Artificial Intelligence technology, we want to create an algorithm that predicts how fake news will spread in the future. You can see various attempts at a news media platform based on Blockchain technology. However, the Blockchain news media platform is still not getting the market response we expected. It is questionable whether the reason is simply because it is a new technology, so it takes a long time to gain trust from consumers, whether consumers are not yet expecting an innovative news media platform, or whether the explosive growth of the Blockchain news media platform is difficult for other reasons. Research to answer this or direct research between Blockchain and media platforms is still lacking. In addition, the method of verifying fake news using artificial intelligence was verified, ANN, CBR, and MDA were changed, and the experiment was verified for progress. In addition, the use of 5-fold cross-validation as a comparative method was added as described above to more closely examine the possibility of its usefulness even in general situations. Also, through various fields of artificial intelligence and blockchain, verification work was done with blockchain, and fake news prediction was made using artificial intelligence. Various experiments were conducted and performance tests were performed, while the performance of about 5,000 TTPS was recorded through the third experiment. In the future, we think it is necessary to combine Artificial Intelligence and blockchain technology.},

  abstract={The pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 has allowed the proliferation of an unprecedented amount of data that must be organized and connected in a way that allows its efficient management. Nevertheless, the speed at which all of this knowledge is being generated has highlighted the shortcomings of the research community in creating well-organized, standardized, and structured databases. Despite the efforts of the community to develop advanced integrative platforms such as CovidGraph, we have identified some limitations when using these solutions that we think are derived from the lack of a sound ontological schema to guide the collection, standardization, and integration of data. This work explores the advantages and disadvantages for the final user of building advanced information systems using a Model Driven Development approach to integrate heterogeneous and complex data using an ontological background as a basis. As a proof of concept, we built a database (CovProt) to integrate data about different aspects of SARS-CoV-2 using this approach, we analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of using this approach compared to CovidGraph by performing a set of queries in CovProt and CovidGraph, and finally, we compared the structure and redundancy of the retrieved data.},

  abstract={This paper postulates a novel N-dimension computing machine that operates in an unconventional manner. This postulate aims at solving existing problems in higher dimensions, where one must re-think the scope of a given problem domain beyond the one-dimension Turing machine to dictate all subsequent problem representation, problem transformation, and algorithmic derivation. Two over-simplified well-known problems, namely, the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Tower of Hanoi problem are presented to demonstrate the point. Both synthetic problems are effectively adapted to solve a real world project. To realize the postulate in a viable architectural construct, data flow and molecular computers are investigated since they show potential computation power. Unfortunately, they are still confined to working in one-dimension domain. A biological-like architecture for software systems is proposed in three design aspects: structure, function, and behavior. Contributions of this work are to revamp traditional Turing computation paradigm to N-dimension computing machine, yet it is simple, straightforward, and implementable by state-of-the-practice hardware and software technologies. Thus, the burden of solving difficult problems can be lessened.},

  volume={12},

  pages={30113-30122},
  abstract={Recently, graph neural networks have achieved remarkable success in predicting molecular interactions. However, existing methodologies often fall short of comprehensively considering a pivotal factor influencing these interactions: the core subgraph within molecules, commonly represented by functional groups or atoms capable of engaging in interactions with other molecules. In this work, we propose a novel interaction prediction framework, called GIB-DS, which centers on the identification of the core subgraph in pairs of molecules to anticipate their interaction behavior. Guided by the principles of the Graph Information Bottleneck, our approach adeptly identifies two subgraphs within this pair of graphs that capture the essential information pertinent to the task at hand. We think that the dual-subgraph formulation could more faithfully capture the underlying nature of chemical reactions, where interactions between molecules and the interactions among specific atoms are inherently intertwined. Extensive experimentation across diverse datasets underscores the superiority of GIB-DS over state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an approximate 5% improvement. The GIB-DS code proposed can be found at https://github.com/LiLanQi/GIB_DS.},

  title={Detection and Prediction of Future Mental Disorder From Social Media Data Using Machine Learning, Ensemble Learning, and Large Language Models}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={12},
  number={},
  pages={120553-120569},
  abstract={Social media platforms are used widely by all people to express their feelings, opinions, and emotional states. Billions of people worldwide use them daily to share what they think and feel in their posts. Amongst all social media available platforms, Facebook only contains around three billion personal accounts. In this work Reddit dataset is used to automatically detect mental illness from social media posts. This study is not only limited to early detection of already existing mental illness or disorder like depression and anxiety from social posts, but also and most importantly the study is extended to predict successfully potential mental illness that would happen in future. This study deploys Nineteen different models to study the capability of them in detecting and predicting mental disorders from social media posts. Some of the deployed models are classical machine learning classifiers, some are ensemble learning models, and the rest are large language models (LLMs). Six machine learning classifiers were used in this work for the automatic detection and prediction of mental illness and logistic regression proved to be the best amongst other classifiers in this task. Nine Ensemble methods were also used and examined. Amongst the Nine ensemble learning models VC2, Light GBM, Bagging estimator, and XGBoost proved to be superior in this task. Four large language models were also used and examined for the same task. RoBERTa and OpenAI GPT proved to outperform the rest of models in this task. All those models were built, trained, tested, and compared with previous work in literature to get the best possible results. The study covers the main four mental disorders which are ADHD, Anxiety, Bipolar, and Depression. The work proposed in this paper succeeded in outperforming the results in literature in terms of number of addressed mental disorders, number of models used and tested, and dataset size used to validate results. The proposed work also outperformed the only attempt in literature that addressed all mental disorders in results of detection and prediction noticeably. This work achieved the detection of already existing mental disorders F1-score of 0.80 from clinical data and of 0.52 from non-clinical data, and it achieved a prediction of future mental disorder F1-score of 0.43 from non-clinical data.},

  title={DQQS: Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Technique for Enhancing Security and Performance in SDN-IoT Environments}, 
  year={2024},

  pages={60568-60587},
  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology that allow smart devices to communicate through various heterogeneous channels (wired or wireless). However, for conventional networks, it has become a challenging task to efficiently control and manage the data flows of a huge number of devices. Software-defined networking (SDN) is a new way of thinking about networking. Because it is programmable, flexible, agile, and gives you a big picture of the network, it has tried to solve some IoT problems, like scalability, heterogeneity, and complexity. In large-scale SDN-IoT networks, there is a requirement for routing protocols that are both efficient and secure in order to ensure a superior level of quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE). To address the above stated challenges, a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) known as DQQS model is proposed. The aim is to achieve QoS and QoE while also ensuring the security of the SDN-IoT network. The proposed DQQS model dynamically extracts patterns from the past network history by interacting with the underlying network and generating optimized routing policies. This article employs three network metrics—throughput, latency, and the probability of avoiding malicious nodes—to measure the performance of DQQS. Simulations reveal that the proposed framework outperforms four state-of-the-art routing algorithms: OSPF, L-L Routing, Sailfish Routing, and RL-Routing in terms of both throughput and latency. For instance, in an attacked environment, the proposed DQQS model achieved the highest throughput value of 14.5 Mbps, surpassing OSPF at 8 Mbps, L-L at 8.2 Mbps, Sailfish at 9 Mbps, and RL at 9.5 Mbps. Similarly, this model exhibited superior performance in latency, recording the lowest latency value of 52 ms, compared to OSPF 88 ms, L-L 85 ms, Sailfish 72 ms, and RL 75 ms routing algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that this new DQQS model is a pioneering deep reinforcement learning-based technique that optimally addresses secure routing in the SDN-IoT environment, ensuring enhanced quality of service and experience, and outperforming state-of-the art DL methodologies in both security and network performance metrics.},

  abstract={Information technologies are the base of the world infrastructure. In this social context, education, like any productive or service sector, is affected by technology. Faced with this reality, educational systems must prepare our young people to live in the digital world, for which they must be proficient in a new language without which they will become digital illiterates. Therefore, in school we should not only train in linguistic and numerical literacy, but also in digital literacy. So far, the effort has been oriented mainly to convert our young people into users of computer tools. This has gone from being necessary to being insufficient, because the use of software applications means to manage a digital language that is obsolete in a time that is not proportional, in effort, to the time that has been invested in acquiring these skills. Therefore, the challenge is to prepare our young people to face the world in which they live, giving them the necessary cognitive tools to succeed in the digital world. That is, instead of teaching students only the syntax of a changing language, they should be instructed in the rules that allow them to know how the digital language is constructed. Thus, computational thinking emerges as a paradigm of work, and the programming is stablished as the tool to solve problems.},

This talk reports results from a 10 year programme of research, engaging with collaborators who have been sought out precisely because their motivations, work methods and intentions are as different as possible from typical engineering programmers. These investigations have involved the development of a wide range of novel programmable systems and notations designed for use by choreographers, composers, musicians, and visual artists. The findings extend previous analyses of computational experience such as the attention investment model of abstraction use, and the cognitive dimensions of notations, drawing attention to ways of programming that are not only utilitarian, but playful and engaging. Research of this kind also helps us to understand that there are not necessarily different kinds of people in the world - those who are creative or not - but rather different ways of engaging with technology, available to all designers painting from the palette of human-centric computing systems.},

  abstract={Summary form only given. Recent interest in brain-computer interfaces has pushed development of decoding models that aim to classify, identify or reconstruct visual stimuli directly from measured brain activity. Most decoding models are based on non-parametric algorithms such as SVM and do not exploit current computational models of visual processing. We have pioneered an alternative approach in which the decoding algorithm is inferred from one or more explicit visual processing (nonlinear filtering) models. In previous work we showed that our approach extracts far more information from functional MRI measurements than was generally believed possible. In this task I will describe a new Bayesian decoding model that can actually reconstruct natural images that were seen by an observer from brain activity measured using fMRI. The decoder combines three elements: (1) a structural encoding model that characterizes signals from early visual areas; (2) a semantic encoding model that characterizes signals from higher visual areas; and (3) appropriate priors that incorporate statistical information about the structure and semantics of natural scenes. By combining all these elements the decoder produces reconstructions that accurately reflect the distribution, structure and semantic category of the objects contained in the original image. These results help clarify how distinct representations in different parts of the brain can be combined to provided a coherent reconstruction of the visual world; they also highlight a potentially important role for prior knowledge in visual perception. Our Bayesian decoding framework can be generalized directly to permit reconstruction of other perceptual dimensions, and might facilitate reconstruction of subjective perceptual processes such as visual imagery and dreaming. In the future Bayesian decoding algorithms might form the basis of powerful new brain-reading technologies and brain-computer interfaces.},

  abstract={The world is on the threshold of a remarkable era of computing, in which raw computational power is no longer the limiting factor. The author argues that today's approach to computational science requires revision. This is becoming critical as simulation exerts greater influence on high-consequence decisions with societal impact.},

  abstract={I have recently returned from the US after attending the 2010 IEEE Panel of Editors (PoE) meeting at New Brunswick. On the 18-hour flight back home, I was thinking if the courteous stewardesses could one day be replaced by intelligent robots serving my favorite meal. Imagine asking a robot to prepare a cup of cappuccino and bringing it to you.},

  abstract={There have been many periods in the unfolding of human history when we have asserted that it was possible to catalog all that was known or that could be known. Ignoring the pragmatic reality of trying to catalog an ever-expanding corpus, one must understand that such a task is further complicated by cultural and situational bias: what is important to know at one place and time is not necessary important in another. So it is with our present day; this raises the question, what must a functioning member of society know about computing? The Web extra at http://youtu.be/PjR6GqobTBo is an audio podcast of author Grady Booch reading his On Computing column, in which he discusses how much a functioning member of society today should know about computing.},
