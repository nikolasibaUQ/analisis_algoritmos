  abstract={This is an ongoing research project combines System Dynamics (SD) and participatory modelling to identify variables forming the Russian Federation construction innovation system and to create an initial comprehensive conceptual model supported by stakeholder-based techniques. Quantification of this complex and dynamic construction innovation system is complicated as it includes a range of components such as information, resources, strategies, time and uncertainty. To map and conceptualize the system, system thinking and participatory techniques have been used. Methods employed academic and industry consultation and stakeholder engagement through participatory interviews. In this current paper we present the development of a conceptual model as a causal loop diagram to understand the causes, impacts and pathways leading to greater innovation performance in the Russian Federation construction industry. Moreover, the created model underpins the future development of an operationalized system dynamic model.},

  abstract={Multicore and manycore processors are now ubiquitous, but parallel programming remains as difficult as it was 30-40 years ago. In this talk, I will argue that these problems arise largely from the computation-centric abstractions that we currently use to think about parallelism. In their place, I will propose a novel data-centric foundation for parallel programming called the operator formulation in which algorithms are described in terms of unitary actions on data structures. This data-centric view of parallel algorithms shows that a generalized form of data-parallelism called amorphous data-parallelism is ubiquitous even in complex, irregular graph applications such as mesh generation and partitioning algorithms, graph analytics, and machine learning applications. Binding time considerations provide a unification of parallelization techniques ranging from static parallelization to speculative parallelization. We have built a system called Galois, based on these ideas, for exploiting amorphous data-parallelism on multicores and GPUs. I will present experimental results from our group as well as from other groups that are using the Galois system.},

  pages={180-180},
  abstract={Summary form only given. Business process models have gained significant importance due to their critical role for managing business processes.Still, process models display a wide range of quality problems. For example, literature reports on error rates between 10% and20% in industrial process model collections. Most research in the context of quality issues in process models puts a strongemphasis on the product or outcome of the process modeling act (i.e., the resulting process models), while the process followed for creating process models is only considered to a limited extent. The creation of process models involves the elicitation of requirements from the domain as well as the formalization of these requirements as process models. In this presentation the focus will be on the formalization of process models, which can be considered a process by itself-the process of processmodeling (PPM).In particular, this keynote will discuss how the PPM can be captured and analyzed. For this, it will present a specialized modeling environment, which logs all interactions of the process modeler with the modeling environment, thus, providing the infrastructure to investigate the PPM. The keynote will also shed light on the way how process models are created, present different behavioral patterns that can be observed, and discuss factors that influence the PPM, e.g., modeler-specific factors like domain knowledge or process modeling competence and task-specific factors. In addition, the keynote will provide an outline on how methods like eye movement analysis, think aloud, or the analysis of bio-feedback (e.g., heart rate variability)might enable even deeper insights into the PPM.},

  abstract={In recent times, Big data is modifying the style life of workplaces and thinking by improved performance in knowledge discovering and decision making ever-greater volumes of data are being produced data due to the network of sensors and communication technologies Heterogeneous data is a category of unstructured data with an unknown pace in several ways. Current data analysis techniques are inadequate to handle the huge volumes of data produced, this data difficult to manage, store, handle, interpret, analyze using traditional techniques. Deep learning (DL) is extremely popular among many data scientists and experts thanks to the high precision in speech recognition, image handling, and data analytics. DL has become much more important because it can be used for largescale heterogeneous data. DL has been applied efficiently in several fields and has exceeded most of the traditional techniques, DL algorithmic can study large unclassified data with the ability to select features. This study concentrates on the discussion of a variety of new algorithms that handle this data and DL models that provide greater accuracy for heterogeneous data.},

  title={An embedded system for identifying memory systems and mental image schemas after the Intellectual Style Inventory}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-4},
  abstract={The Intellectual style Inventory (ISI) is a psychometric assessment tool that identifies the preferential style in thinking and in perception for each person. The perception style is concerned with the way our minds usually focus attention regarding sensory inputs from the external environment as well as internal influences. The Integrated model of mind (IMM) is a psychological model that describes how encoding processes take place differently by various memory systems according to perception style preferences. The present work shows a cognitive model for perception in light of the ISI and IMM. It suggests a different encoding sequence performed by the different memory systems that correspond to each of the four perception styles identified by the ISI. The model was then converted into an applicable form; an electronic device (embedded system) that would help to identify the different types of memory systems and the image schema produced by any person according to his score on the ISI. The electronic device could be regarded as the mental finger print identifier for any person and could be perfectly used to manage memory and learning problems and to explore mental abilities and powers. It is made up of three main parts: the Atmega32 microcontroller, LCD AlphaNumeric 20×4 LM044L and Keypad 3×3 and programed using the C-language then simulated using Proteus Design Suite. The device is unique in its function, in the programing strategy and in its relation with the external environment.},

  abstract={Summary form only given. Empirical Modelling (EM) is an approach to computing which includes, but is much broader than, traditional computer science. It occupies a territory where experience is more prominent than abstractions, where state has priority over pre-conceived behaviours and where the agencies behind state change (human or otherwise) are first identified. Extensive research, and teaching of this approach to final year computer science students, over many years under the leadership of Meurig Beynon at the University of Warwick has resulted in a large body of artefacts, environments and publications. They can be found at http://go.warwick.ac.uk/em At the core of EM is an activity we call `making construals'. By a `construal of X' we mean `what we think of X' or `how we make sense of X'. As well as being a personal product of the maker it is at the same time an interactive computer artefact. The development method we adopt allows passage from the mere contemplation of a phenomenon or problem to the crafting of a program-like behaviour that is useful. We shall demonstrate this and explain the advantages of the approach, in at least some domains such as learning, when compared with existing programming paradigms. We have called the approach `human computing' in recognition that its `programs' - in both development and ways of use - have much more of the human qualities of flexibility, and multiple viewpoints, than is usual in a computing environment. It promotes closer collaboration between the human and computer. We shall report on the progress and challenges of the EU Project CONSTRUIT! which is half-way through its three-year duration. With its six European partners CONSTRUIT! seeks to promote the making of construals among teachers and students (at all levels) and to evaluate the effectiveness of this activity for learning across many subjects. See http://go.warwick.ac.uk/em/welcome We hope also to have a practical workshop on making contruals at KST2016 so we look forward to welcoming you to that and seeing what new construals you can help us make!},

  pages={90-94},
  abstract={Technology has an important role in predicting a person's possible risk of chronic disease with the emergence of various kinds of research in the field of medical informatics, especially those related to the four chronic diseases that cause death in Indonesia, such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, and diabetes. Delays in medical treatment due to not predicting the disease can lead to other serious complications in the future. Therefore, doctors must think and work harder to assess patients early with factors influencing chronic disease risk. Many studies have carried out disease prediction focused only on one to two disease predictions. Still, research related to risk prediction for four diseases simultaneously has not been carried out in health and medical services. This study makes a risk prediction model for patients suffering from one or four chronic diseases, which goes through several stages in data mining from medical record data and assessments. We used 29 variables from two combination data sources, calculated using the C4.5 algorithm to predict the patient's risk for the disease. Based on the accuracy test results, the chronic disease prediction model has an accuracy value of 84%.This shows that the resulting model has good decision-making and high accuracy. For further research, other parameters can be used to predict disease, such as dietary habits in a certain period.},

  abstract={With the radically increasing workload on web-based systems, new and innovative methodologies have been developed over years to enhance the performance of web caching. Among them are web cache replacement strategies. Although some classifications and categorizations of these strategies have been proposed, there is not yet a methodological and coherent framework for evaluating and comparing their performances. Current benchmarking tools focus on certain factors at the expense of others. In this paper, we survey the existing efforts and attempts; aiming at a unified evaluation framework that can be used to assess various cache replacement strategies in a wider spectrum of scenarios. Such framework can help developers and users to compare and select various replacement strategies to satisfy their needs and constraints. While discussing various issues related to a multitude of cache replacement strategies, we raise some points that we think are worth to consider in developing such a benchmarking tool.},

  abstract={Due to the widespread use of machine learning models in various third-party libraries in languages, such as the sklearn library, people can quickly learn how to simply use machine learning models to empower the projects. However, in many times, most people simply take the model and apply it, never thinking about its generalization ability in the projects where it belongs to, that is, whether the performance of the model will continue to be excellent in different application scenarios and completely different dataset structures. This work mainly tested the generalization ability of two models. By using a dataset for model training, a brand-new dataset is introduced into the trained model to test its generalization ability. If it is found that the generalization ability is not high, our model is optimized to improve its generalization ability as much as possible. After optimization, their generalization ability (represented by precision improvement here, as explained below) has significantly improved, from 38.56% to 100.00% and from 40.24% to 54.79% respectively.},

  abstract={Point cloud registration is a fundamental but important technique in robotics and computer vision, such as 3D reconstruction, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The classical methods used hand-craft features extracted from each point cloud to estimate the rigid transformation between point clouds with iterative closest points (ICP) or its variants. Recently, deep learning has been widely used in object detection, segmentation and registration, especially the well-known work, PointNet, changed how we think about the representation of point clouds. However, the local information is ignored in PointNet as many works pointed out. In this paper, we advise to use graph attention to aggregate local features and a kind of cross attention method for point cloud registration. Firstly, we use a mini-ConvNet to extract point-wise features for sampled points and their neighbors. Then graph attention is applied to aggregate the local information from neighbor points to center points. We consider that previous works which directly estimate the transformation using the features from two point clouds ignore some relationship between the point clouds. Instead, we propose to explore the relation with a kind of cross attention. We perform extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our method.},

Model query is put forward to solve these problems. Most people chose using OCL as the query language. However, OCL is a textual query language, it isn't powerful enough and always generates very complex query statements even for a simple query. We think that a graphical representation to specify queries on UML models could facilitate the software developers' comprehension on what a query pattern looks like, because of that it is easier to be understood and much more visual. In this paper, we propose a model query method which is queried by drawing examples of the UML model. This query method is based on the graphical representation we presented in this paper.},

  abstract={With the development of corpus linguistics and the improvement of computer performance, the effect of machine translation is getting better and better, and has been widely used. However, the existing automatic machine translation technology is far from being completely practical. As a feasible alternative to automatic machine translation technology, computer-aided translation technology has been greatly developed, and a feasible mode of computer-aided translation is interactive machine translation technology. Therefore, this paper proposes a Human-Computer Interaction Algorithm(HCIA) and designs an English machine translation system(MTS). Based on the research and analysis of the existing interactive machine translation technology, a human-computer interactive English machine translation algorithm model is proposed; The experimental test and analysis of the English MTS proposed in this paper show that the translation system designed in this paper reduces the translator’s thinking time and cognitive burden, does not need to spend too much time and energy on the correct translation recognition, and improves the translation efficiency.},

  abstract={Proposed at the Dartmouth Conference in 1956, the primary objective of artificial intelligence (AI) is to empower machines to think and solve problems akin to humans. Despite the emergence of various large-scale models in recent years, notable progress has been made in the realm of artificial general intelligence (AGI) models. However, machines still encounter challenges in autonomously learning and evolving like humans, and there remains a dearth of a robust mathematical foundation. This paper delves into the autonomous evolutionary process observed in humans and biological entities, asserting that “Needs are the fundamental driving force for organism evolution.” Additionally, the paper introduces corresponding representation algorithms and lays out mathematical theoretical foundations, thereby furnishing a theoretical explanation and a solid mathematical basis for understanding the autonomy of general intelligence models.},

  abstract={Multi-point forming (MPF) is a novel manufacturing technique for three-dimensional sheet metal. It employs two reconfigurable element groups to approximate the continuous upper and lower solid dies. With the technique, rapid fabrication of 3D sheet metal part is realized. In this paper, to investigate the feasibility of the multi-point forming for the tailor-welded blank (TWB), the explicit finite element model on TWB in MPF is established, then spherical surface TWB is selected as an example to simulate weld joint offset defect in the process of MPF, and finally method to suppress generation of defect is proposed. The simulation results show that in MPF for spherical surface part, weld joint removes to thick blank direction in zone of expanding and suspending, but to think blank in zone of blank holder; weld joint offset can be controlled effectively by adopting stepped blank holder and applying proper blank holder force.},

  abstract={With the reform and innovation of higher vocational teaching, the application of VR technology to the construction of virtual simulation training room in tourism management can provide students with new learning experience and continuously cultivate students’ practical operation ability and professional thinking ability. In the virtual simulation system, a large number of data mining technologies are used. The mining steps of the virtual simulation system are mainly divided into two parts. The first is the data mining of the learning process of tourism management knowledge. Its focus is to use statistical algorithms to calculate the actual data, screen and process the relevant knowledge structure, and integrate a series of relevant learning resources. The virtual simulation system can build a digital and realistic working situation for students. It can not only achieve the teaching practice goal, but also quickly improve students’ practical skills and practical ability. This paper mainly analyzes the functions of virtual simulation system in the construction of tourism management training room in higher vocational colleges, such as virtual teaching scene, virtual workbench and virtual intelligent operation, so as to give full play to the role of virtual simulation system in the cultivation of tourism talents.},
