  abstract={Human beings will be living in a ubiquitous world in which all information technology devices are fully networked so that they can offer us desired services at any place and anytime. This shift has hastened the ubiquitous revolution, which has further manifested itself in the new multidisciplinary research area, ubiquitous robotics. It initiates the third generation of robotics following the first generation of the industrial robot and the second generation of the personal robot. A fairy tale introduced Genie, which upon springing from a lamp served Aladdin. The ubiquitous era brings us to the threshold of the realization of this dream, through ubiquitous robotics. Moreover, the robots shall have their own genome in which a specific personality is encoded. This concept leads to the research on genetic robotics. Cyber-physical robot system (CPRS) combines these new concepts of next generation robots for the convergence of computational and physical systems. This talk introduces the recent progress and development of ubiquitous robot, genetic robot and CPRS along with the new classification of robot intelligence. Ubiquitous robot is composed of three forms of robots: software robot, embedded robot and mobile robot to represent an amalgamation of the tripartite personification of entities of perception, thinking and action. Genetic robot has its own genetic codes to represent a specific personality. CPRS conjoins and coordinates the software agents and physical robots including software and hardware resources. Special emphasis in this talk is placed on intelligence technology for the CPRS to realize cognitive intelligence, social intelligence, behavioural intelligence, ambient intelligence, genetic intelligence and swarm intelligence. The intelligence technology shall provide us with seamless, calm, and context-aware services in a networked environment.},

  abstract={In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation for decode-and-forward (DF) relay-assisted SC-FDMA systems. Considering the subcarrier adjacency restriction of SC-FDMA, we present an optimal algorithm which refers to the set partitioning problem. In order to reduce the computational complexity of the optimal resource allocation, we also propose a suboptimal algorithm which is based on the greedy heuristic thinking. Simulation results show that the spectral efficiency of the optimal algorithm is much higher than that of the round robin algorithm. It is also shown that the greedy algorithm, which has much lower complexity, performs quite close to the optimal algorithm.},

  abstract={There is much thinking nowadays about unsanctioned access to personal information. Different strategies have been suggested in survey process, since authors suggest augments with respect to expenditure and process evaluation instance therefore it depends on ciphering the complete information. This article expresses an introduction to cloud computational schema which differentiates information reckoning on significant properties. Most precisely the significant user information would get encrypted with secure encryption algorithm provided with better key size, where in lower significant information may not be ciphered. This methodology helps debasing the process charges and complicatedness of information storage, since there is no compulsion for applying similar refined encryption procedure for all user records. The outcome of introducing suggested schema results in exhibition of amelioration and effectiveness than further open frameworks. There are few of the embellishments chosen and it can be known in the following pages basically to suit the modern demands.},

  abstract={Digital With a growing global population comes a correspondingly higher need for food, making plant disease modernization in agricultural areas a top priority for all nations. Improving productivity is crucial to India’s economy. Consequently, the detection of disease in greeneries plays a key role in the development sector. The accuracy and precision of diagnosing diseases in plants and animals have also been enhanced by the increased use of expertise in modern times. One solution to the problem of classifying different populations is the prospect of grouping in AI techniques. We aim to provide insight into the present state of the illnesses and how to detect them rapidly using computational reasoning. The article suggests thinking about how to use AI techniques to automatically detect plant diseases. This research paper uses the O-RPN (Optimized District Proposition Network) to isolate and control the leaves in a complicated ecosystem. The O-RPN computation incorporates the signs component using Chan-Vese (CV) techniques. The district-based CV calculation yields encouraging results for noise- and weak-edge-free image segmentation. In addition, we compare CNN and SVM using a unique dataset related to plant illnesses.},

  abstract={In literature, we find many examples showing that, contrary to what one might think, multimodal remote sensing analysis might be suboptimal. Given the high computational complexity typically required by multimodal investigation in order to properly extract information from multiple sources, there is a need to assess its actual benefit during image preprocessing. This urgency becomes indeed crucial when targeting transfer learning in remote sensing, as understanding the actual relationship between diverse sensors is fundamental to accurately characterize the considered scenes. In this work, we derive a reliability metric by means of an information theory-based approach. The proposed metric is able to estimate how confident one can be of the considered datasets when characterizing each pixel in the considered region of interest. Experimental results on real datasets show how this quantity can be used to improve the understanding of the scenes, and to enhance multisensor transfer learning.},

  abstract={Whether we think of interaction design as a design tradition aimed at giving form to interaction with and through computational objects or as being about user interface design, it is hard to escape the fact that the user interface to a large extent defines the scene and the form of the interaction. Without adopting a fully deterministic perspective, it is nevertheless a fact that if the user interface is screen-based and graphical and the input modality is mouse-based, then it is likely that the form of that interaction—that is, what the turn-taking looks like and what is demanded by the user—is very similar to other screen-based interfaces with similar input devices. However, the design space for the form of interaction is growing quickly. While command-based interfaces and text-based interfaces defined almost the whole design space in the 1970s, developments since then, including novel ways of bringing sensors, actuators, and smart materials to the user interface, have certainly opened up a broader design space for interaction design.},

  abstract={Depigmentation of the skin is a primary symptom of the vitiligo disorder. By reducing their self-esteem and causing them psychological distress, it lowers patients’ quality of life. The study made use of a number of computational tools, including Cyto Hubba, BioVia Discovery Studio through, Open babel, Drug bank, Avogadro, Auto dock, and Protein-Interaction Ligand profiler. The interaction between 6AAH and (Myristic acid, Heptadecanoic acid, Riboflavin, Propanol, 2,6-Dimethyl-7-octene-2,3,6-trio1) has been examined in this study using Cyto Hubba and PILP clustering interactions, followed by Molecular Docking of Protein and Ligand. Due to its polygenic nature, vitiligo is frequently associated with a number of autoimmune or autoinflammatory disorders, including thyroid disease, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, diabetes mellitus, and pernicious anaemia. Hence, it is conceivable to think about riboflavin as a possible drug for Vitiligo treatment. The findings imply that riboflavin laboratory tests reveal its inhibitory potential on skin depigmentation},

  abstract={We are witnessing a remarkable comeback of computer programming in schools. While computers seem to be accessible everywhere, particularly outside school, where children and youth are connecting to wider networks of other young users, their capacity to wield such devices critically, creatively, and selectively is decidedly less potent. Learning the language of computers introduces students to processes for thinking and solving problems and for engaging creatively and critically with digital media. Using the example of electronic textiles—computational artifacts in which circuits are stitched with conductive thread to connect microcontrollers and control sensors and actuators, I describe how we can broaden access, diversify representation, and deepen learning. More importantly, I illustrate how the introduction of crafting with computing in schools that serve marginalized populations can help diversify who makes and the kinds of artifacts that are being made, how projects can introduce more complex programming concepts and practices, and what kind of tools we can design to support novice programmers in coding and debugging hybrid artifacts.},

A high school student probably gets frustrated by questions like these on the ground that inquiries in arithmetic. The idea of implementing hacking on a smart car should improve student’s interest and motivate them to pursue careers in STEM-related areas. However, if the same example was demonstrated to them using a smart car prototype which was hacked, then there is a good chance they can get attracted towards Technology and Computing. When similar examples, involving the various other topics in their syllabus, are shown, they’ll probably get to see the real-life applications of the topics they study during high school and after that. This paper introduces a new attempt that aims at inclining the interest of high school students towards the courses in the STEM (which have an escalating carrier aspect), improving their computational thinking capability, and making them aware of today’s cybersecurity issues.},

  abstract={In this paper we consider the control problem of ensemble of trajectories for one In recent years, the importance of discrete mathematics has increased dramatically. This is not the name of a branch of mathematics such as number theory, algebra, calculus. This is a separate branch of knowledge, which is called “discrete” (individual). However, there are also processes of continuous mathematics, that is, it becomes a continuous whole. Discrete data can only take integer values, while continuous data can take any value. Discrete mathematics was created several decades ago and is the mathematical language of computer science. Scientists have found that the mathematical disciplines taught in universities are insufficient for learning a programming language. Therefore, they combine additional maths topics into one course, now called discrete mathematics. Discrete mathematics is the foundation of computer science and theoretical computer science. Without learning discrete mathematics, we miss the essence of the logic of computer science. Due to the multiplicity of objects within discrete mathematics, rational clarity in solving programming issues is possible. Every field in computer science is associated with discrete objects, be it databases, network components, computer organization, compilers, network programming, and so on. Essentially, discrete mathematics studies the concepts of counting, mathematical structures, logic, recursion, computational modeling, graph theory and algorithms, and many other disciplines. Evidence, a basic concept in discrete mathematics that includes deductive thinking, simplification, pattern identification, mathematical notation, working within constraints and conditions. This does not mean that a formal course in discrete mathematics is necessary or should be required for programmers. However, many of the concepts discussed in discrete mathematics are applied using this science. In this article, we will look at the basic postulates of discrete mathematics that are necessary to learn the basics of programming.},

Yet, the field of computer science has progressed enormously since the 1970s: multi-core computing, distributed systems, and machine learning are now ubiquitous, and have deep philosophical and practical ramifications for computer science education, including our definitions of what computational thinking is, and for how we design new programming languages, including visual languages.

  abstract={New (interdisciplinary) Computer Science (CS) subjects in K-12 education have been introduced in recent years. Most of them have educational plans derived from CS Frame-works such as the K-12 CS Framework. To some extent the educational plans have the same core topic areas: data and coding (including data compression and data structures), algorithms (in-volving variables and software projects), computers and networks (covering topics like logic tables and data transmission) and information society and data security (consisting of collection and processing of personal data and asymmetric encryption). Various Computer Science assessment tests such as the SCS1, MG-CSCI, PSIv1 and the Fairy Assessment have been developed for different age groups. These tests mostly include computational thinking, programming or topics that could be categorized in the first two core topic areas data and coding and algorithms. Hence, the research desideratum was to develop a test specifically for measuring the four core topic areas. These core topic areas are part of the educational plan of the new interdisciplinary subject IMP (Informatics, Mathematics, Physics) for secondary schools in Germany. The test was piloted with 156 (m = 117, f = 37, o = 2) 10th grade students, approximately aged 16 at the end of the lower secondary level. We used the Item-Response-Theory (IRT) to validate the test. This work in progress paper presents translated items and the psychometric evaluation of the piloted test. The contribution for both researchers and educators in the CS education research field is the set of items of the research-based CS test in the four core topic areas for 10th grade students that includes item sets for the areas computers and networks and information society and data security.},

  abstract={Learning how to program has become a trend in Taiwan even for younger students. IoT is a topic to interest new learners in programming. Given the fact that there are already plenty of tools e.g. Micro:bit and Arduino designed to make IoT programming simple and full of fun, it is usually believed that adopting IoT topics is beneficial for younger students learning how to program. However, younger students’ learning performance in programming courses varies dramatically depending on the tools mentioned above. There are many metrics to predict the academic achievements of young students. Among them, the operation span is an objective one. Operation span mainly assesses one’s working memory capacity. According to the research results, one’s working memory capacity predicts individual high-level cognitive performance. Furthermore, students’ cognitive performance was highly related to their learning performance in programming courses. Nevertheless, the relationship between operation span and the learning performance of programming courses for junior high school students has not been researched yet. In Taiwan, computer programming has already been included as a mandatory subject in the junior high school curriculum for developing students' computational thinking and problem-solving skills. As such, understanding the relationship between OSPAN and programming performance is crucial for effective teaching and learning in this subject. We designed an experiment for an IoT-related after-school club in a junior high school to evaluate the relationship between students’ operation span and learning performance.},

  abstract={We were requested to predict the future specifications of the electronic materials, electronic packages and micro processors for high performance computer systems going as far out as the year 2000 and beyond. These were to be based on the emerging requirements of the end users. Literature and conferences yielded very little quantitative data. As a result, we understood to design and develop a deterministic and macroscopic model based on physics, math, VLSI design, architecture and integration level considerations. The resulting model transcended the electronic world from system performance to microprocessor description to packaging specifications and required material's specifications. Based on this model, it is likely, that the world will see an integration of 100 million transistors on a single chip providing clock frequencies approaching 213 MHz and CPU power near about 238 MIPS. Transportation is a major business for Alcoa. We have used our model to examine what architectural directions the Mobile 2000 would take for satisfying its command and control, navigational, entertainment, communication, engine, transmission and body/cockpit control and management systems. A scenario is developed based on the current and emerging requirements for the above functions leading to the automobile of the year 2000. This is then translated to yield control and system requirements which then are converted to the total computational requirements. The requirements are used to define the future system specifications based on our model's predictions. Alternative architectures are then presented. Cautions and caveats are discussed based on our experience on several large scale Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) networks', design development and implementation. It is imperative to bring the large scale systems thinking to Mobile 2000's automation and support systems so that the classical pitfalls of cost, performance, lack of planning, ad hoc and proliferation of incompatible systems does not take place in this exciting arena.},

  abstract={Constraint-based mining has been proven to be extremely useful. It has been applied not only to many pattern discovery settings (e.g., for sequential pattern mining) but also, recently, on classification and clustering tasks (see, e.g., ). It appears as a key technology for an inductive database perspective on knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), and constraint-based mining is indeed an answer to important data mining issues (e.g., for supporting a priori relevancy and subjective interestingness but also to achieve computational feasibility). However, few authors study the nature of constraints and their semantics. Considering several examples of non trivial KDD processes, we discuss the Hows, Whys, and Whens of constraints in a broader context than. Our thesis is that most of the typical data mining methods are constraint-based techniques and that it is worth studying and designing them as such. In many cases, we exploit constraints that are not really explicit (e.g., the objective function optimization of a clustering for a given similarity measure) and/or constraints whose operational semantics are relaxed w.r.t. their declarative counterparts (e.g., the optimization constraint is not enforced because of some local optimization heuristics). We think that is important to explicit every primitive constraint and the operators that combine them because this constitutes the declarative semantics of the constraints and thus the mining queries. Then, a well-studied challenge is to design some operational semantics like correct and complete solvers and/or relaxation schemes for more or less complex constraints. Designing complete solvers has been extensively studied in useful but yet limited settings (see, e.g., the algorithms for exploiting combinations of monotonic and anti-monotonic primitives). It is however clear that many relevant constraints lack from such nice properties. On another hand, understanding constraint relaxation strategies remains fairly open, certainly because of its intrinsically heuristic nature. Interestingly, the recent approaches that suggest global pattern or model construction based on local patterns enable to revisit the relaxation issue thanks to constraint back propagation possibilities. This can be discussed within a case study on constrained co-clustering.},

  abstract={Educational Robotics provides a dynamic and effective platform for fostering diverse skills and competencies. In this context, this paper explores creating and implementing a robotics club in a high school. The proposed methodology emphasizes the educational tripod: teaching, research, and extension. Therefore, the paper outlines the club’s conception, the sources of inspiration, and the achieved outcomes within the school and local community. It also highlights the activities and small projects developed by the students and the active participation of the club members in the Brazilian National Robotics Olympics. Furthermore, through student reports and an internal survey, the paper emphasizes the remarkable development of desired competencies, including creativity, teamwork, problem-solving, and computational thinking.},

  abstract={This paper presents a complementary, alternative teaching and learning methodology based on the use of the finite element method to illustrate mathematical models and to explore their (numerical) solutions in the context of vector calculus properties understanding. This methodology is illustrated via a set of examples focused on specific engineering problems, but its scope can also be widened to other scientific areas. The examples presented on this paper allow concluding that this approach may be an interesting way to re-think and complement the perspective usually considered in the transmission of mathematical concepts. The use of a freeware finite element method computational package, FreeFEM++ may also be an important issue to stimulate the dissemination of this phenomena modelling and comprehension approach.},

  abstract={Writing a book about artificial general intelligence in 2023 means chasing a moving target. I started working on this book before ChatGPT was released, quickly gained tens of millions of users, and reinvigorated the AGI debate. As I am finalizing this book in October 2023, there is intense discussion among both technologists and politicians about AI regulation. By the time you read this, much will have happened in terms of both technology and policy. But my descriptions of how the underlying computational methods work will still be true, and I think the various points I make throughout the book about both natural and artificial intelligence will still apply.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a method to grade programming exam questions automatically. Our motivation is that there are no robust and scalable automatic methods for the analysis of computational thinking from source code programmed by elementary-level students. The approach to this problem supports the improvement of PC development in primary and secondary school students. The validation of the method is performed through the assessment of the answers of primary school students to programming exercises using a programming language called LIE++. The method assesses student answers using several techniques such as the analysis of programming structures, code clones and the execution of code based on input and output values defined during the specification of the exercises. The use of these techniques provides specific scores to obtain a grade of the student’s answer. The source code analysis and scoring of exercise answers is carried out using high-performance computing for improving system response time. This research contributes a scalable method for the automatic evaluation of exams, which we expect to support the development of PC.},
