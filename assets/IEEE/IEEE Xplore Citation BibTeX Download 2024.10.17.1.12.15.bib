  abstract={Now-a-days information security over unsecured communication channel is one of the most challenging issues. Cryptography and steganography, a sub-discipline of information hiding, are two distinct popular security offering techniques. To get the combined chemistry from these techniques, today's real-time security systems include both cryptography and steganography in their working principle. To cope up with those systems, we have proposed a format-based pure text steganography algorithm including a private key cryptography providing a higher level of security. The cover text has been made as ordinary as possible. After successful embedding of the secret message into the cover text, the stego-text also looks like an ordinary text because only an alphanumeric puzzle is added at the end of the cover text to make up the stego-text. This final stego-text is sent to the receiver through the unsecured communication channel. Instead of correct recipient, if any third party or cracker or hacker obtains the stego-text, they may think that it is an ordinary text to teach English to the kids since we made it like that or if they try to extract the original message, it requires a huge amount of computational time. The proposed algorithm supersedes various text steganographic techniques through combining both cryptography and steganography.},

  abstract={The Sprego (Spreadsheet Lego) programming method facilitates the use of different educational tools and environments to provide better understanding of spreadsheet programming while developing computational thinking and algorithmic skills. With virtual reality technologies gaining attention and popularity, our goal was to investigate and create a virtual workspace in which the students can find all the information and resources they need while learning spreadsheet programming, computer problem solving, and understanding, building algorithms. Following on this principle, we developed a 3D virtual collaboration space to provide students with one interface featuring the information and resources required to practice the Sprego method outside of and during classes. We have collected, refined, and structured the available sources and developed detailed tasks with explanations for students in the form of online documents. Our goal was to provide an all-in-one environment for the Sprego method to learn, explore, and practice all its aspects without leaving the 3D space. For our work, we examined different applications that provide virtual 3D spaces with educational support in mind. Our choice was the MaxWhere Seminar system, based on its innovative and effective approach in the field.},

  abstract={Data entry has been a hectic job since the era of data accumulation started. Apparently, that is why there is a full-fledged career in data entry. Data entry method varies with requirements. Early days of computers relied on punch cards and gradually keyboards and mouse came into picture which we still use. Touchscreens didn't take much time to replace the physical keyboard inputs and now as the result of human intelligence and innovation, the era of the optical input is here. Where the user does not even have to take the pain of thinking about entering data but can simply use an optical reader or scanner to input data. Using the computational power the individual elements like text, images, and special characters can be distinguished. OCR-Optical Character Recognizer does the work. OCR works similar to humans when it comes to character recognition as it maintains a database of characters and compares all the scanned elements with the database which makes it really simple to understand. This paper explains the working of an OCR in its different stages. That study helps in finding the various drawbacks of the conventional system. The paper also tells about how those shortcomings can be eliminated and how a better OCR that is future ready can be achieved.},

  year={2018},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-4},
  abstract={Crumble is an easy-to-use programmable controller. Its programming interface uses a block programming language that makes it easy for children above 10 to use. In addition, the hardware elements associated with Crumble are very intuitive and easy to connect. For this reason, educational robotics can be easily implemented thanks to the card connectors. The motors and servos can be managed by Crumble. Different sensors such as the ultrasonic distance sensor, infrared distance sensor and line sensor can also be connected. In addition, Crumble can handle up to 32 RGB (Red, Green and Blue) LEDs (Light Emitter Diodes) independently and with 24-bit color resolution. Robotics and computational thinking are ideal tools for developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. Today, robotics training tools are raised with the aim of promoting innovation and motivation of students during the learning process. Robots are becoming more and more common in our daily lives; therefore, it is important to integrate robots into all levels of our society. This document presents a workshop that focuses on two main objectives. The first is to make an event to promote Crumble locally. On the other hand, the aim of this event is to present a robotic teaching tool so that people can take their first steps in the world of robotics. This workshop is aimed at those children and adults who want to discover the possibilities that Crumble brings in the introduction to robotics. An introduction to Crumble in the context of educational robotics is developed throughout this workshop.},

  abstract={Kohonen's self organizing maps (SOM) is a kind of neural network that the algorithm learns the feature of input data thorough unsupervised and competitive neighborhood learning. SOM is mapped from a high dimensional space onto a two dimensional space, so it can visualize the high-dimensional information to the map. In the SOM's learning algorithm, there are many factors to aggravate the computational load and a competition to be declared the winner. We think it is a major factor at the beginning of learning process that SOM's map is changing dynamically and widely and the learning dynamics depends on the distance of each input data. Thus we suppose that, by adjusting the data order, the competition must be reduced and the learning convergence must become faster. In this paper, we discuss the "efficient learning by data order adjustment", and compare it with the conventional method. We achieved a maximum 9% improvement.},

  abstract={ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) is an agreement from ASEAN countries to form a free trade area which is used to increase the economic competitiveness in ASEAN regional area. Some governmental agencies and national companies have to prepare to face AFTA and build their strategies to survive from trade area by understanding what Indonesian people think about that. In this paper we present a system to analyze the opinion of Indonesian people about AFTA and extract a useful information of the sentiment analysis from their opinion. Our system consists of 5 computational steps: (1) Data Acquisition, (2) Text Mining, (3) Sentiment Analysis Engine, (4) Temporal Projection Engine, and (5) Context Processing Unit. We apply a new approach to analyze opinions about AFTA by opinion mining based on temporal sentiment analysis. This approach extracts and process textual data automatically to obtain sentiment information in the opinion sentences. The results show effectiveness of the simple approach for gaining the sentiment information from people's opinions and some stakeholders and students who are concerned in AFTA have assessed this solution.},

  abstract={A finite-element solver for electrical defibrillation analysis has been developed on a massively parallel computer, Thinking Machines Corporation's Connection Machine 2 (CM-2), which allows a high degree of parallelism and the solution of large problems. The solver uses a nodal assembly technique where each node in the finite-element grid is mapped to a virtual processor in the computer. Using this solver, potential and current density distributions during transthoracic defibrillation have been calculated for different anatomic models, including a realistic 3-D finite-element model constructed from a series of cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images of a mongrel dog. Numerical results obtained with this model are presented together with computational performance data for the algorithm.<>},

  abstract={Nowadays, there are more cars used on the road. Traffic congestion problems can cause the economy and the environment both directly and indirectly problems, also part of the problem of air pollution. The traffic light management system in the current situation has used a fixed waiting time, which inability to be flexible according to the traffic at different times such as in rush hour and other. It is not efficient enough to manage traffic with fixed waiting time. The organizers came up with the idea of developing an intelligent traffic light system with flexibility according to the number of cars in real-time by reducing waiting time. The paper was designed and developed by implementing the intelligent traffic light system using image processing technology to process the appropriate waiting time from each image frame. Lazarus and OpenGL were used to program based on Pascal language. The software has been developed for receiving traffic video at the intersection to process car image segmentation of each frame and to calculate the distance of the length of the car in each route in addition. It is also possible to calculate the appropriate time for green-light and red-light duration and corresponding to the length of the waiting vehicles in each route at the intersection. This investigated software can be used to reduce the waiting time at the traffic light intersection by 45.35%. In addition, the intelligent traffic light system is also a social development towards a smart city. The project has created the learning environment and computational thinking for society through the process of STEM Education with using IoT and Artificial Intelligence.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={In this work in progress paper we present an example of innovative practice in organizing informal STEM education workshops with young children. The workshops were divided into two learning scenarios, unplugged programming and hands-on robot play. Unplugged programming encourages understanding of the core concepts of programming such as algorithms and computational thinking rather than focusing on the programming language. In the second learning scenario, pupils were introduced to two educational robots used as a learning tool - Thymio and Codey Rocky. The aim of the second activity was linking the programming concept to a real-world scenario. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected using pre- and post- questionnaires. The pre-questionnaires contained questions about the pupils' background knowledge, i.e. basic concepts of programming and robotics. The post-questionnaires were designed to evaluate the workshops impact on the pupils' perception of these observed concepts and their overall satisfaction with the workshops. Combining unplugged activities with robots helps bridging the gap between imagination and reality, therefore improving learning.},

  abstract={We present a block-based language for specifying feedback to novice learners about the programs they are constructing in a block-based programming language. In addition to feedback based on run-time and output checking, we are particularly interested in immediate feedback: corrective guidance given as the program is being constructed. Immediate feedback is a natural extension of the block-based language philosophy. Block-based languages prevent by design certain types of mistakes in all cases. Immediate feedback guides against, without fully preventing, problem-specific mistakes (i.e., constructions that are erroneous in only some cases). A feedback specification contains a block pattern and a set of actions that can be taken whenever the corresponding pattern is present or absent in the student's block program for a given problem. The paper illustrates the language through several examples derived from misconceptions found in the block-based programs of students taking a university-level Computational Thinking class. The feasibility of the proposed approach is shown by the translation of a specification using an evolving programmatic interface in BlockPy, a dual block/text programming environment for a subset of Python.},

  abstract={In computer vision and increasingly, in rendering and image processing, it is useful to filter images with continuous rotated and scaled families of filters. For practical implementations, one can think of using a discrete family of filters, and then to interpolate from their outputs to produce the desired filtered version of the image. We propose a multirate implementation of deformable kernels, capable to further reduce the computational weight. The "basis" filters are applied to the different levels of a pyramidal decomposition. The new system is not shift-invariant-it suffers from "aliasing". We introduce a new quadratic error criterion which keeps into account the inherent system aliasing. By using hypermatrix and Kronecker algebra, we are able to cast the global optimization task into a multilinear problem. An iterative procedure ("pseudo-SVD") is used to minimize the overall quadratic approximation error.},

The goal of the program is to advance both knowledge and practice in creating inclusive, responsive computer science/computational thinking programs for all K-12 youth. RPPs represent an approach to research that, by design, is both more equitable and more ethical because it leverages community stakeholder experiences and perspectives to inform research questions, methods, and meaning-making. RPPs are thus potentially powerful tools for equity-oriented initiatives such as CS for All. Beginning in December 2016, the Research + Practice Collaboratory, an NSF-funded initiative based at the University of Washington, has led ten RPP development workshops for CS for All, collectively serving over 700 members of the community. At these workshops we have collected data about how the community sees itself benefiting from the adoption of RPP approaches to the work. In this experience paper we describe what we have learned about the field's interests with respect to adopting RPP approaches to the work.},

  abstract={A new sliding controller is proposed. Second order linear system sliding curves eliminate the reaching phase and consequently and associated problems of load sensitivity and high demanded torque. Moreover, the chattering usually present in the sliding phase also disappears with the new control law. Simulation results show a negligible coupling between axes, thus enabling an easier and more efficient controller adjustment. It is also shown that the controller parameter set can be easily adjusted, and there is a large set of possible quasi-optimal values. This is of utmost importance, when one thinks of the industrial applications of this type of algorithms. Experiments were developed based on the position control problem. Nevertheless, generalization to the trajectory tracking problem is trivial. In either case the controller computational requirements are low, thus well adapted to today's microprocessor based digital control technology.<>},

The "Computing" course is a ten-week course that includes material on the following: the "computing perspective" (the algorithmic model as a way of thinking); foundational concepts underlying program design and implementation, including: algorithmic methods, static and dynamic data structures, and design using abstraction; fundamental notions of algorithm analysis and computability; and use of application tools such as e-mail, Web browsers, word processors, spreadsheets, databases, and equation solvers. Building on this foundational pre-programming material, students in the "Programming" course are able to learn rapidly the skills in program design, implementation, and debugging necessary to solve computational problems in a high-level programming language. We emphasize effective use of abstraction and the acquisition of software development skills that are language independent. Our experience with these courses has convinced us that it is possible to introduce the conceptual foundations of computer science to beginning students in a way that both engages them and gives them a basis for learning advanced ways to solve problems using computing, either via programming or through use of modern, highly-programmable commercial applications.},

There are several reasons for this, but opinions point to the student's inability to solve problems, difficulties in logical reasoning and lack of critical attitude. The Portuguese Ministry of Education proposed in 2015/2016, in extracurricular period, the Getting Started with Programming challenging in primary School activities, with the intention of promoting computational thinking competences in students. Two schools from Coimbra city opted to use Scratch software for the implementation of this project aiming to promote school success in subjects already mentioned. The project, based on the academic curriculum of 4th grade, intends to link the theoretical knowledge with the practical knowledge, promoting the characteristic values of the city of Coimbra. This project implementation resulted in different applications (computer games) created by students, covering the contents of the mentioned subjects, but concretizing these knowledge with the socio-cultural and environmental realities of the city of Coimbra. The following study demonstrates the results obtained in 5 classes in 2015-2016 and six classes in 2016-2017, according to student satisfaction and project evaluation.},

  abstract={Given a capable human being and a computer, it is possible to make an approximation to the solution of a nonlinear differential equation. However, under the (usually correct) assumption that the equation is analytically intractable, the result of the computation is not the exact solution; indeed it may be so far from the exact solution as to be completely useless. We are interested in the relationship between the effort expended by the human and the computer, and the duality of the computed approximation to a partial or ordinary differential equation. To be specific, we would like to think in terms of a cost-benefit analysis. The cost of the computation is a combination of the human effort and computer resources used to obtain the approximation. The benefit includes, of course, the computed approximation, but it also includes an estimate of the quality of the approximation, that is, an error estimate. It is our opinion that in computational science, as with the experimental sciences, results should always be presented with some estimate of their accuracy. In addition, however, there is another facet to error estimation: one cannot even attempt a cost-benefit analysis or efficiency comparison of methods without an error estimate to evaluate the results.},

  abstract={One of the grand challenges of the future generation intelligent systems is how to build a robot which can think in a way similar to human beings. In this case, cognitive robotics attempts to embed cognitive abilities of the natural intelligence, specially the human brain, in robotics applications. To provide the context of such an objective, an interdisciplinary approach which is a merger of different fields of study like artificial intelligence, cognitive informatics, psychoanalysis, and neuroscience, should be adopted. In this paper, to design the behavioral mechanism of adventurous robots, the Motivation/Attitude-Driven Behavior (MADB) model, which is a plausible computational model of human behavior with the purpose of simulating robots equipped with basic humanoid emotions, is exploited. As a result, the proposed model has provided adventurous robots with the capability of showing emotional behaviors. Finally, adventurous robots and conventional ones are separately implemented in a virtual ecosystem and their effort for survival is compared. Consequently, the simulation results show that adventurous robots have a greater chance to survive in the simulated environment.},

  abstract={In recent years, in all contexts of our lives, we have seen a real explosion of data. From a research standpoint, data processing needs have increasingly become common in an ever growing number of applications, with potential benefits not only in our work but also in our lives: the need not just to acquire, store and perform modest operational tasks but also to analyze and properly interpret data. In this talk, we consider some of the hottest and most demanding scenarios in our daily lives, which include: medical analytics to improve the quality of life of the elderly and reduce health care expenses; social network analytics for enhancing cultural heritage dissemination; exploration of work datafication potential in improving the management of human resources (HRM); game analytics to foster Computational Thinking in education. We describe the recent findings we have obtained in our research in these contexts using the latest technology for data analytics, including interpretable machine learning, and discuss the consequences and directions for the future.},

  abstract={According to the Code.org there are currently 528,174 open computing jobs in U.S. and only 49,291 computer science students graduated into the workforce, last year. In order to try to reverse this scenario, several countries are working on a way to include computer science concepts, like computational thinking, in their curriculums for K-12 education. In addition, many studies and researches are being done related to practices and tools that can be applied in order to retain students that applied for computer science courses. In order to contribute to these initiatives, this paper presents CODEX, an interactive and ludic learning object, that aims to help students that do not need to have a background in programming to learn one of the most important structure in a programming language, the loop. CODEX was designed to be used both in class and in extra-class activity.},

  abstract={Multi-agent system is one of the most popular research interests in robotics nowadays. How would collections of simple robots aid us in human endeavours? Let us think about an ant colony. Ants have little capability, but when many of them are working together, they can do incredible tasks. By examining the major control architectures available in robotics area, decentralized-based reactive control architecture gives the tools required. Priority-based scheme is used in arbitration level to select which behaviour to run. It does not need to gather all information from various sensors to plan its action like deliberative control, which is also known as sensors fusion that clearly required a lot of computational time. Besides that, the mapping that the deliberate control architecture produces might not be valid at the time when changes occur between the time it gathers the information and the time it plans its actions. Instead, intelligence will arise when these simple agents work together to perform some complex task cooperatively. Our multi-agent system consists of three mobile robots that are required to transfer a large object through a restricted area. We are using a leader follower strategy to accomplish this task. Intelligence in multi-agent system in our context is that any agents have a possibility to be a leader or a follower depending on current situation of the environment. This means that all agents are homogeneously equal in hardware and software. By having this capability, it will ensure the burden of the programming task will be decreased because there will be only one program needed for the whole system. In this paper, decentralized reactive control architecture is used to develop an intelligent multi-agent cooperative strategy to perform complex task like carrying a load and navigation.},
