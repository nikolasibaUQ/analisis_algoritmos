  abstract={This paper scrutinizes the structure of jump-controlled LFSRs for resistance against generalized correlation attack based upon Constrained Levenshtein Distance(CLD) measure. It proves that for a given number of cipher text bits, CLD computation is independent of Jump index. However, based upon the inherent relation between the jump index and deletion rate, it is argued that structures utilizing primitive polynomials with large values of jump indices are relatively safer against generalized correlation attack when compared with their counterparts. The paper also presents a novel recursive algorithm for efficient computation of CLD for jump controlled structures and another algorithm to defeat the complexity induced due to high deletion rates.},

  abstract={Open-source research software plays a central role in accelerating advances in science and engineering. Its increasing significance, however, incentivizes malicious actors to attack that software and compromise the systems on which it runs, undermining the free and open exchange of trustworthy research codes. In the world of conventional software development, there has been a shift towards integrating security as early as possible in the development process to guard against malicious activity. Given the potential risks at hand, developers of research software must consider how to do the same across the research software lifecycle. This editorial argues for the need to unite diverse forms of expertise in scientific computing and software security to address these challenges and outlines a roadmap for future work in this space.},

  abstract={The various methods for remote learning has been there in the global education system even from the mid of 90’s. The technology aided online teaching learning process has come to its natural evolution and pace these years. Various technologies like augmented reality, virtual reality, machine learning etc has made the system very effective and efficient. The technology driven education, be it simple or complex has its own relevance in dealing with certain subjects. By this, subjects can be made interesting,comprehensive and it develops students creativity and imagination. The technology driven education system is not still common because of the mind set of the people, poor connectivity, inadequate technology upgradation in schools. Even though after the advent of the pandemic the use of online tools for education has increased, the suitability of each technology for different age groups is still a matter of concern. Cascading different methods, customizing the technology based on the subject taught is of prime importance. The paper research on various technologies involved in online teaching learning process and try to know the suitability of each technology in different contexts.},

  abstract={This paper proposed an intelligent path-following control strategy that combines the line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law and Q-learning (QL) for an underactuated unmanned surface vehicle (USV) with unknown model parameters. The improved LOS achieves satisfactory path-following results for USVs with uncertain models, where the embedded QL method learns the vehicle model by the self-regulation of uncertain parameters to accomplish the robustness and adaptation for the path-following. Simulation results in tracking a straight line and a circular path are demonstrated respectively. The environmental effect of wave disturbances is also analyzed, which verifies the effectiveness of the improved LOS method based on QL.},

  pages={484-487},
  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) based learning system is a significant tool for developing the cognitive ability and problem-solving skill both in real life and education. This research investigates the reduction of cognitive load in CT based learning system than non-computational (NCT) learning way more accurately after doing a particular task within a scheduled training. But for the measurement of the cognitive load instantly no platform is used before. To overcome this problem the ultimate goal of this paper is to construct a MATLAB GUI for immediately measurement of electroencephalography (EEG) based cognitive load individually. To measure the amount of cognitive load EEG signal was acquired from the two-class participants during the strategically question task and resting state. Preprocessing steps along with power spectral density were extracted to calculate the theta/beta ratio which strongly correlates with cognitive load. By seeing the fluctuation curve of theta beta ratio students learning ability can be determined. All these steps would be possible with the help of MATLAB GUI immediately by pushing button.},

  pages={1-19},
  abstract={A user's location is a sensitive data and can reveal private information about the user's health, habit and preferences. Due to privacy concerns, people may hesitate to share their locations and prohibit the growth of location-based services and analysis. The problem of protecting location privacy has been extensively studied in the literature. Sharing location data in sequence enable adversaries to apply privacy attacks by exploiting spatio-temporal constraints in road networks. In this paper, we identify a novel privacy attack that existing solutions cannot overcome for not considering upcoming sensitive locations in advance. We develop a technique to precompute the warning zone, i.e. the refined area where the disclosure of a user's actual location may enable adversaries to identify the user's sensitive locations in the future. Warning zones also enable users to reduce the frequency of not sharing locations for privacy reasons, and thereby improve the accuracy and utility of shared locations while guaranteeing the required level of location privacy of a user. Experiments using real datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art technique in terms of privacy, data utility and computational overhead.},

  abstract={Mathematics is one of the most difficult courses to study for engineering students. In addition, effective communication, teamwork, and problem solving are important skills for graduate engineers in their professional work. This study proposes Creative Problem Solving as a framework to improve the way engineering students learn mathematics and support their critical problem solving, communication, and team working skills. The main goal of this paper is to illustrate the importance of using creative problem solving skills through blended learning environment as seen from an Engineering Mathematics students' perspective. First year undergraduate students participated in an experimental group where instruction was provided in a blended learning format using a creative problem solving approach. The lecturer then used face-to-face instruction on the same subject to a control group. Results indicate that from the perspective of the students in the experimental group, the ability to utilize creative problem solving skills is the most important skill set when learning Engineering Mathematics.},

This research demonstrates fast and viable ways to build such models in operational environments.

We describe how we used this approach as part of a scenario-driven modeling effort. We demonstrate the strength of moving from data to models and the advantages of data-driven simulation, which allow for iterative refinement.

  abstract={The information society is a reality nowadays, and computational thinking has become a relevant competence for everybody, regardless of age, social status, and primary activity. Information society is everywhere in contemporary life, and algorithmic thinking represents a significant competency for individuals, irrespective of their educational background and social condition. Developing and applying programming competencies represents a high-value know-how ability. Block-based coding and design tools like Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino allow people to successfully build programming competencies in online environments regardless of age and social status. This article presents empirical evidence of the positive impact of the block-based programming language Scratch and the design tool TikerCAD Arduino in practical workshops to develop computational thinking with school children, school teachers, and university students. The results permit finding patterns, and almost transversal teaching approaches to build an elementary computational thinking competency applying Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino, with a block-based approach in both tools and textual programming in the second one. The motivation and wishes of learning in all participants were hegemonic. Those results demonstrate the positive impact of Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino on developing computational thinking competencies without restrictions. This work shows the application of Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino in non-WEIRD contexts and, during the pandemic time, demonstrates the relevance of online education. The results show that developing programming competencies with Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino motivated students’ autonomy and motivation for learning regardless of their education level and status. Those results encourage us to continue using Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino to develop programming competencies without considering age and education level.},

  abstract={The term "Modern Art Teaching and Evaluation Model" describes the systematic incorporation of creative practices, methods, and experiences into traditional academic curricula in order to improve student achievement across the curriculum. The design thinking process and visual thinking tactics are two of the most popular methods. blockchain technology is up to the task of solving problems plaguing the higher education system and society as a whole. The blockchain's many benefits include less expensive transactions due to less time spent checking, controlling, and verifying data, as well as the presence of decentralized open data and the absence of forgeries and unsafe storing of information. The purpose of this study is to analyze the potential benefits and drawbacks of using blockchain technology in education, as well as the effects that this technology may have on the future of this sector. Although its rapid development, blockchain (BC) has not yet been widely included into the education of contemporary art. The purpose of this paper is to develop strategies for integrating BC into 21st-century art instruction. After examining how BC technologies are currently being utilized within the realm of contemporary art education, the writers assessed the issues associated with their utilization. As a result, three approaches to promoting BC facets of contemporary art learning were developed: bolstering the malleability of BC-based modern art learning, strengthening the innovative three education of art learning, and enhancing the recent art background and ambience of BC-based modern art learning. In this research, modern art education to be provided via a blockchain-based system (BC-MAT) is discussed to improve the student performance. Concurrently, a productivity analysis strategy using analytical hierarchical processing (AHP) and grey grouping was developed to assess BC's impact on today's art classrooms. The BC-MAT has numerous applications and can be used to determine how BC has affected modern art education. The simulation results demonstrate the system's superior performance in precision, accuracy, efficiency, productivity, learning score, and student performance score.},

  abstract={Although, Unified Modeling Language (UML) has become a de-facto standard for design and specification of object oriented systems but its structures being semi-formal in nature have various disadvantages. The UML diagrams lack with defining semantics of the functionality of a system to be developed. Automata theory and formal methods are proved powerful at requirement specification, modeling, design and test case generation. To address and realize the benefits of liking UML, automata and formal methods, our project on "formalization of UML diagrams" is in progress. This paper is continuation of the same project in which behavior diagrams namely use case, activity and state diagrams are selected for critical analysis and possible improvements. Advantages, disadvantages and limitations of the diagrams are addressed. Finally, a treatment is suggested to link UML diagrams with nondeterministic and parallel finite automata to enhance modeling power of UML for facilitating the software development procedures.},

  year={2023},
  volume={15},
  number={3},
  pages={1170-1182},
  abstract={From the philosophical point of view, granular computing (GrC) attempts to abstract and formalize the way of human cognition to extract a structured thinking mode. Fuzzy Petri nets (FPNs) have a strong formal description and fuzzy reasoning abilities, which align with human cognitive thinking. However, the traditional FPNs are challenging to describe the following problems: formally expressing the transformation relations between information granules and information granule levels, and then carrying out formal reasoning and decision making based on cognitive thinking mode. This article introduces the qualitative mapping and the qualitative criterion transformation method to explore this problem. First, the problem of attribute information granulation is discussed by using the equivalence relation of attributes. Second, qualitative mapping is used to express the transformation relationship between information granules. The transformation relationship between attribute information granule levels is realized by qualitative criterion transformation, and the basic algebraic structure of attribute information granules is given. The basic network elements of FPNs can formally describe the relationships between these information granules. Finally, a cognitive reasoning and decision-making model for the formal description of attribute information granules based on the new FPN is constructed, and the proposed case study verifies the feasibility of the proposed method.},

  pages={52-62},
  abstract={This article constitutes an effort to gain insights into the nature of creativity and its mechanisms leading to creative solutions to problems. This article claims that reflection constitutes the underlying mechanism, serving as a catalyst for creativity. A total of five experiments is presented, incurred in industrial and academic research environments and pedagogical settings, that demonstrate the occurrence of creativity, deliberately triggered by reflection. The key contribution of this article is that, although the exact definition of creativity continues to elude us, two mechanisms have been uncovered that are potentially useful in triggering creativity, at will, in ordinary scientific and engineering personnel to achieve quantum leaps in our knowledge and achievement. Reflection plays a key, catalytic role in both of these mechanisms and also appears to underlie the inner workings of Nature.},

  abstract={Can computers have intuition and insights, and be creative? Neurocognitive models inspired by the putative processes in the brain show that these mysterious features are a consequence of information processing in complex networks. Intuition is manifested in categorization based on evaluation of similarity, when decision borders are too complex to be reduced to logical rules. It is also manifested in heuristic reasoning based on partial observations, where network activity selects only those paths that may lead to solution, excluding all bad moves. Insight results from reasoning at the higher, non-verbal level of abstraction that comes from involvement of the right hemisphere networks forming large "linguistic receptive fields." Three factors are essential for creativity in invention of novel words: knowledge of word morphology captured in network connections, imagination constrained by this knowledge, and filtering of results that selects the most interesting novel words. These principles have been implemented using a simple correlation-based algorithm for auto-associative memory. Results are surprisingly similar to those created by humans.},

  abstract={Accelerated by the Do-It-Yourself mindset of the Web 2.0 culture, end-user programming-programming by end users with limited or even no formal programming background-is growing rapidly. Especially in educational settings, children are exposed to computational thinking by making games, building scientific simulations and creating stories. Early educational programming languages such as Logo have made programming substantially more accessible to end-users. More recent approaches include visual programming with a drag-and-drop style of programming that makes it nearly impossible to compose syntactically incorrect programs. However, as the syntactic challenges of end-user programming are gradually fading into the past, the new frontier of semantic programming support emerges. This demonstration introduces Conversational Programming, a system to make programming more conversational. A conversational programming agent runs programs one step into the future in order to help end-users visualize discrepancies between the programs they intended to write and their actual programming results.},

  abstract={In the Northern Appalachian region around Pittsburgh, PA, many high schools do not have computer science courses, so students are not introduced to this critical subject that is needed for most technical career paths. Our unique strategy is to invite current high school science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) teachers, in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio and Maryland, to participate in 3 summer workshops showing how to incorporate computing concepts into existing STEM courses. By working with teachers on how to assimilate programming and computational thinking into their classrooms we will effectively reach a large population of students in areas where computer science classes are not available. In this paper, we outline the current state of the project and some of the data we have collected. Future goals for this project include performing a rigorous evaluation of teacher impact and developing the workshop materials for wider dissemination.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) has been integrated into K-12 curricula globally, and coding has been the main vehicle in CT education. While great effort has been made in exploring cognitive effect of coding, limited has been done in attitudinal aspects. To bridge this gap, this study validated the existing Elementary Student Coding Attitudes Survey (ESCAS) in Chinese context and use the scale to explore how students perceived coding. Also, the association between coding attitude and CT performance was investigated. A total of 217 elementary students were involved. Psychometric qualities of ESCAS (Chinese) were examined, and the effect of coding attitudes on CT cognitive performance was analyzed with linear regression. Results showed that ESCAS (Chinese) was a valid and reliable attitudinal scale, and coding interest could predict CT performance. Future directions for the study were discussed.},
