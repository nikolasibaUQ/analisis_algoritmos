  title={MASD: A Multimodal Assembly Skill Decoding System for Robot Programming by Demonstration}, 
  year={2018},
  volume={15},
  number={4},
  pages={1722-1734},
  abstract={Programming by demonstration (PBD) transforms the robot programming from the code level to automated interface between robot and human, promoting the flexibility of robotized automation. In this paper, we focus on programming the industrial robot for assembly tasks by parsing the human demonstration into a series of assembly skills and compiling the skill to the robot executables. To achieve this goal, an identification system using multimodal information to recognize the assembly skill, called MASD, is proposed including: 1) an initial learning stage using a hierarchical model to recognize the action by considering the features from action-object effect, gesture, and trajectory and 2) a retrospective thinking stage using a segmentation method to cut the continuous demonstrations into multiple assembly skills optimally. Using MASD, the demonstration of assembly tasks can be explained with high accuracy in real time, driving a hypothesis that a PBD system on the top of MASD can be extended to more realistic assembly tasks beyond pure positional moving and picking. In experiments, the skill identification module is used to recognize the five kinds of assembly skills in demonstrations of both single and multiple assembly skills, and outperforms the comparative action identification methods. Besides integrated with the MASD, the PBD system can generate the program based on the demonstration and successfully enable an ABB industrial robotic arm simulator to assemble a flashlight and a switch, verifying the initial hypothesis. Note to Practitioners-In the conventional robotized automation, the key role of the robot mainly owes to its capacity for repeating a wide variety of tasks with high speed and accuracy in long term, with a cost of days to months of programming for deployment. On the other hand, the new trend of customization brings the new characteristics: production in short cycle and small volume. This irreversible momentum urges the robot to switch from task to task efficiently. The biggest bottleneck here is the tedious programming, which also has high prerequisites for most practitioners in manufacturing. This situation motivates the development of a PBD system that can understand the assembly skills performed by the human experts in the demonstration and accordingly generate the program for robot's execution of the taught task. In this paper, we present a skill decoding system to parse the observational raw demonstration into symbolic sequences, which is the crucial bridge to enable the automatic programming. The system achieves high performance in recognition and is tailored for the PBD in assembly tasks by considering both advantages and disadvantages in the background of assembly, such as controllable environment and limited computational resources. It is particularly useful for assembly tasks with modularized actions based on a set of standard parts. At the perspective of industrial application, the PBD upon the proposed system is a promising solution to improve the flexibility of manufacture, which is expected to be true in midterm but an important step toward this goal.},

  abstract={Technology and computer learning have acquired a great projection in the field of education. Arduino arises from current technological innovations with the intention of promoting a new approach to learning through machines. The objective of this research is to analyze the evolution of the Arduino concept in the scientific literature. To achieve this aim, a bibliometric methodology based on scientific mapping and an analysis of co-words has been used. The scientific production of Arduino indexed in Web of Science has been analyzed. We have worked with an analysis unit of 346 documents. The results of this research show that the scientific production on Arduino in the field of education starts in 2010 until today. The communications in the congresses to present the results of the investigations developed are the most used means of diffusion. The National University of Distance Education and the Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu are particularly noteworthy. The authors with more scientific production in this field of study are Bogdan, M. and Castro, M. It is significant that the collection of studies on this subject is carried out, above all, by EDULEARN Proceedings and INTED Proceedings. It can be concluded that the field of study on Arduino in the educational field is relatively recent, so that today, the basis for scientific research is still being established. However, the most relevant aspects in this field of study are physic experiments, computational thinking and computer-based learning.},

  abstract={Discusses a new approach to understanding how the brain organizes computation. Progress in understanding the brain function under constant interactions with the sensory environment is hampered by inadequate models and theories. Obviously, current models and theories of brain computing still appear irrelevant when they are confronted with real-world problems. We argue that architecture in the brain does not reflect the result of thinking, the ready-made algorithm for solving a problem. Rather it should reflect the control that generates the constraints to select a proper algorithm for a specific problem that is posed by the input-or to create a new one if the application of the previously acquired ones does not provide a sufficient solution. We propose that a value system (based on a genetically imprinted a priori knowledge on coarse behavioral evaluation of sensory input) and neocortical columnar architecture are crucial elements of future artificial neural systems that are expected to emulate the performance of the brain. This should be the case especially for those cognitive tasks that appear easy for animals in their everyday life but turn out to be hopelessly tricky for the current generation of computers. In order to advance beyond the well known paradigms of current computational theory, we need a more functional understanding of brain-type computation.},

  pages={211-222},
  abstract={Millions of people around the world are affected by one or more mental disorders that interfere in their thinking and behavior. A timely detection of these issues is challenging but crucial, since it could open the possibility to offer help to people before the illness gets worse. One alternative to accomplish this is to monitor how people express themselves, that is for example what and how they write, or even a step further, what emotions they express in their social media communications. In this article, we analyze two computational representations that aim to model the presence and changes of the emotions expressed by social media users. In our evaluation we use two recent public data sets for two important mental disorders: Depression and Anorexia. The obtained results suggest that the presence and variability of emotions, captured by the proposed representations, allow to highlight important information about social media users suffering from depression or anorexia. Furthermore, the fusion of both representations can boost the performance, equalling the best reported approach for depression and barely behind the top performer for anorexia by only 1 percent. Moreover, these representations open the possibility to add some interpretability to the results.},

  abstract={Scratch Day is made up of a global network of events. Its main goal is to bring people together to celebrate Scratch. Scratch is a free encryption platform that can be used online and offline for children. Scratch Day events bring together young people from the Scratch community. During these meetings, attendees share projects, learn from each other and welcome newcomers. Robotics and computational thinking are ideal tools for developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. Currently, innovation and motivation of students during the learning process are promoted by educational robotics tools. Robots are increasingly integrated into our society. To such an extent that robots are becoming more and more common in our everyday environment. This paper presents a workshop which is focused on two main objectives. The first one is to celebrate Scratch Day promoting Scratch locally. On the other hand, this event is aimed to present a robotic educational tool for people as the first step to get into robotics world. This workshop is aimed on those adults who want to discover what possibilities Scratch brings in the introduction to robotics. Throughout this workshop an initiation to Scratch is developed in the context of educational robotics. As the most significant results throughout the workshop, it is clearly demonstrated that Scratch is an ideal tool for children and adults with no previous programming or robotic experience to begin learning both through hands-on experiences. Throughout this work the importance of combining theory and practice is shown in order to include fun tasks intertwined with the challenges of applying theory to problem solving.},

  abstract={Mobile learning has a lot of potential for supporting learning in situations such as in a museum, at a tourist sight or when exploring biological phenomena at a riverside. There learners can interact with their environment and still make use of the advantages of computational power. However, we have found many of such projects hindered by placing the technology too much in the focus of the learner. Instead of interacting with the environment, we found the learners interacting with the device, heads down and ignoring the environment. We found the issue of focus to be a massive problem, one which needs a completely new metaphor for the design of an educational and technical setting. Until now, the mobile devices have been interpreted as small desktops, always in the foreground of the learners' focus. Instead, we propose a different approach, deduced from the usage of mobile phones. Mobile applications need to be designed explicitly to free the learners' focus and push the application to the background. The good news is that the actual changes to be made in existing systems are not as fundamental as one may think},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the most popular technologies that have emerged in recent years, and its reputation comes from its importance and its real role in changing things for the better, we started from smartphones that opened a new perspective for the technical world around us, and later came cloud computing with new thinking and mindset about the use of computational powers. The tools of artificial intelligence and machine learning are then shown and a new horizon of computing power and capabilities is spreading, and recently with the advent of the IoT we may see a different technological future, the IoT has changed technical realities and created a real need to redefine computing. Its wide spread created many intelligent environments, such as smart homes and smart cities, that facilitate the life around us. Although it leads to significant development, there are still doubts about the security concepts in IoT-based systems. In this paper, a design of IoT architecture is proposed, and it displays the security challenges, issues, and requirements of the smart home/cities security, it discusses security attacks in IoT systems, then the security countermeasures that can be followed and takes on a real-life scenario on an IoT-based environment.},

  abstract={Advances in wireless technology have resulted in pervasive deployment of devices of a high variability in form factors, memory and computational ability. The need for maintaining continuous connections that deliver data with high reliability necessitate re-thinking of conventional design of the transport layer protocol. This paper investigates the use of Q-learning in TCP cwnd adaptation during the congestion avoidance state, wherein the classical alternation of the window is replaced, thereby allowing the protocol to immediately respond to previously seen network conditions. Furthermore, it demonstrates how memory plays a critical role in building the exploration space, and proposes ways to reduce this overhead through function approximation. The superior performance of the learning-based approach over TCP New Reno is demonstrated through a comprehensive simulation study, revealing 33.8% and 12.1% improvement in throughput and delay, respectively, for the evaluated topologies. We also show how function approximation can be used to dramatically reduce the memory requirements of a learning-based protocol while maintaining the same throughput and delay.},

  abstract={Although mutation analysis is considered the best way to evaluate the effectiveness of a test suite, hefty computational cost often limits its use. To address this problem, various mutation reduction strategies have been proposed, all seeking to reduce the number of mutants while maintaining the representativeness of an exhaustive mutation analysis. While research has focused on the reduction achieved, the effectiveness of these strategies in selecting representative mutants, and the limits in doing so have not been investigated, either theoretically or empirically. We investigate the practical limits to the effectiveness of mutation reduction strategies, and provide a simple theoretical framework for thinking about the absolute limits. Our results show that the limit in improvement of effectiveness over random sampling for real-world open source programs is a mean of only 13.078%. Interestingly, there is no limit to the improvement that can be made by addition of new mutation operators. Given that this is the maximum that can be achieved with perfect advance knowledge of mutation kills, what can be practically achieved may be much worse. We conclude that more effort should be focused on enhancing mutations than removing operators in the name of selective mutation for questionable benefit.},

  abstract={There is a strong worldwide movement which is pushing for the teaching of serious computer science principles besides reading, writing and basic numeracy starting from first grade and reaching all students across all grades. This is being done through both formal initiatives carried out by international organizations and at the national level by putting forward curricula, some of which are mandatory. In order to accomplish this goal, and based on the consensus that computer science is not programming and that programming languages are a tool, visual languages have become the preferred method for teaching introductory courses in computer science. The absence of rigid syntactic rules makes them the ideal tool for focusing on problem solving and computational thinking activities. Recent reports have pointed out the need for supporting the international community of teachers by providing assessment methods, an internationally validated question repository as well as tools and assessment platforms. In this context our work presents an assessment platform for formative, summative and informal assessment of computer science competencies by using a visual language, namely App Inventor, which allows for the rapid development of a mobile app and has a strong appeal to the younger generation of students. The capability to log user activity allows the teacher to monitor the progression in the student's learning path as well as her/his solution-building approach.},

  abstract={Current desktop-GIS software cannot answer users' spatial questions directly. The GIS functionality is hard to identify and use without specific training of GIS skills because of the complex hierarchical organization and the gap between users' spatial thinking and systems' implement descriptions. In order to bridge this gap, we propose a semantic framework for designing a question-based user interface that integrates different levels of ontologies (spatial concept ontology, domain ontology and task ontology) to guide the process of extracting the core spatial concepts and translating them into a set of equivalent computational or operational GIS tasks. We also list some typical spatial questions that might be posed for spatial analysis and computation. The principle introduced in this paper could be applied not only to desktop-GIS software but also to web map services. The semantic framework would be useful to enhance the ability of spatial reasoning in web search engines (e.g. Google semantic search) and answering questions in location-based services as well (e.g. iPhone Siri assistant).},

  abstract={Supersingular isogeny key encapsulation (SIKE) protocol delivers promising public and secret key sizes over other post-quantum candidates. However, the huge computations form the bottleneck and limit its practical applications. The modular multiplication operation, which is one of the most computationally demanding operations in the fundamental arithmetics, takes up a large part of the computations in the protocol. In this paper, we propose an improved unconventional-radix finite-field multiplication (IFFM) algorithm which reduces the computational complexity by about 20% compared to previous algorithms. We then devise a new high-speed modular multiplier architecture based on the IFFM. It is shown that the proposed architecture can be extensively pipelined to achieve a very high clock speed due to its complete feedforward scheme, which demonstrates significant advantages over conventional designs. The FPGA implementation results show the proposed multiplier has about 67 times faster throughput than the state-of-the-art designs and more than 12 times better area efficiency than previous works. Therefore, we think that these achievements will greatly contribute to the practicability of this protocol.},

  volume={23},

  pages={1479-1489},
  abstract={Schizophrenia (SZ) is a chronic and severe mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. It has been proposed that this disorder is related to disrupted brain connectivity, which has been verified by many studies. With the development of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), further exploration of brain connectivity was made possible. Region-based networks are commonly used for mapping brain connectivity. However, they fail to illustrate the connectivity within regions of interest (ROIs) and lose precise location information. Voxel-based networks provide higher precision, but are difficult to construct and interpret due to the high dimensionality of the data. In this paper, we adopt a novel high-dimensional Gaussian graphical model – $\psi$-learning method, which can help ease computational burden and provide more accurate inference for the underlying networks. This method has been proven to be an equivalent measure of the partial correlation coefficient and, thus, is flexible for network comparison through statistical tests. The fMRI data we used were collected by the mind clinical imaging consortium using an auditory task in which there are 92 SZ patients and 116 healthy controls. We compared the networks at three different scales by using global measurements, community structure, and edge-wise comparisons within the networks. Our results reveal, at the highest voxel resolution, sets of distinct aberrant patterns for the SZ patients, and more precise local structures are provided within ROIs for further investigation.},

  abstract={Active Methodologies allow an active process in teaching and learning contents, promote responsible student involvement and bring satisfaction and enrichment to educational practices and active learning. Generally, students have learning difficulties in Computer Science courses, as they need to develop computational skills and thinking. The goals of this article is to characterize and analyze the types of Active Methodologies that are being applied in teaching and learning activities in Computer Science. Thus, this investigation was carried out through a Systematic Mapping Study, focusing on the use of the types of methodologies in view of the results achieved. It presents students’ perceptions, benefits, and difficulties in adopting these methodologies in the classroom. The results show 6 types of different Active Methodologies used in 35 publications selected, different types of techniques or studies that were used, the publications trend per year, the courses that were worked in analyzed publications, and some benefits and difficulty related to the adoption of Active Methodologies. Regarding to students’ perception, we identified different type feelings. Thus, the contributions of this study consist in a research focused on the use of Active Methodologies in a very broad sense, including the perceptions of teachers and students regarding the use of different teaching and learning methodologies. In addition, it shows the specific benefits and possible difficulties experienced in the use of Active Methodologies as teaching strategies. Consequently, some findings from this study may have the potential to support or direct choices of these methodologies in different Computer Science courses.},

  abstract={In a world with intensive computational services and require optimal solutions, cloud security is a critical concern. As a known fact, the cloud is a diverse field in which data is crucial, and as a result, it invites the dark world to enter and create a virtual menace to businesses, governments, and technology that is facilitated by the cloud. This article addresses the fundamentals of cloud computing, as well as security and threats in various applications. This research study will explore how security is remaining as a potential risk for cloud users across the globe by listing some of the cloud applications. Some viable solutions and security measures that could help us in analyzing cloud security threats are reviewed. The analyzed solutions include profound analytical thinking on how to render the solutions more impactful in each scenario. Several cloud security solutions are available to assist businesses in reducing costs and enhancing security. This study discover that if the risks are taken into consideration without any delay then the matter of solutions gets divided into four pillars, which will assist us in obtaining a more comprehensive knowledge. Visibility, compute-based security, network protection, and lastly identity security are referred as four pillars.},

  abstract={The pedagogy of science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) can be easily developed by using robotics and computational thinking tools. Also, inclusion and integration of diverse groups of students can be promoted using these tools. Today we can find many tools for teaching robotics. This kind of tools allow us to promote innovation and motivation of students. In this way, students will be able to work during the learning process in an innovative and motivating way. Since it is increasingly common to find robots in our daily lives, it is important to integrate robots into education as well. There are already cooking robots, autonomous cars, vacuum cleaner robots in houses and gardens, or prostheses. This paper describes a course focused on a combination of teaching methodologies, educational robotics tools, and a student learning management methodology, all within an inclusive framework to strengthen the presence of women and other under-represented groups in engineering.},

  abstract={The computational demands of multimedia data processing are steadily increasing as consumers call for progressively more complex and intelligent multimedia services. New multi-core hardware architectures provide the required resources, but writing parallel, distributed applications remains a labor-intensive task compared to their sequential counter-part. For this reason, Google and Microsoft implemented their respective processing frameworks MapReduce and Dryad, as they allow the developer to think sequentially, yet benefit from parallel and distributed execution. An inherent limitation in the design of these batch processing frameworks is their inability to express arbitrarily complex workloads. The dependency graphs of the frameworks are often limited to directed acyclic graphs, or even pre-determined stages. This is particularly problematic for video encoding and other algorithms that depend on iterative execution. With the Nornir runtime system for parallel programs, which is a Kahn Process Network implementation, we addressed and solved several of these limitations. However, it is more difficult to use than other frameworks due to its complex programming model. In this paper, we build on the knowledge gained from Nornir and present a new framework, called P2G, designed specifically for developing and processing distributed real-time multimedia data. P2G supports arbitrarily complex dependency graphs with cycles, branches and deadlines, and provides both data- and task-parallelism. The framework is implemented to scale transparently with available (heterogeneous) resources, a concept familiar from the cloud computing paradigm. We have implemented an (interchangeable) P2G kernel language to ease development. In this paper, we present a proof of concept implementation of a P2G execution node and some experimental examples using complex workloads like Motion JPEG and K-means clustering. The results show that the P2G system is a feasible approach to multimedia processing.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence technologies are progressing into fields that were formerly believed to be still the domain of domain analysts. Thanks to recent advances in digital form of information processing, artificial learning, and computational resources, which helped personnel involved in healthcare services in various domains. In certain cases, AI and NLP can handle healthcare functions even well than individuals. One of the area in which machine learning along with natural language processing can work is psychological diseases. Anomalous thinking, emotions, and actions are characteristics of mental illnesses. Aberrant inner interactions and actions that defy social expectations could indicate the existence of a cognitive disease. This research paper proposes a cognitive disease prediction model for psychological disorders like, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia. In the mainstream medical industry, providing cognitive health treatment entails new ways to treat individuals with mental illnesses. Proposed e-healthcare systems provide an extra layer which helps healthcare professional and patients by saving their time in early diagnosis.},

  abstract={The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is becoming a widely used tool in image processing and other data analysis areas. A non-conventional variation of a spatiotemporal 3D DWT has been developed in order to analyze motion in time-sequential imagery. The computational complexity of this algorithm is /spl Theta/(n/sup 3/), where n is the number of samples in each dimension of the input image sequence. Methods are needed to increase the speed of these computations for large data sets. Fortunately, wavelet decomposition is very amenable to parallelization. Coarse-grained parallel versions of this process have been designed and implemented on three different architectures: a distributed network represented by a distributed network of Sun SPARCstation 2 workstations: two Intel hypercubes (an iPSC/2 and an iPSC/860); and a Thinking Machines Corporation CM-5, a massively parallel SPMD. This non-conventional 3D wavelet decomposition is very suitable for coarse-grain implementation on parallel computers with proper load balancing. Close to linear speedup over serial implementations has been achieved using a distributed network. Near-linear speedup was obtained on the hypercubes and the CM-5 for a variety of image-processing applications.<>},

  abstract={Although recent years have seen an explosion in educational technology, there is still a lack of computational tools specifically designed to encourage exploration of identity and communication issues. Storytelling is a good medium for this type of exploration as it enables reflection about the inner world. The paper presents a novel approach to interactive storytelling: SAGE (Storytelling Agent Generation Environment), a construction kit that supports children's creation of their own wise storytellers to interact with. In this system, programming is a vehicle for the transformation of ways of thinking about communication as well as for constructing knowledge about technology. In order to encourage children's emotional engagement in the SAGE environment, the storytellers are embodied in an interactive stuffed animal-a soft interface-which is also programmable by the children. The paper presents some technical aspects of SAGE's design and implementation and focuses on empirical results from research with children using SAGE.},

  abstract={The authors present the results of an architectural comparison of SIMD (single-instruction multiple-data) massive parallelism, as implemented in the Thinking Machines Corp. CM-2, and vector or concurrent-vector processing, as implemented in the Cray Research Inc., Y-MP/8. The comparison is based primarily upon three application codes taken from the LANL (Los Alamos National Laboratory) CM-2 workload. Tests were run by porting CM Fortran codes to the Y-MP, so that nearly the same level of optimization was obtained on both machines. The results for fully configured systems, using measured data rather than scaled data from smaller configurations, show that the Y-MP/8 is faster than the 64 k CM-2 for all three codes. A simple model that accounts for the relative characteristic computational speeds of the two machines, and reduction in overall CM-2 performance due to communication or SIMD conditional execution, accurately predicts the performance of two of the three codes. The authors show the similarity of the CM-2 and Y-MP programming models and comment on selected future massively parallel processor designs.<>},
