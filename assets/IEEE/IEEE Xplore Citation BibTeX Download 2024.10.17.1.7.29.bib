  abstract={The long-term goal of artificial intelligence (AI) is to provide machines the capabilities to learn, think and reason like humans. To achieve these long-term goals, it is necessary to introduce human cognitive-like abilities into AI systems to create truly self-adaptive artificially intelligent systems. This marriage of human cognitive skills with “machines” creates hybrid systems that have characteristics of both. The question becomes, which human cognitive model is appropriate for hybrid artificial intelligent systems. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the development of cognitive models to be infused into a modern radar system to create a Cognitive Radar System (CRS). The notion of a hybrid artificially intelligent system can be divided into two main categories: (a) human-in-the-loop systems with hybrid augmented intelligence requiring human-AI communication/ collaboration, and (b) a cognitive computing-based AI in which a fully cognitive model is infused into the machine to allow fully autonomous operation. Here, we discuss the first type, human-in-the-loop cognitive radar systems that provide intelligent decision support and analysis for radar systems. The design of hybrid artificial intelligence methods and algorithms are presented with applications to improvement to modern radar systems, utilizing a Rasmussen Cognition Model (RCM), which we feel is appropriate for a hybrid cognitive system utilized to create a Cognitive Radar System (CRS).},

  abstract={An expert system for pattern recognition based on features and knowledge is realized, and the theoretical and practical problems involved are discussed. The system, designed for analysis of geological patterns, has two novel characteristics. First, the system uses both features and knowledge for its analysis; there is some interaction between the two types of data. Secondly, the control strategy is based on an incomplete-reasoning and regression thinking model. The system is realized and proved to be effective.<>},

  abstract={As everyone is aware of the fact that in this technological era, we all are familiar with the online shopping and the feedbacks associated with them. Since the reviews, ratings and feedback are crucial part of any business to keep track of what are views of the customers on the product. The reviews are the only way to keep up with the customer’s needs, advices and corrections that needs to be in the product. For a single type of product which a company sells, includes millions of reviews associated with it and a proper channel is needed to be employed to work with it so as to filter out the information what a customer thinks about the product or how the product is performing in the market. In this paper, authors compared the Ensemble Classifier with other algorithms like logistic regression, SVM, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree and Multinomial and found out that Ensemble Classifier outperformed the mentioned machine learning algorithms.},

While doing the research work the algebraic-topological apparatus for identifying fractal-time structure of the observed signal based on physical phenomenology and p-adic metrics was used. The main result of the work is a new cognitive strategy of multidimensional methodological thinking, based on the following principles: modeling, diversification, complementarity, virtualization, tolerance, duality. The conclusions emphasize the relationship between asynchronous VI-environments ideology and Bergson's philosophy: the events produced by VI-environment components interaction, are objectively exist - they appear and disappear, simulating, thus, some continuous time flow.},

Python language is one of the freeware and can be used to implement IOT applications using Raspberry Pi. In most of the industries python programming language is widely used for various test automation. Initially the python language is introduced to implement numerical computation algorithms, so that the students are familiar with the basic libraries. Then the open ended experiment is carried out using Raspberry Pi for IOT applications. In this experiment the students are sensing and retrieving data from the cloud. With this approach the students are exposed to python programming and IOT concepts which is most widely used in industry. It also helps the students to carry out higher semester projects in IOT based applications in a better way.},

  abstract={I'd like to really know how a bird feels when it is flying, just as though my mind was in the bird's body. I think this is a dream that can come true in the next couple of decades. Computer graphics has pointed the way, by showing that we can simulate one human sense-vision. As we refine our synthetic images, we can make similar progress in other senses to let people envelop themselves in richly sensate worlds, both artificial and natural. Computer graphics begins by simulating the physics of the environment under study, determining the light falling on key parts of the scene. We can stop there if our goal is analytical, but to show the result to a person, we need to take a second step and get the image into the mind of the observer. We do this by transforming the computed data into a form that controls devices that stimulate our sense of sight. Computer graphics has validated the model of sense synthesis, showing that we can model, simulate and present an environment so well that, under controlled conditions, neutral observers cannot tell reality from simulation. As time progresses, I expect that this test will succeed for increasingly complex scenes, and we'll extend our abilities to the other human senses.},

  abstract={Alzheimer's disease is a neurological condition that gradually affects memory, thinking, and reasoning abilities as well as daily functioning. The majority of people with this condition are elderly, particularly those over 65. The exact cause of this disease is still unknown, but it is now thought that it may be inherited, unintentional, or brought on by other factors. Actual assessment, CT examines, X-ray sweeps, and positron emission tomography, are a couple of techniques to analyze the disease, but X-ray checks are the most widely recognized one. Additionally, scanned images from MRI scans are used in this study. This study has established four groups for the condition: healthy, mildly demented, moderately demented, and very mildly demented. The most famous SVM technique is utilized in our proposed model along with a profound learning calculation because of its fast, trustworthy, and compelling activity. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and uniformed through pre-processing. After the information was parted into preparing and testing datasets in a 80:20 proportion, tuner advancement was done to naturally pick various boundaries to improve the model. The ailment and its classification are then resolved utilizing the SVM grouping and the model's exactness is 99.4%. In order to diagnose the patient's condition and discover an appropriate course of treatment and therapy, it helps the doctors identify the disease and the degree of its dissemination.},

  abstract={The growing population has added a burden to the existing power generation station. So what if the demand by the people exceeds the generation capability. The consequence is power deficiency. The world has to remain in dark weighing down the economy of the country. The alternative solution for this is generation mix. Now a day's commercial building is increasing at a greater pace. So in addition to generation mix we are thinking of making it economic. Economic is in the sense of reducing the grid dependency of a commercial building. Through this the cost incurred by a commercial building can be minimized to a greater extent, which can be utilized for some additional utilities. Generation mix includes the ultimate energy coming from sun, wind, tidal, geo-thermal, bio-gas, bio-mass. In this paper, aims at encouraging the use of renewable energy sources such as Wind and Solar, available with the commercial building along with grid connection. A case study of National Institute of Science & Technology (NIST), Berhampur, Odisha, has been considered to validate the efficacy of the proposed methodology and the result is estimated mathematically and verified through the renewable Simulink Software Homer V 2.81 incorporating present load and forecasted load for 4 years of planning horizon.},

  abstract={This paper presents a preliminary framework using back propagation neural networks for performability evaluation of Kerberos servers. In the modelling approach, keys under pseudo-secure conditions are dynamically renewed and also, temporary interruption to link/server access is involved. This interruption has implications on mortification of system's performance. Since this effects the network communication's cost, an analytical model is created for evaluation. Analytical model's results provide understanding on the values of authentication key renewal(restoration) times, times passed between renewals(restorations) and failures(breakdowns) of the server. Additionally, another distinctive way of critical thinking and problem solving is suggested, and an intelligent system using back propagation neural networks is applied to detect performability modelling.},

  abstract={The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is in charge of the route exchange at the Internet scale. Anomalies in BGP can have several causes (misconfigurations, outages and attacks). Forged AS paths are small scale and subtle attacks on BGP and therefore are hard to detect. In this paper we use a Machine Learning (ML) model applying a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture to take the temporal aspect of BGP into account. We show that our ML model is able to detect forged AS path anomalies with an accuracy of 67% and a precision of 72%. These preliminary results outperform the existing proposals and allow us to think that ML on temporal graphs is worth investigating.},

  year={2014},

  pages={281-282},
  abstract={Modeling propagation dynamics on networks is an amazingly fertile and active area of research. Roughly speaking, network models aim at gaining a better understanding of how actors influence the overall network behaviour through their individual actions. However, considering the extended literature surrounding the subject, one is entitled to think that moving beyond the state-of-the-art in network modeling requires the ability to compare models, or consider slight variations of a model. This requires having a common language describing all considered models, allowing to objectively compare them and unfold their inherent properties and complexity. This also assumes users can easily run models, steer them and interactively evaluate their performance and behaviour. The approach we describe aims at providing a framework turning network propagation modeling into rule-based modeling (aka graph rewriting). That is, models are described as a set of algorithmic transformation rules acting locally. Our approach has partially been validated by providing such a description of a well-known model relying on probabilistic rules, where nodes trigger actions depending on their neighbor's influences. The results so obtained confirm rule-based modeling as a promising avenue. The use of a visual analytics framework to conduct such tasks is vital and motivated us to further develop and adapt a general purpose visual analytics system for graph rewriting to the particular case of network propagation.},

A dance activity was designed as an analogy to the OSI model of a communications system. To identify student perceptions of the activity, a survey was conducted of all students. The obtained results confirm that the students agree that this activity enables understanding and makes the learning process interesting.

  abstract={Recent years have seen rapid gaming development. As development speeds up, game complexity rises. Software engineers are using agile methodologies to enhance output. In this paper, a meta-model-based computer gaming model is shown. The meta-model was created for design reusability, with the purpose of building codes that automatically make implementations in a well-defined manner by constructing the sections individually and independently for implementation. Early game makers had little industry or resources. Space-time game modeling aids in computer game creation describes related topics and provides a game metamodel. Hand-coded parts and regulations make it harder to adapt to different game areas. MDD is an innovative software development method. Some people think drawing is enough to build a model. Diagrams are also needed. Models must have a well-defined, abstract syntax-illustrative structure consistent with met models. Building a space-time model for games allows for model language research. Meta models and OCL can close the design-implementation gap. The code structure facilitates sorting and querying models.},

  volume={},

  pages={1069-1072},
  abstract={Clustering can be a valuable tool for analyzing large amounts of data, but anyone who clusters must choose how many item clusters, K, to report. Unfortunately, one must guess at K or some related parameter when working within each of the three available frameworks where one thinks of clustering: as a Euclidean distance problem; as a statistical model problem; or as a complexity theory problem. We report here a novel recursive square root heuristic, RSQRT, which accurately predicts Kreported as a function of the attribute or item count, depending on attribute scales. We tested the heuristic on 226 widely-varying, but mostly scientific, studies, and found that the heuristic's Kbest-predicted rounded to exactly Kreported in over half of the studies and was close in almost all of them. We claim that this strongly-supported heuristic makes sense and that, although it is not prescriptive, using it prospectively is much better than guessing.},

The ability of computer-assisted diagnosis to serve as a primary screening test for many illnesses, including cancer, has contributed to its rise in popularity in recent years. Deep learning is an artificial intelligence technology that gives computers intelligence by programming them to think like people. In this study, we explore the feasibility of training a deep neural network to provide such a prediction for breast cancer. Information is taken from a UCI-supplied dataset on breast cancer in Wisconsin. Over fitting is prevented by the early halting mechanism and the dropout layers in the neural network model, which together allow for an F1 score of more than 97.},

The home agent takes into account the degree of importance and pleasure of the operation pattern. In this paper, we propose a home agent that predicts the user's operation, detects forgotten operation and supposes a degree of importance and pleasure for an operation pattern and evaluated its performance in a simulated environment.},

  abstract={With the gradual expansion of computer network services, the demand of various services for the network is also increasing. In order to ensure the normal and effective deployment of network services, it is necessary to improve or guarantee the key quality of service (QoS) in specific services as much as possible. In the application of computer network technology, artificial intelligence can simulate people's wisdom and thinking, and apply it in mechanical equipment, gradually making the application objects break away from manual control mode and become intelligent or automatic control mode. Internet has gradually become the mainstream communication mode, but there are still some problems to be solved urgently, the key of which is the optimization of computer network service quality. Based on various artificial intelligence technologies, this paper discusses the current situation and solutions of realizing service quality on the network, analyzes and summarizes the principles and characteristics of key technologies of service quality assurance, and finally looks forward to the development of network service quality technology.},

  abstract={We use a digital adaptation of classical Morse theory to organize (typically density based) interpolated geometry in sampled data. The heart of this new thinking is the recognition and cataloging (indexing) of the transition between families of iso-surfaces at criticalities, as the threshold is varied, into a hierarchical criticality graph, with associated zones. The methods work without any assumption that the underlying function is Morse, in the traditional sense. Using our combinatorial approach, we completely characterize all critical points and structures in multi-dimensional sampled functions. We give an efficient algorithm for computing the criticality graph and zones. We demonstrate that the criticality graph and associated zones have a number of important properties, including the following: Each zone has an associated real interval. Each level set boundary iso-surface (at any threshold) is completely contained within component of a zone. A zone component contains an iso-surface if and only if the iso-value lies within the range of the zone. Moreover, for any pair of iso-values in this range, the iso-surfaces within a zone component are topologically equivalent (homeomorphic). We use this software to build a graph of a representative region of the visible human project CT image database as a test case.},

  abstract={Any agent-based model (ABM) involving agents that think or make decisions must inevitably have some model of agent cognition. Often, this cognitive model is incredibly simple, such as choosing actions at random or based on simple conditionals. In reality, agent cognition can be complex and dynamic, and for some models, this process can be worthy of its own dedicated ABM. The LevelSpace extension (Hjorth, Head & Wilensky, 2015) for NetLogo (Wilensky 1999) allows NetLogo models to open instances of other NetLogo models and interact with them. We demonstrate a method for using LevelSpace to simulate agents with complex, evolving cognitive models. We give the agents in a NetLogo predator-prey model "brains" themselves represented as independent instances of a NetLogo neural network model.},
