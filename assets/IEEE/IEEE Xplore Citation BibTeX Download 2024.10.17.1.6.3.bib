  abstract={Fault attack is the very effective way to attack RSA cryptosystem, especially when it is implemented on embedded devices. Moreover, the fault attack methods become more and more advance, and there are some fault attacks on RSA public elements in recent years. Among publish attacks, Brier et al.'s attack make people to think that it is necessary to protect RSA public elements. In this paper, we introduce Brier et al.'s attack to attack MIST algorithm and propose corresponding countermeasure.},

  abstract={Humans frequently communicate effectively using their faces in addition to their words. The use of computer vision techniques to categorize face emotion has been extensively studied. Given the difficulties and restrictions of databases, such as the use of static data or facial capture in artificial contexts, these have had different degrees of success. As a result, we think that novel preprocessing methods are necessary to increase the precision of facial expression detection models. In this study, we suggest a novel, yet straightforward, approach to improving the precision of face emotion identification. Our research was done using the FER2013 dataset, which includes static facial photos of 7 basic emotions. Resizing and Normalization image preprocessing techniques were applied on the dataset prior to the splitting into train and test sets. The training images were split into train and test sets in the ratios of 75% and 25% respectively. The facial expressions in the photos were classified using Convolution Neural Networks [CNNs], with an accuracy of 76.75% on the test set.},

  abstract={The division of a micro-video course content is needed in order to think about decomposition and correlation design of the course content. This paper analyses the principle of dividing a micro-video course content, and defines the connotation and classification of knowledge points in a micro-video course. Based on the analysis of instructional objectives, the decomposition of a micro-video course content can be implemented by the methods of classification analysis, interpretative structural modelling, and hierarchy analysis. In addition, based on analysing the type and relations of knowledge points, ontology metadata modelling of knowledge points can make the knowledge points correlate with each other, ensuring the integrity of the micro-video course content, and the reusability of the instructional micro-video with a knowledge point-based design.},

  abstract={In the circumstances that evidences are highly or full conflict, D-S evidence combination method may lose effectiveness, for this reason some improved methods of evidence combination are given in succession. Some scholars think, different evidence source is under different circumstance, so the importance of each evidence source is different. In the conditions that evidences are highly or full conflict, it is necessary to give weight to every evidence source, then conflict probability can only just be assigned. In this paper, we construct an evaluating standard with basic proposition and its rough combined probability value, to calculate the weight coefficient of every evidence source, based on that, conflict probability is assigned, combination of evidences is built. In this method, subjective information from decision-makers is used, and objective information from evidences is also used, only little artificial job is needed. This method can be achieved on computer easily, and satisfying consequence can be obtained.},

  abstract={“India's agriculture is its lifeline.” The production of agriculture depends on fertilisers. One of the main issues that farmers face is a lack of information regarding the necessary fertiliser amounts. Farmers think that when fertiliser use rises, production rises as well. This, however, is untrue since the soil just uses what it need and leaves the remainder behind. Overuse results in leaching, a decrease in the natural fertility of the soil, and other problems. A solution is to make it possible for farmers to test their soil and use fertilisers in accordance with the needs of the soil at a reasonable cost. This study describes the development of a low-cost soil nutrient detection method using pre-made capsules. Here, it is possible to do three different nutritional tests for sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. In this experiment, three test tubes are used, and after adding varied amounts of dirt and water to each, the mixture is stirred for 15 minutes. After then, the tube starts to change colour. A colour sensor is used in this instance, and it recognises the colour shift in the test tubes and compares it to the information previously known about the colour deficit. The farmer is advised of the shortage and how much fertiliser is necessary to make up for it once the sensor data is analysed using Arduino.},

  abstract={Summary form only given. An intelligent robot is different with the traditional mobile robot. The traditional mobile robot uses a powerful microcontroller to control the movement, with the help of sensing devices it normally is able to make a tactic decision but could not do any sophisticate thinking since the limitation of the computation power provided by microcontroller. However, the intelligent robot adds a separate layer of computation core, such as laptop or a single motherboard, on the top of the movement control microcontroller. That means, by adding a "brain' the traditional mobile robot is upgraded to an intelligent machine, which is capable to undertake many sophisticate environment sensing and decision making. The prototype version of the intelligent management algorithm for swarmed intelligent robots has been simulated using Matlab and it is currently tested and evaluated using advanced intelligent robots system.},

Another problem greatly handicaps knowledge acquisition is semantic gap which is caused by lacking of knowledge about processing. Inspired by the Monte Carlo thinking and psychological facts, architecture of theories and appropriate knowledge acquisition and problem solving methods are advanced. Semantic gap and incoherence can be effectively handled with the architecture. Knowledge acquisition and problem solving can be greatly enhanced in efficiency and accuracy by implementing the architecture because of the bridging of incoherence by the theory architecture.},

In the early stages of software development the security can be handled and managed. There is sufficient material available in early stages to take into account for security testing. Here the detailed structure of the software is available. As the requirement phase is the first phase, the detailed requirements are also available. To have a secure system it is necessary to start thinking and working on security during inception of the software development.

  abstract={The Internet has a unique promise for transaction cost reduction within an enterprise as well as across enterprises. However, the traditional planning frameworks are confined to organizational boundaries and typically do not embrace the concept of an extended enterprise where all external constituencies of an enterprise are considered as a part of the enterprise. Yet, crossing the traditional organizational boundaries is precisely what the concept, methods, and techniques of Internet envision. To fully reap the benefits of Internet technology, an organization must be willing to seek out new opportunities and engage new thinking to extend its horizon into extended enterprises and ultimately the global village as manifested in the Internet community. A new planning framework espousing this vision is, thus, needed for Internet enterprises. We applied a reference model for this purpose and analyzed its use with some case studies in banking and heavy machinery industries. In this paper we describe the model and the methodology for planning for Internet in businesses.},

  abstract={Maintenance of the patient respiratory passage (airway) open and unobstructed breathing is a foremost duty of an anesthesiologist or other physicians who are involved in patient care under emergency situations. One of the main reasons for respiratory related problems is unanticipated difficult airway (unexpected difficulty in maintaining the face mask or passing an endotracheal to maintaining the continuous opening of the airway). If the doctor under duty fails to keep the airway open, it may lead to death or permanent bodily harm of patient, because of inadequate oxygenation. There is no readily available software solutions at present for predicting the exact probability of difficulty in mask ventilation and/or endotracheal intubation. Hence there is an urgent need to develop an expert system solution to support the anesthesiologists in predicting the risk and think about the remedial approaches to prevent the future consequences. The hard dealing with the advancement of a uniform categorization of patient safety has hindered the current advances in patient safety. This paper presents a prediction system to deal with difficulties in airway management using machine learning algorithms implemented in Python tools. This expert system aims to support the doctors in the case of prediction of difficult parameters of the patients associated with the airway management.},

  abstract={Classifying foetal health is a crucial responsibility in healthcare, and innovative machine learning techniques can be utilised to help. In this instance, K-nearest neighbour, Nave Bayes, and Decision Tree classifiers are used to fine-tune an input picture dataset. The adjustment is done on these classifiers using methods like feature selection, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tweaking. Through the identification of the ideal parameters and feature combinations for your dataset, these strategies assist in improving the performance of the classifiers. To enhance the sustainable effectiveness of the classifier, you may also think about pre-processing methods like normalisation or dimensionality reduction. For the categorization of foetal health in this solution, three models are used and compared, with K-Nearest Neighbours, Naive Bayes classifier, and Decision Tree classifier showing 90%, 84.5%, and 93% accuracy, respectively when machine learning optimization techniques are applied using pre-trained model.},

  year={2013},

  pages={672-687},
  abstract={The web is perceived as a new social platform. Very often, the users look at the web as a place where they can find an individual or group of people with the same or similar interests, or even find new friends. Such situation is reflected in one of the aspects of the web 2.0 called tagging. Tagging is a process of labeling (annotating) digital items-resources-by users. The labels-tags-assigned to those resources reflect users' ways of seeing, categorizing, and perceiving particular items. In general, a single user can label a number of items with a number of different tags. The results of this activity-labeled items and used tags-can be perceived as information characterizing the user. This paper describes an approach for constructing a user signature representing her interests and opinions based on used items and tags. The signature is determined as a fuzzy relation built on two fuzzy sets proposed here: a fuzzy set representing resource attractiveness, and a fuzzy set representing tag popularity. Furthermore, users' signatures are used to determine similarity between users, and potentially give users a method to find new web friends with similar interests and opinions. The paper also describes a process of building different signatures representing a group of users. Signatures of users that are members of the group are aggregated using OWA operator and different linguistic quantifiers to describe the group in a number of ways. A real-world case study illustrating the process of finding similar users and/or groups of users is included.},

  abstract={Analytic hierarchy process (AHP), as one of the most important methods to tackle multiple criteria decision-making problems, has achieved much success over the past several decades. Given that linguistic expressions are much closer than numerical values or single linguistic terms to a human way of thinking and cognition, this paper investigates the AHP with comparative linguistic expressions. After providing the snapshot of classical AHP and its fuzzy extensions, we propose the framework of hesitant fuzzy linguistic AHP, which shows how to yield a decision for qualitative decision-making problems with complex linguistic expressions. First, the comparative linguistic expressions over criteria or alternatives are transformed into hesitant fuzzy linguistic elements and then the hesitant fuzzy linguistic preference relations (HFLPRs) are constructed. Considering that HFLPRs may be inconsistent, we conduct consistency checking and improving processes after obtaining priorities from the HFLPRs based on a linear programming method. Regarding the consistency-improving process, we develop a new way to establish a perfectly consistent HFLPR. The procedure of the hesitant fuzzy linguistic AHP is given in stepwise. Finally, a numerical example concerning the used-car management in a lemon market is given to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed hesitant fuzzy linguistic AHP method.},

  abstract={Self-assembling DNA complexes have been intensively studied in recent years aiming to achieve bottom-up construction of nanoscale objects. Among them a DNA complex called the DNA tile is known for its high programmability. DNA tiles can form 2-D crystals with programmable patterns via self-assembly. In order to create a wide range of complex objects by algorithmic self-assembly, we need a methodology to predict its behavior. To estimate the behavior, we can use thermodynamic simulations based on the Monte Carlo method. However, the previous simulation model assumed some simplified conditions and was not able to adequately explain the results of crystal growth experiments. Here, we propose the realistic tile assembly model, in which we are able to simulate the detailed conditions of the experimental protocols. By this model, the results of experiments (e.g., error rates, growth rate, and the formation and melting temperatures) are reproduced with high reliability. We think this model is useful to predict the behavior of DNA self-assembly and to design various types of DNA complexes.},

Moreover, there is an influence between marginal distribution distance and conditional distribution distance. However, joint domain adaptation approaches rarely consider those. Existing dynamic distribution alignment methods require a feature discriminator, and they need to train a subdomain discriminator for each class. Besides, they don't think about the interaction between the two distribution distances. In this article, we propose a dynamic joint domain adaptation approach, namely Joint Domain Adaptation Based on Adversarial Dynamic Parameter Learning (ADPL), to deal with the above problems. Both marginal distribution alignment and conditional distribution alignment can be implemented by adversarial learning. The dynamic algorithm can keep a balance between marginal and conditional distribution alignment with only two domain discriminators. In addition, the dynamic algorithm takes the influence between the two distribution distances into consideration. Compared with several advanced domain adaptation methods on both text and image datasets, all classification experiments and extensive comparison experiments demonstrate that ADPL has higher learning performance of classification and less running time. This reveals that ADPL outperforms the state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.},

  abstract={Since its inception, DNA computing has advanced to offer an extremely powerful, energy-efficient emerging technology for solving hard computational problems with its inherent massive parallelism and extremely high data density. This would be much more powerful and general purpose when combined with other existing well-known algorithmic solutions that exist for conventional computing architectures using a suitable ALU. Thus, a specifically designed DNA Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) that can address operations suitable for both domains can mitigate the gap between these two. An ALU must be able to perform all possible logic operations, including NOT, OR, AND, XOR, NOR, NAND, and XNOR; compare, shift etc., integer and floating point arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). In this paper, design of an ALU has been proposed using sticker-based DNA model with experimental feasibility analysis. Novelties of this paper may be in manifold. First, the integer arithmetic operations performed here are 2s complement arithmetic, and the floating point operations follow the IEEE 754 floating point format, resembling closely to a conventional ALU. Also, the output of each operation can be reused for any next operation. So any algorithm or program logic that users can think of can be implemented directly on the DNA computer without any modification. Second, once the basic operations of sticker model can be automated, the implementations proposed in this paper become highly suitable to design a fully automated ALU. Third, proposed approaches are easy to implement. Finally, these approaches can work on sufficiently large binary numbers.},

  abstract={In this paper, first, relationship between bipolar-valued fuzzy set and fuzzy set with its extensions is discussed. Second, a new order relation about bipolar-valued fuzzy sets is introduced. Contrary to the existing YinYang order relation about bipolar-valued fuzzy sets, which focuses on the “equilibrium” monotonicity, the new proposed order relation is concerned with “preference” monotonicity. And then, some new operations and related properties about the new defined order relation are presented. Third, by combining bipolar-valued fuzzy set with the rough set theory, the concept of the bipolar-valued rough fuzzy set is developed, which is the first attempt to consider inconsistent bipolarity into rough set theory. Particularly, by introducing two new operations to the rough set theory, the widely existing information losing problem in the computation process is solved. Furthermore, parameter-related and parameter-free rough degrees about the bipolar-valued fuzzy sets in a crisp approximation space are introduced. Finally, the bipolar-valued fuzzy decision information system is given; then, both the attribute reduction method and the knowledge discovery method based on the proposed roughness degree are presented. An example is included to show the feasibility and potential of the obtained theoretical results.},

  abstract={This brief describes neural modeling fields (NMFs) for object perception, a bio-inspired paradigm. We discuss previous difficulties in object perception algorithms encountered since the 1950s, and describe how NMF overcomes these difficulties. NMF mechanisms are compared to recent experimental neuroimaging observations, which have demonstrated that initial top-down signals are vague and during perception they evolve into crisp representations matching the bottom-up signals from observed objects. Neural and mathematical mechanisms are described and future research directions outlined.},
