  abstract={Although recent approaches to combine machine learning (ML) enhanced models and adaptive model selections using the built models became popular in many areas, however, there could be crucial pitfalls of built models in terms of 1) feature extraction and importance, 2) unbalanced datasets and 3) different types of ML estimators. In this case study using the ImageNet dataset, we thoroughly investigate the effects and possible pitfalls of features, datasets, and ML estimators for adaptive model selection of CNN inference network models targeting embedded systems. Based on the comprehensive results and analysis, we summarize opportunistic alternatives to minimize the pitfalls in the model building phase using more accurate feature extraction algorithms, various datasets in balance and size, and different types of interpretable (explaining important features) and black-box models.},

  abstract={We propose a new algorithm for the online supervisory control of partially observed discrete event systems. This algorithm is a parallel/distributed version of the online algorithm VLP-PO that we proposed in prior work. The situation under consideration in this paper is that of a system whose structure can be expressed as the shuffle of three state machines G/sub 1/, G/sub 12/, and G/sub 2/ (with disjoint event sets), where G/sub 12/ is to be interpreted as a common interface between the two system components G/sub 1/ and G/sub 2/. The legal language, denoted K, is global, but it can also be expressed as the parallel composition of two languages, K/sup 1//spl par/K/sup 2/, where K/sup i//spl sube/L(G/sub i//spl par/G/sub 12/), i=1,2. There are two communicating agents that simultaneously run (online) identical versions of the algorithm but on different models and legal languages: agent i, i=1, 2, operates on subsystem G/sub i//spl par/G/sub 12/ and legal language K/sup i/. We show that this scheme achieves the same behavior as the sequential VLP-PO algorithm, but at a total execution complexity that is significantly lower; this algorithm generates maximal observable and controllable sublanguages of the given legal language K.<>},

  abstract={Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a key resource for the study of brain function, and the interaction between computer and machine through EEG has become a new computer interaction mode. This project intends to study the EEG - computer interaction model based on facial expression. A neural cluster model based on neural network was used to model the mechanism of facial emotions-induced EEG. The EEG activity induced by facial emotion and its spectral characteristics were obtained. In order to improve the recognition accuracy of emotion-driven EEG, the analysis and recognition algorithm of EEG stimulated by expression is studied by combining wavelet with ANN model. The simulation results show that the correct rate of EEG recognition based on neural network is 88.69%. The recognition accuracy of BP neural network is 76.3%, and its convergence speed is also improved. The experimental results show that this method is an effective method for EEG recognition.},

  abstract={Trying to be effective (no matter who exactly and in what field) a person face the problem which inevitably destroys all our attempts to easily get to a desired goal. The problem is the existence of some insuperable barriers for our mind, another words barriers for principles of thinking. They are our clue and main reason for research. Here we investigate these barriers and their features exposing the nature of mental process. We start from special structures which reflect the ways to define relations between objects. Then we came to realizing about what is the material our mind uses to build thoughts, to make conclusions, to understand, to form reasoning, etc. This can be called a mental dynamics. After this the nature of mental barriers on the required level of abstraction as well as the ways to pass through them became clear. We begin to understand why thinking flows in such a way, with such specifics and with such limitations we can observe in reality. This can help us to be more optimal. At the final step we start to understand, what mathematical models can be applied to such a picture. We start to express our thoughts in a language of mathematics, developing an apparatus for our Spatial Theory of Mind, suitable to represent processes and infrastructure of thinking. We use abstract algebra and stay invariant in relation to the nature of objects.},

  abstract={In the competitive economy of the 21st century, innovation and the attitude to innovation are key factors. The depletion of traditional natural resources in today’s fast-changing world has virtually eliminated the former engine of economic growth, and a new approach is needed to enable economic actors to cope with the new environment. New solutions are the only way to overcome the anomaly of natural resources. It is essential that all economic actors, from micro to large enterprises, can play their part in this process. It is therefore of the utmost importance that the conditions are created in the near future to promote and stimulate innovation. The aim of this study is to present the Hungarian SME sector’s view on the factors that stimulate innovation, assessing the potential characteristics that can contribute to these processes and behaviours.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a method for better communication between collaborating engineers and between engineer and entity generation processes at the definition of products in modeling systems. The authors recognized the importance of correct human-computer- human communication by using of product model as a special medium for engineers. In order to establish a product model that is appropriate for this purpose, they integrated all influencing effects on a product in an influencing space. In order to record content of influencing by engineers and other influencing persons, authorities, etc., the currently prevailing information based product model is completed by representation of information content. This paper emphasizes some relevant issues of information content. Definition of this contents starts from modeling of human intent. Intent model is consists of information about the owner of an intent, characteristics of that intent, and representation of content of intent in some form of knowledge. Information content is organized in the interconnected intent, behavior, and decision spaces. In a hierarchical system, intent space is at the highest and decision space is at the lowest level hierarchy assuring human intent based automation of decision making on engineering object in an improved product model.},

  abstract={Advanced engineering applies model space for the development complete and consistent description of product objects and structures. Description of parts and units of products have been completed by related objects such as results of analyses, interacting humans, equipment control programs, rules, and so on. Humans define these objects by using of contextual connections. Considering current product modeling, the next step of development is application of achievements from the area of intelligent computing at the definition of engineering objects in product models. This paper introduces a method for the application of knowledge based decision making in order to replace the conventional direct definition of engineering objects in model based product development. The authors developed a new modeling method on the basis of their earlier proposed concept of information content. In this paper, they introduce this modeling method and detail its application in the form of an extension to the classical model space that is suitable for control of engineering object definition through a contextual chain starting from influencing humans.},

Various methods are examined, and those that yield precise answers and justifications while fostering creativity and imagination to enhance creative writing are identified. Techniques such as definition, elenchus, dialectic, maieutics, generalization, and counterfactual reasoning are discussed for their application in engineering prompt templates and their connections to inductive, deductive, and abductive reasoning. Through examples, the effectiveness of these dialogue and reasoning methods is demonstrated. An interesting observation is made that when the task's goal and user intent are conveyed to GPT-3 via ChatGPT before the start of a dialogue, the large language model seems to connect to the external context expressed in the intent and perform more effectively.},

  pages={455-463},
  abstract={Simulating real-world experiences in a safe environment has made virtual human medical simulations a common use case for research and interpersonal communication training. Despite the benefits virtual human medical simulations provide, previous work suggests that users struggle to notice when virtual humans make potentially life-threatening verbal communication mistakes inside virtual human medical simulations. In this work, we performed a 2x2 mixed design user study that had learners (n = 80) attempt to identify verbal communication mistakes made by a virtual human acting as a nurse in a virtual desktop environment. A virtual desktop environment was used instead of a head-mounted virtual reality environment due to Covid-19 limitations. The virtual desktop environment experience allowed us to explore how frequently learners identify verbal communication mistakes in virtual human medical simulations and how perceptions of credibility, reliability, and trustworthiness in the virtual human affect learner error recognition rates. We found that learners struggle to identify infrequent virtual human verbal communication mistakes. Additionally, learners with lower initial trustworthiness ratings are more likely to overlook potentially life-threatening mistakes, and virtual human mistakes temporarily lower learner credibility, reliability, and trustworthiness ratings of virtual humans. From these findings, we provide insights on improving virtual human medical simulation design. Developers can use these insights to design virtual simulations for error identification training using virtual humans.},

  abstract={In programming education, the instructor tries to find out the learners who needs help by grasping the learners’ development of understanding using tests that require knowledge. However, in reality, not many learners will acquire the skill of writing source codes. This kind of current situation implies that programming ability of learners cannot be measured by tests that require knowledge. This paper focuses on not only the knowledge items required for programming but also the programming thinking (computational thinking), which is the ability to combine the constituent elements of the program. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the learner’s understanding from the learner’s process to solve the code puzzles that require programming thinking as well as knowledge. We developed the interface to realize the proposed method. The experimental result with the interface showed that the proposed method could estimate with the accuracy of 80% or more.},

  abstract={According to Henry Jenkins, Transmedia storytelling is defined as "Transmedia storytelling (TMS) represents a process where integral elements of a fiction get dispersed systematically across multiple delivery channels for the purpose of creating a unified and coordinated entertainment experience. Ideally, each medium makes its own unique contribution to the unfolding of the story." (Jenkins 2007) In recent years, this technique is becoming popular in Europe and America. A creator needs to combine "Flow of story" and "Story experience" at a stage of planning a TMS project. Also, it is hard to build an elaborate plan; the world view of the story, time base, and how to invite the audience to participate in the experience. In this study, we propose the method of visualizing a structure of the entire story with a possible tree-structure model assumed from content elements that users are thinking about when they start to work on a TMS project.},

  abstract={Arguably the grand goal of artificial intelligence research is to produce machines with general intelligence: the capacity to solve multiple problems, not just one. Artificial intelligence (AI) has investigated the general intelligence capacity of machines within the domain of games more than any other domain given the ideal properties of games for that purpose: controlled yet interesting and computationally hard problems. This line of research, however, has so far focused solely on one specific way of which intelligence can be applied to games: playing them. In this paper, we build on the general game-playing paradigm and expand it to cater for all core AI tasks within a game design process. That includes general player experience and behavior modeling, general non-player character behavior, general AI-assisted tools, general level generation and complete game generation. The new scope for general general game AI beyond game-playing broadens the applicability and capacity of AI algorithms and our understanding of intelligence as tested in a creative domain that interweaves problem solving, art, and engineering.},

  abstract={This paper presents a structural organization of declarative memories using a new model of spiking neurons. Using this model we propose a self-organizing mechanism to build episodic and semantic memories on the cognitive level. Neurons in this approach represent symbolic concepts that are stored and associated with each other based on the observed events in the environment. We demonstrate that the associative neuron and their synaptic connections yield memories that are capable to recognize sequences of events and therefore can be a foundation for episodic memories. We also demonstrate that semantic memories build using these neuron models are capable to store the knowledge and respond in a novel, creative way to input stimuli. The paper presents the developed associative neuron model, neural network organization that results from input sequences, and simulation results.},

  abstract={In this work, we present a line of research focus on the didactics of teaching and learning of Computer Science for primary school. Our approach combines the training of teachers in Computational Thinking with Unplugged activities (without the use of computer) and Plugged ones, involving programming of computers and other devices. As a first instance of training, we presents the design and implementation of the "Higher Level Teaching Specialization in Didactics of Computer Science", approved by the Educational Ministry of Santa Fe, Argentine. The objective of this specialization is that the primary teachers can appropriate of Computational Thinking skills and the potential of programming, to include them in their educational practices in a contextualized, interdisciplinary and inclusive way. As results, an opinion poll is presented on a first stage of this training, from which it is possible to extract positive opinions of the teachers regarding the contents and didactics of the specialization that they are carrying out.},

  title={Computer-based intelligent support for moderately Ill-structured problems},

  abstract={Problems are often categorized into two types: ill-structured and well-structured, in the context of education/learning, cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Then, from an educational viewpoint, ill-structured problems are further more important because they are useful to promote a learner to think about learning target deeply and to master computational or logical thinking skills, including metacognition. This paper proposes an additional characterization of problems by using two factors, (1) well/ill-structured domain model and (2) well/ill-structured problem setting. Based on this characterization, “moderately ill-structured problems” are defined as a category of problems specified by “well-structured domain model” and “ill-structured problem setting”. If a problem is set in well-structured domain model, it is possible to realize computer-based monitoring and diagnosis of learner's activities for the problem. If the problem setting is ill-structured, for example, open-ended, a learner is required to engage in the problem as ill-structured one. Therefore, moderately ill-structured problems are promising to realize computer-based intelligent support for solving ill-structured problems, while keeping educational advantages of ill-structured problems. In this paper, a definition of moderately ill-structured problems is described. Then, using the arithmetic word problems as an example of learning target domains, this paper describes (1) well-structured domain model of arithmetic word problems, and (2) design of moderately ill-structured problem as “problem-posing assignment” based on the domain model. Moreover, (3) implementation of an intelligent learning environment that requests a learner to solve ill-structured problems as problem-posing is introduced. The environment has functions to diagnose learner's behaviors and to give individual feedback.},

  abstract={Digital technology, tools, and application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been an emerging trend in the design industry for the past two decades. AI is one of the latest computational technology that can mimic human intelligence and is dominating the IT industry at present. A lot of intelligent minds have connected to creating and building more smart and efficient ways of working and distributing creativeness along with the designers and their clients. They are generating the benefits such as design iterations, application of materials and their visualization, optimization of consumed time on projects, and management of information and resources. The area wherein the consumer benefits are within the product or material availabilities, and the reality of their visual perception and personalization within any space. It creates ample ideas based on personal needs and functions. This process consumes less time and makes way for better precision in the construction process with the compatibility of the tools and applications with the production mechanisms. The project working happening beyond 2 dimensions & 3 dimensions with 5D & 6D as in BIM working on multi-dimensional function with real-time extraction of information demonstrating changes in appearance, cost, and work scheduling. Being such a complex phenomenon, these need to be continuously studied as per contextual demands. This study is an assessment and analysis of the utility of these applications in built spaces by different stakeholders and changes in the design-build delivery process. These can benefit and profit designers in ways that can make their work efficient and expand their prolific enhancements in interiors that everyone can use for future studies in the longer run.},
