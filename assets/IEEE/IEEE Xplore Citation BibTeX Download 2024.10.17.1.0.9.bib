  abstract={Optimization framework of digital online model for vocal music training based on computer data perception and fusion is studied in the paper. Usually, the training in pattern recognition refers to statistical learning, that is, it requires a large number of training examples to obtain the estimated values of the parameters in the model, while the high-level voice semantic training is based on example learning. With the mentioned models, the signal fusion ideas are considered. With the development of general communication technology, audio AGC technology has also developed from analog circuits to the era of the digital signal processing. With these ideas, the digital online model for vocal music training will be then considered as the novel understanding model. Through the simulation, the framework of digital online model for vocal music training is tested and validated.},

  abstract={Forecasting model is a systematical tool to improve the performance of the demand forecasting in supply chain. With the incessant innovation of technology, new products have been developed continuously. Therefore, improving the forecasting accuracy of the new product has become a primary concern for many companies. Most of them in SCM care how to predict the new products sales in the future. Bass model was usually used to obtain the trend of the new product forecast by many reach in the past. Case-based Reasoning (CBR) is a method which can consider the past case to transform the useful historical experience into the case at present. To address this concern, we developed a demand forecasting methodology that combines CBR and common forecasting model. In the first stage, we use Bass model to obtain the new product sales forecasts. In the second stage, we obtain second forecast using CBR inference method to find the most similar curve in the past series. The final stage, we combine the forecast from Bass and CBR to development the hybrid forecast. Several cases are used to demonstrate the hybrid model how to improve the performance of new product forecast. The results show that the proposed hybrid model can effectively improve the accuracy of new product forecast.},

  abstract={Due to the fast development in computer science new modules and specializations have to be developed, and the Computer Science (CS) curriculum needs to be reshaped in order to include 21st century skills such as problem-solving, creativity, innovation, communication and collaboration. This paper proposes a generic model for designing learning experiences for CS curriculum. The model builds on existing credit systems such as European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS), to determine if a CS programme can be reshaped to a given period of time. Furthermore the model is capable of determining the student workload distribution across the different types of learning activities for a module. The distribution is computed based on information such as the number of credits for the module, the number of weeks in a semester, as well as the percentage hours of lectures, labs, independent study and other learning activities. Preliminary data collection and analysis was conducted in order to determine the percentages on 75 computer science modules taught at 14 universities from Ireland and UK.},

  abstract={There are a growing number of modeling techniques and algorithms for creating and modifying tree structures, both quickly and realistically. Many of these tools are part of larger software packages used for architecture or landscaping designs. In these tools the tree models are static and come from a library selection. In other areas, such as 3D modeling and design in film and animation, the tree creation tools are more open for artistic creativity and freedom of control. Much research has also been done on growing trees that are sensitive to some environment. That is, growing tree models where genus type, and natural and artificial environment factors are taken into heavy consideration. In this paper, we present an approach that facilitates user creativity while still providing a realistic response to environment factors. Our system adapts the Space Colonization Tree Modeling approach to allow for continued branch addition as well as environmental interaction. Feedback from experienced modelers who participated in a user study revealed that our approach generated the tree skeleton structures they intended and also provided realistic interaction with the environment.},

  abstract={In this study, we aimed to address issues related to students' slow writing skills by incorporating the “Out of Eden Walk” project using an AI model. Employing a project-based learning approach, our goal was to enhance students' writing abilities, particularly in the English subject. The research was conducted as a part of the classroom term-end assessment, following the model established by Nazarbayev Intellectual School of Chemistry and Biology, involving 42 students from Class 11. We utilized a qualitative descriptive method, employing both test and non-test instruments, including observation and data analysis in six cycles. The initial student completion rate was only 11.42%, while the experimental group showed a significant improvement to 85.71% by the end of the study. National Geographic's Out of Eden Walk, led by two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Paul Salopek, serves as an exemplary illustration of slow journalism. Over a seven-year, around-the-world journey, this article explores how Salopek's Walk not only embodies the essence of slow journalism but also significantly contributed to enhancing students' writing skills through the integration of an AI model.},

  abstract={Multimodal emotion recognition aims to recognize emotions through modal features such as acoustic, text, and visual modalities. Although existing multimodal emotion recognition algorithms have achieved good performance, in many tasks, features are extracted from the same video for acoustic, text, and visual modalities, which will lead to redundant information across modalities. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a multidimensional orthogonal fusion module, which orthogonalizes the input feature vectors to obtain pairwise orthogonal vectors, and concatenates the base vectors with the obtained orthogonal vectors to form fusion vectors. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms mainstream multimodal emotion recognition algorithms. Ablation experiments show that the input sequence of modality affects the model's performance, with the model achieving optimal performance when the input sequence is visual features, speech features, text features, and personality features.},

  abstract={The paper analyzes the construction condition and influencing factors of the concrete dam, and then constructs a block election model, which uses object-oriented simulation methods to model the construction of concrete dams. On the foundation of the preliminary research, a simulation and decision support system for concrete dam construction based on object-oriented is established to support decision-making.},

  abstract={This paper presents a case study based on the experience of implementing a blended learning (BL) approach by SPOC to a Computer General course for all the first year undergraduates in China University of Geosciences (Beijing). It introduces ubiquitous learning environment (ULE), teaching preparation for student-centered learning, and teaching practice of the BL. The study shows that BL approach has a positive effect on enhancing students' engagement and perception.},
