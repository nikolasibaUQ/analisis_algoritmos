  pages={01-05},
  abstract={We ran the first Affective Movement Recognition (AffectMove) challenge that brings together datasets of affective bodily behaviour across different real-life applications to foster work in this area. Research on automatic detection of naturalistic affective body expressions is still lagging behind detection based on other modalities whereas movement behaviour modelling is a very interesting and very relevant research problem for the affective computing community. The AffectMove challenge aimed to take advantage of existing body movement datasets to address key research problems of automatic recognition of naturalistic and complex affective behaviour from this type of data. Participating teams competed to solve at least one of three tasks based on datasets of different sensors types and real-life problems: multimodal EmoPain dataset for chronic pain physical rehabilitation context, weDraw-l Movement dataset for maths problem solving settings, and multimodal Unige-Maastricht Dance dataset. To foster work across datasets, we also challenged participants to take advantage of the data across datasets to improve performances and also test the generalization of their approach across different applications.},

  title={Developing smart device friendly asymmetric simulations for teaching collaborative scientific inquiry}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={130-131},
  abstract={Collaboration is an important feature of scientific practice. Scientists share, discuss and critically argue over different representations of a problem with others when attempting to generate new knowledge. Similarly, collaboration can be beneficial for inquiry-based science learning at school. Successful collaborative learning, however, relies on engaging students in a condition of positive interdependence. In this paper we propose that asymmetric simulations provide an innovative way to establish positive interdependence among students during inquiry learning which will foster the development of their collaboration skills. Asymmetric simulations divide some information or resources necessary to solve a problem unevenly among group members, thereby requiring more equal participation and contribution among all members during collaboration. The asymmetric simulations we developed are available online for free via the Go-Lab portal (golabz.eu) and therefore can be easily integrated into a digital lesson by school teachers. They were created taking into account the small screen sizes of smart devices such as smartphones or tablets, thereby making them convenient for collaborative work in school classrooms.},

  pages={88-92},
  abstract={In today's world with ever increasing amount of text assets overloaded on web with digitized libraries, sorting out these documents got developed into a feasible need. Document clustering is an important procedure which consequently sorts out huge number of articles into a modest number of balanced gatherings. Document clustering is making groups of similar documents into number of clusters such that documents within the same group with high similarity values among one another and dissimilar to documents from other clusters. Common applications of document Clustering includes grouping similar news articles, analysis of customer feedback, text mining, duplicate content detection, finding similar documents, search optimization and many more. This lead to utilization of these documents for finding required information in a competent and efficient manner. Document clustering required a measurement for evaluating how surprising two given information are. This dissimilarity is often estimated by using some distance measures, for example, Cosine Similarity, Euclidean distance, etc. In our work, we evaluated and analyzed how effective these measures are in partitioned clustering for text document datasets. In our experiments we have used standard K-means algorithm and our results details on six text documents datasets and five most commonly used distance or similarity measures in text clustering.},

  abstract={Human brain is a vital organ in the human body which has more than 100 billion nerves. They communicate through synapses. Few important things governed by brain are memory, emotions, creativity, intelligence etc. The human mind has three fundamental functions like figure out, react and relish. These functions of the mind are guided by one native egocentrism or potential rational capacities. Egocentric inclination happens involuntarily. ASD better termed as developmental delays. It can cause challenges in social interaction, behaviour and communication. Diagnosis of Autism includes both psychological and neurological examination. Early detection of the neurological markers with the help of MRI can help in to more accurate diagnosis. A combination of S-MRI (Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging), fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and Rs-fMRI (Resting State- Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) can help in learning all characteristics of brain. Full brain connectivity and signal intensities of Region of Interest can be acquired using various atlases. ASD destroys the structure of the functional connectivity between the multiple brain regions. Deep learning methods proves to be successful in classification of imaging data. Provided with multi modal details provided by different MRI procedures, using a deep learning network can provide accurate classification results. Graph Convolutional Neural Networks can help in classifying whether the person has ASD or not. Given a FC matrix of the brain it is really huge to differentiate the significant features. Thus, it is requiring for dimensionality reduction. So, the purpose of using deep learning model using MRI is to identify Autism in early stage and to start with therapies.},

  year={2021},
  volume={},

  pages={324-327},
  abstract={At present, group cooperative learning has received widespread attention as an important mode of independent and inquiry learning. However, during the implementation process, many students were not clear about their learning goals and did not like to discuss research with their classmates. It leads to learning to stay on the surface of formality. In order to solve the above problems and improve the effect of group cooperative learning, many researchers have conducted extensive explorations from the perspective of tools and strategies. Among them, the knowledge graph can visualize the relationship between knowledge points. It characterizes the changes in students' cognitive status during the learning process, guides learners to construct knowledge autonomously, and provides the possibility to solve problems such as the confusion of knowledge structure. At the same time, studies have shown that collaborative knowledge construction has a significant promotion effect on teachers' online learning, and is beneficial to teachers' professional development. Technologically supported collaborative knowledge construction can not only promote the efficiency of knowledge acquisition, but also enhance the effect of communication and interaction, and increase the degree of participation in learning. It is an effective method to enhance the depth and breadth of the interaction of students' learning. Therefore, this study combines the construction of knowledge graphs and group cooperative learning to create a group knowledge graph learning tool based on a group to explore its influence on learners' knowledge ability level and interactive characteristics.},

ELCS aims to provide teachers and high school learners with flexible-to-adopt, ease-of-use, from-concrete-to-abstract, and from-observation-to-experimentation digital materials on computer science concepts and to fulfill the High School Computer Curricula of Taiwan 2010. Various types of digital media, such as graphics, pictures, animations, simulations, instructional games, etc., were employed to implement four types of learning objects, including examples of concrete experiences, contexts for reflective observation, conceptual models for abstract conceptualization and contexts for active experimentation. A quality evaluation of content expert review revealed that the design of ELCS instructional simulations were appropriate for learning computer science concepts as measured from the perspective of technology acceptance. Further efforts were suggested to examine the effectiveness of types of instructional simulations for the target learners.},

  abstract={Because railway locomotives are complex and highly correlated with each other among its components, it is difficult to make Criticality evaluation by using traditional methods. In the present work, a criticality evaluation index model of the locomotive is established and the Monte Carlo simulation method is employed to obtain the criticality priority of the railway locomotive components. Based on the analysis and method, a program for general calculation is developed and applied to the criticality analysis on DF4D locomotive. The case showed that this method is an effective way to evaluate the criticality of the components of the railway locomotive. In addition, the new method of evaluation of criticality is more objective and suitable for practical situations since the analysis, for example, demonstrates that the equipment components with low failure rate have a high criticality priority. Furthermore, the method is convenient by employing Monte Carlo simulation. Therefore, this improved analysis method on the criticality analysis has a practical impact on making decision for the maintenance mode of complex equipment, i.e., railway locomotive.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Facial expression recognition (FER) is the key to understanding human emotions and feelings. It is an active area of research since human thoughts can be collected, processed, and used in customer satisfaction, politics, and medical domains. Automated FER systems had been developed and have been used to recognize humans' emotions but it has been a quite challenging problem in machine learning due to the high intra-class variation. The first models were using known methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Bayes classifier, Fuzzy Techniques, Feature Selection, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in their models but still, some limitations affect the accuracy critically such as subjectivity, occlusion, pose, low resolution, scale, illumination variation, etc. The ability of CNN boosts FER accuracy. Deep learning algorithms have emerged as the greatest way to produce the best results in FER in recent years. Various datasets were used to train, test, and validate the models. FER2013, CK+, JAFFE and FERG are some of the most popular datasets. To improve the accuracy of FER models, one dataset or a mix of datasets has been employed. Every dataset includes limitations and issues that have an impact on the model that is trained for it. As a solution to this problem, our state-of-the-art model based on deep learning architectures, particularly convolutional neural network architectures (CNN) with supportive techniques has been implemented. The proposed model achieved 93.7% accuracy with the combination of FER2013 and CK+ datasets for FER2013.},

This article uses computer technology-based reform of college physical education model, starting from two aspects of modern computer technology and college physical education, Chinaâs physical education courses are mostly completed outside of class, and modern teaching ignores the use of computer information technology to combine the current physical education, such education is not scientific. Computer information technology-assisted teaching is highly valued in Chinese universities and accepted by most physical education teachers, but the overall level of information technology software and application hardware development needs to be improved, such as the lack of computer-assisted teaching software and the practical application of multimedia-assisted teaching Factors such as poor results, imperfect hardware equipment, and insufficient quantities still restrict computer-assisted systems.

The current situation and limitations of technology and the limitations of the physical education model ways to analyze, discuss and summarize, so as to enrich the academic research results.},

  abstract={The ABET engineering criteria was first formulated and introduced to the American education system in the middle 1990s. The ABET accreditation system defines an engineering graduate according to Blooms Taxonomy. As a part of the continuing curriculum improvement at Bucknell University, a new junior-level design course has been recently introduced into the curriculum. The course title is ECEG 301: Praxis for Engineering Design. The objectives of this course are manifold, but is primarily designed to pave the way to improved student performance in senior design projects, promote team-work and hands-on experiences, and to enhance student completion of ABET outcomes, particularly criteria (c to h). Examples of the course contents include computer aided design (SolidworksÂ®), 3-D printing, design process elements, functional decomposition, fabrication, implementation, and simulation of photovoltaic systems. The course also aims at introducing students to crucial and current societal and environmental issues. In this paper, the results of the multiple projects are discussed. Based on anecdotal data analysis and feedback from students and faculty, the assigned projects have encouraged students' creativity and enhanced their ability to work on multidisciplinary teams. The inclusion of similar courses in undergraduate engineering curriculum would definitely improve students' hands on experiences and prepare them for more complex design challenges.},

  abstract={In this paper we propose a model of e-university, where teaching and learning processes are formalized. In this model we appeal to the following two types of games: reflexive games and computer-based problem-solving games. These games are used for seminars and assessments. Reflexive games play a crucial role in grouping courses into one curriculum. Hence, e-university is proposed to be organized by means of the so-called reflexive management.},

  abstract={Implementation of the new paradigm product lifecycle management (PLM) essentially changed work of engineers. At the same time, engineering with multidisciplinary products demanded PLM. PLM brought experience and expertise based knowledge driven product representation. It integrated huge amount information about product objects, processes, activities, analyses, methodologies, equipment, devices, and communications in active knowledge driven complex model. This model supposed advanced computer system. Currently, inherent characteristics of PLM modeling give new chance for higher education to turn towards case study and project based course programs while save theoretical content. In this paper, analysis and explanation of the new world of virtual engineering is introduced and discussed in order to conceptualize a future vision of higher education in engineering. Main contribution of this paper is practice oriented concept and model of course where theory and practice is harmonized in integrated teaching content using advanced PLM environment. Affect of PLM on curriculum is other main issue in this contribution.},

  abstract={The purpose of this paper is to analyze the integration of information and communication technologies in the education sector and identify the most promising barriers that affect the efficient implementation of these technologies in the education sector.For this study, various research papers were analysed and a survey was conducted to identify the barriers that affect the integration of information and communication technologies in the education sector. Interpretive Structured Modeling (ISM) methodology has been used in this work to level up the barriers to identify which among the identified barriers is the most and the least significant.The findings reveal that Limited Awareness is the most significant barrier to the implementation of ICTs in the education sector along with other barriers which include Poor Infrastructure, Budget, Lack of Experience, Privacy, Lack of Communication, Resistance to Change, Restricted Training on New Software, Management Issues and Complex to Implement.},
