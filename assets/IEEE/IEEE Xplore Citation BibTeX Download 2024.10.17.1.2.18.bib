  abstract={User-defined preferences in a natural style is useful in the pervasive computing environment, but bring a great challenge to understand. People often express conditional as well as independent preferences. We propose an ontology-based quantitative model for conditional preferences that aims to enhance the inference capacity of conditional preference statements and thus reduce users' workload. Different interpretations of the statements of our model are depicted and compared, including the inheritance property of the concept hierarchy in ontology, the connotation of sufficient and necessary conditions, and the bipolar property of preferences in human thinking. An experiment in the trip domain is conducted and shows the feasibility of our conditional preference model.},

  abstract={Educational institutions and education system play the important role in any society or country for development in all aspects like agriculture, industrial, economic and political. Teaching methodologies, learning preferences and techniques, socio-economics decide the student learning capabilities. Cognitive Learning (CL) is a kind of learning that is constructive, active, durable, and productive. It employs educates in the learning measures, encouraging them to think effectively to make connections when learning new things. In this paper, we want to demonstrate the student learning capabilities using their cognitive abilities. For this, we demeanor training and examines on different cognitive abilities and also collect the personal and other factors which impact student learning. In this process, we conduct training and examine the 313 engineering educates from AITAM Eng. College, A.P., India. We apply the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm for feature selection, and for prediction, use the ANN with back-propagation algorithm. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is constructed, as that the hidden layer of ANN neurons initially is two, after that we increment the neurons by one until reach good accurate results. The 5-neurons HL ANN is performed well as per performance parameters like accuracy (100%), AUC (1), R-value (1), recall, and precisions values.},

  abstract={In this project, we transferred Problem-Based Learning (PBL), a well-known pedagogy for medical education, to an online environment by transforming it into a simulation where students could practice their skills collaboratively in a risk-free setting. This paper describes the design of a conceptual model and development of a software platform to allow learners to collaborate online in discussing PBL cases. Early testing has been extremely promising, largely due to the extensive work done earlier to build the ENJEUX-S online game platform. Thanks to this work, it has been possible to extend this platform from online games to online simulations. Our first test of the PBL model with undergraduate students was successful in facilitating their critical thinking and was well-received. We are now planning to use COMPSoft in medical schools and to conduct comprehensive evaluation studies of both the model and the platform.},

  year={2017},
  volume={},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={In this paper we introduce a jigsaw-puzzle model to instill an entrepreneurial mindset in students. We then use our model to craft and add innovative lab assignments to “Digital Systems”, which is a core course taken by Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering and Computer Science students worldwide. In each lab assignment, students are provided with some components or puzzle pieces as well as the user guide of a digital system, and possibly some reading materials to better understand the operation theory of the system. One selling point of our model is its significant flexibility, so that the game may be played in different ways. Here is one example: students go over the user guide and the reading materials to get a solid understating of the underlying digital system. To comprehend what they have available, students also study the puzzle pieces. Then students challenge themselves to complete the puzzle and eventually build the digital system physically and test it. The resulting system is supposed to function in accordance with its user guide. Our work is an attempt to fulfill the Kern Entrepreneurial Engineering Network (KEEN) Students Outcomes. The anonymous survey from the students is encouraging and shows that our work is able to excite students' curiosity, provide them with an opportunity to apply creative thinking, and instill in students a feeling of value creation among other things.},

  abstract={As a vital risk to the public heath, suicide has been a hot topic for related research. Time perspectives (TPs) have attracted increasing attention in recent years in that making use of TPs can help gain insights into the real motives behind suicide ideation. TPs take into consideration how people think of or appraise their past, present, or future life would shape their behavior. Conventional TP-oriented studies on suicide tendency detection tend to rely on questionnaire surveys to help identify suicide thoughts or attempts. Such efforts suffer from weaknesses including low data collection efficiency and self-report bias. We proposed a TP-enhanced deep multitask model, TP-GloVe-GRU, in which TP is regarded as the synergy of both time and emotions. The model performance was evaluated against the CEASE dataset using a range of metrics. Results show that incorporating TP into the detection of suicide ideation leads to a better performance in most cases with an increase of 2.27% in the accuracy of suicide risk assessment.},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={This paper presents An Intelligent Agent Model for a Given Task in a Specified Environment. The methodology in this work is based on mixing algorithmic and function approaches to construct the intelligent agent model. The paper concentrates on building an intelligent agent model as a knowledge-based system interacting with dynamic environment to perform tasks. The class structure used to represent the environment in the knowledge base depends on three types of knowledge representation forms: production rule, semantic net, and frames. Each object in the environment is an instance of the class environment. Algorithms and functions are used for gaining knowledge from the state space of environment to build the task. The intelligent agent model can understand the environment from any position and can detect many subtasks, arrange them in a queue for execution, and has the ability to make a decision at a high level of thinking. The intelligent agent model is able to calculate the persistent changes in the external dynamic environment and any sudden change, such as observing the existence of any obstacle in the environment and avoiding it. The intelligent agent is also able to learn and take the reasonable decision in the dynamic environment and automatically select action based on task characteristics. Therefore, the intelligent agent can solve many different types of problems.},

  abstract={In a physicalist theory of mind, a concept is a mental representation, which the brain uses to denote a class of things in the world. They can help us classify newly encountered objects on the basis of our past experiences. But how can we get the concepts? As visual information account for about 80% of total perceptual information, this paper proposes a concept acquisition method based on visual cognition. Firstly, we give a new definition of concept based on the classic views. Then, we imitate the process of visual cognition to get the approximate locations of the salient proto-objects. By using the improved cerebral cortex learning algorithm, the concepts of the objects can be acquired. However, the whole model also has top-down process. The concepts learned in turn affect the former saliency-based region selection method. We demonstrate that the suggested method can not only yield dynamic and phase-smooth concepts, but also recognize objects with good precise. Our findings will facilitate further studies on human thinking.},

  abstract={First engineering and science formation units (blocks) of Tec21 competences-based model [1], defined by Tecnologico de Monterrey, include students solving a real challenge supported by knowledge obtained in modules on mathematics, physics, and computing. A new challenge "Design, construction and modeling of a water-powered rocket" was proposed for the F1007B "Modeling in Engineering with Conservation Laws" block. This challenge involves designing, modeling and construction of a rocket, powered by a jet of water due to the pressure of a hand pump. Students compete in teams to achieve the greatest distance with their rockets. The educational intention of this challenge is to enhance student learning experience by (1) Covering many more topics of Physics that can been applied by students (2) Improve students grades and professor evaluation, (3) Increasing the use of technology by incorporating the Tracker program for video analysis, (4) Enabling comparison of real results with those obtained through MATLAB modeling, and (5) Fostering enthusiasm among students by facilitating teams’ competition within the same class and even among different campuses. Considering the analysis made, it was observed that the water rocket contest helped most of the students to better understand the concepts of Physics included in this block and in the previous block, F1006B "Modeling the Movement in Engineering". The topics in this unit include the Principle of conservation of energy, the Principle of conservation of lineal momentum, Bernoulli’s Principle, Projectile motion and Air friction. A large percentage of students consider that this activity was good for using technological tools such as Matlab (72%) or Tracker (84%) and to compare theory with reality. A good number of students believe that this challenge helped them develop and implement solutions, demonstration of operation of engineering systems and devices, written language, and scientific thinking competences. It can be concluded that this rocket contest challenge is a good educational innovation since it incorporates a change in the materials, methods, contents and contexts involved in the formation unit.},

  abstract={Learners nowadays are susceptible to stress and boredom due to the prevalence of e-learning. Young adults form their personalities in the context of dynamic networks that heavily depend on technological advances. As a way to involve learners, game-based learning refers to the adoption of some gaming ideas and their adaptation to actual contexts. Computer and video games can give e-learners the opportunity to engage in educational strategies that emphasize practical immersion and are accompanied by frameworks that foster competence, professionalism, and creative thinking. Through this study, the authors explore the use of game-based learning in the higher education sector in India. The authors aim to understand e-learners’ perceptions regarding game-based learning especially as elearning is growing in popularity and to bring out the various factors that contribute to the success of game-based learning in higher education. Based on the study, the authors also propose a 6C Strategy Model highlighting various strategies that faculty members and educators can use. The model will enable faculty members to effectively utilize game-based learning to keep the e-learners motivated and engaged throughout the e-learning process.},

  abstract={In the higher education system, the introduction of information technologies is part of the modern unit of education. At the present time, when universities commonly use the form of distance and mixed education, this method places the student at the center of the entire educational system and among all other components related to this system. Supporting the development of skills, competencies, critical thinking, communication, and expressing ideas and concepts naturally, in a free form, stimulate the student. The motivation of individuals has a great influence on education and even on learning itself. These information technologies can implicitly greatly enhance motivation and also education through innovative teaching, learning, and assessment technologies. Motivation is increased through interactivity, dynamics, and effects provided by information technology. Virtual reality (VR) is the most interactive of these technologies. The contribution is devoted to the use of virtual reality in the educational process, where the basis of the use of virtual reality is the effort to display spatial models and scenes as faithfully as possible, their manipulation, the creation of the real world, a certain part of it with all its regularities and rules, movement in three-dimensional space and that all in real-time. In doing so, basic procedures from the field of computer graphics are used.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a method to distinguish distracted pedestrians from normal pedestrians, using the acceleration and the angular velocity while walking. This method uses an acceleration sensor attached on the back of the pedestrian. The acceleration and the angular velocity are obtained while the pedestrian is walking. In addition to that, walking features are calculated based on the obtained data. Some studies points out distraction of the pedestrian relates to consumption of working memory. We assume considering the relationship between consumption of working memory and walking behavior suggest the effectiveness to estimate distraction of the pedestrian. When each pedestrian is walking while consuming working memory, for example thinking about something, their walk deviates from normal. Machine Learning method, Random Forest, is applied to classify whether the pedestrian is distracted using features of walking. An experiment suggests we can distinguish walking features represent both distracted state and normal state completely. The result indicates the method can find distracted pedestrians whose working memory is highly consumed. We discuss why we can distinguish the distraction of the pedestrian from walking feature components with the variable importance. In addition, we have conducted regression analysis on the significant feature components to figure out the reasons. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of our proposed method.},

  year={2006},
  volume={},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={For many years, local circuit current through gap junctions has been seemed to be the main fundamental route for impulse transmission. In the last few years, some different evidences suggest another view on action potential propagation via myocardial cells. Some researches offered that myocardial cells may not require low-resistance connections for successful propagation of action potential. It seems that some other mechanisms are involved in the action potential propagation. Electrical field has been suggested as the main effective mechanism in action potential propagation. It is demonstrated that in the lack of gap junctions, electrical field is sufficient for action potential propagation. We simulated the mechanism of electrical field and local circuit current separately, studied the effect of these mechanisms on action potential propagation and compared them with each other. Our results demonstrate that although the mechanism of electrical field alters the resting potential of the post-junctional cell, but it is not sufficient to excite the post-junctional cell. These results offer a new view on action potential propagation in which both of the abovementioned mechanisms are necessary for normal cardiac functioning, but in different times of a cardiac cycle. It seems that gap junction has a dynamic behavior in each cardiac cycle, managing different routes of propagation in the diverse moments of normal cycle. Closure of gap junctions allows the negative cleft potential to develop and enhance the cell excitability by reducing cell potential. Then opening the gap junction produces AP. Based on this view, we think that most of the paradox about the role of gap junctions in cardiac impulse propagation will be solved},

Then, the analyzed frequency components of the EEG have that the frequency components in which characteristics are contained significantly, and that not. Moreover, these combinations have the human equation. We think that these combinations are the personal characteristics frequency components of the EEG. In this paper, the EEG analysis method by using the GA, the FA and the NN is proposed. The GA is used for selecting the personal characteristics frequency components. The FA is used for extracting the characteristic data of the EEG. The NN is used for estimating extracted the characteristics data of the EEG. Finally, in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed method, EEG pattern was classified using computer simulations. The EEG pattern has 4 conditions, which are listening to rock music, Schmaltzy Japanese ballad music, healing music and classical music. The result, in the case of not using the personal characteristics frequency components, gave over 95% accuracy. This result of our experiment shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Motor and gearbox are considered the main components in various machines related to its supplying power and transmitting motion role. Operating machines acquire vibration signal that are continuously monitoring by sensors placing close to vibration source. This for processing and identify the machine’ components status. Breakdown of the rotating machine causes significant losses and costs, so the analysis of its vibration signals proved literately avoiding these drawbacks with effective faults diagnosis. This paper proposing two models for gearbox and motor faults identification as an attempt towards finding the optimal performance: The first developed model is a fuzzy logic (FL) based model and the other is genetic algorithm (GA) based model. The intended output of both models reduce time and cost of maintenance. It also indirectly increases the machine component’s life. Additionally, the computational analysis proved that, concerning execution time and accuracy; and with the powerful straight forward representation for uncertainties offered by the Fuzzy Logic; it is indeed reliable, however it presented lower classification accuracy (96% for gear box faults and 93% for motor faults) and lower generalization schema. Yet, the proposed strategy which integrates GA and SVM recorded high performances in optimization and higher classification capabilities (97% for both gear box and motors faults). These factors illustrate the effectiveness and optimal performance of the genetic based model.},

  abstract={Media bias has been extensively studied by both social and computational sciences. However, current work still has a large reliance on human input and subjective assessment to label biases. This is especially true for cable news, which has a continued presence in American media but a lack of text-based bias identification in research. To address these issues, we develop an unsupervised machine learning method to characterize the bias of cable news programs without any human input. This method relies on the analysis of what topics are mentioned through Named Entity Recognition and how those topics are discussed through Stance Analysis in order to cluster programs with similar biases together. Applying our method to 2020 cable news transcripts, we find that cable news programs tend to cluster together consistently over time and roughly correspond to the cable news network of the program. This method reveals the potential for future tools to more objectively assess media bias and characterize unfamiliar media environments, and the empirical results insight into the nature of bias in American cable news programs.},

  abstract={We review some of the open issues in computational stereo. In particular, we will discuss the problem of extracting better matching primitives and of dealing with occlusions. Markov Random Field models - an extension of standard regularization - suggest sophisticated stereo matching algorithms. They are, however, ill-suited to efficient, real-time applications. We will conclude reviewing a new simple but fast algorithm implemented by one of us (Drumheller, 1986) on the TMC Connection Machine (TM) computer. Some of its features are: (a) the potential for combining different primitives, including color information; (b) the use of a stronger and new formulation of the uniqueness constraint; and (c) its disparity representation that maps efficiently into the architecture of the Connection Machine computer.},

  abstract={Architecture was perceived for many centuries as the design of static buildings that will last for extended periods of time, with static changes or additions at most. Traditional design tools reflect this approach. Kinetic architecture, however, defines a kind of architecture that incorporates dynamic properties which accommodate for environmental or utilization changes. The integration of mechanics, electronics, and computer technology into contemporary architectural design, requires a change of thinking and designing, as well as suitable design tools. To communicate design ideas, the architectural design process utilizes effective strategies such as sketching and model building. A well-established design technique in diverse disciplines is rapid prototyping. Our goal is to have an integrated environment for designing kinetic architecture, including its mechanical parts, electronic units, and software modules with a rapid prototyping approach. This paper discusses conceptual ideas for rapid prototyping design environments for kinetic architecture. An exemplary environment is introduced where a small design task has been realized to provide feedback for the concept.},

  title={How Various Educational Features Influence Programming Performance in Primary School Education},

  abstract={In the digital age, programming education has become increasingly important, even in primary schools. However, introducing programming at such an early stage presents unique challenges, given the need for students to grasp mathematical concepts, abstract thinking, and the intricacies of programming syntax. Educational Data Mining (EDM) offers a potential contribution by predicting learning performance, facilitating the optimization of the learning processes, and providing real-time guidance. A notable gap in the current literature about EDM in programming education is its predominant emphasis on the university level. Our research objectives were to identify features influencing primary school students' programming capabilities. A more comprehensive dataset was introduced, incorporating psychometric data and highlighting features such as learning motivation and attitude, computational thinking data, and other potentially influential variables, which set our study apart from previous studies. We found that the strongest predictor was academic performance in Information Technology, followed by psychometric data on students' learning attitudes and motivation. Computational thinking also emerged as a significant feature in predicting programming performance. It's worth highlighting that involvement in extra-curricular activities, like Olympic Mathematics training, showed a significant association, underscoring the importance of mathematical logic and reasoning in programming. This is further bolstered by the evident correlation with academic performance in Mathematics, confirming its pivotal role in shaping programming abilities. Interestingly, the correlation of academic performance in Chinese is also significant, indicating that the language medium of instruction can notably influence success.},
