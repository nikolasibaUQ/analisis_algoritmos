  abstract={As the community is now a days moving rapidly towards the cloud, its security is something we really need to think and research about. The problem of security is as old as the internet is, and hence a number of solutions for the problem has also been thought of. Many of the various solutions consists using firewalls for the network or in the host, anti-malware programs installed on the system, packet-sniffing techniques for detection of malicious entities as well as fake traffic, pattern and signature matching techniques for various files that the system has to deal with every now and then. One of these is solutions is deploying Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in the network. Here, we have devised a model that will be able to find any unwanted intrusions in the network. For this, we have employed Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the Whale Optimization Algorithm which we will see is an effective algorithm to use. In the first step, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is built using GA with natural selection method. The proposed hybrid algorithm in this scheme is then tested for the detection of malicious network traffic date set.},

  abstract={Today's era is of the digital images, what we think, imagined is created in the form of digital images. The forgery detection is technique which can detect the cloning from the images. The availability of different images, editing tools have made it easier for a common user to mislead the images and create digital fake images from it. The forgery detection has various techniques like active and passive techniques, moreover the properties like analysis, classification etc, are used to identify the forgery. The work presented in this paper is based on cloning forgery detection. The cloning forgery technique is one of the type of forgery detection techniques in which some area of the image is copied and moved to some another area of the same image which is not easy for the naked eyes to detect easily. The PCA (Principle Component Analysis) technique is used to find the mismatched pixels from the image. In the presented work, the GLCM (Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix) technique is applied with the PCA for the forgery detection. The proposed work is implemented in MATLAB and results are analyzed in terms of PSNR, Recall, Precision and accuracy. In the presented work, the results are better due to less fault rate or able to recover two different attacks (Gaussian noise and motion blur). It is analyzed that the proposed algorithm performs well as compared to the existing algorithm. In existing method the results of their parameters like accuracy were less accurate then proposed method. Moreover, the proposed method achieves more accuracy precession and recall.},

  abstract={When a car driver communicates with someone using a hands-free telephone, he has to do three extra tasks besides driving; to listen to and to understand the person whom he is talking to, to think of the answer, and to talk. The paper describes a research experiment in which an environment consisting of three tasks on a computer screen is used to analyze quantitatively the mutual effect of these tasks. The first is a tracking task, which is a typical skill-based one. The second is to recognize the visual information that is indicated by four different media on a computer screen and to respond as soon as possible. The third is to listen to a conversation and answer a question about it. In this paper we have examined the effect of third task on the first and the second tasks. There was no effect on the performance of the tracking task. The time needed to respond after getting the information was affected a little by the third task. The number of instances of overlooking the visual information in the second task was significantly increased by the effect of the third task. This point might be one of the causes that result in a car accident.},

  abstract={Web sites are most effective when they meet both the contents and usability needs of their users. Due to tremendous growth of web application, it increases the complexity of web applications and web navigation. Website design is easy task but, to navigate user efficiently is big challenge, one of the reason is user behavior is keep changing and web developer or designer not think according to user's behavior. Designing well-structured websites to facilitate effective user navigation patterns has long been a challenge in web usage mining with various applications like navigation prediction and improvement of website management. Different methods have been proposed to reorganize Web Pages to improve users navigation using users navigation data but it still causes disorienting users and increases user's cognitive load. There is a need to improve the efficiency and the performance of a website for effective user navigation. Through this Paper we will propose Mathematical programming model to improve user navigation while minimizing alteration to current structure. Optimal solution can be very quickly obtained. We are minimizing unnecessary changes to the present structure of a Web site and hence can be applied for Web site maintenance on a regular basis.},

  abstract={This paper aims to consider the changes in the international investment environment and bring high uncertainty to multinational enterprises. Therefore, multinational enterprises invest in overseas markets according to the degree of capital expenditure, and adopt progressive investment. The order of capital expenditure (low to high) is divided into four stages, the first stage of export or authorization, and the second stage of opening the franchise chain, the third stage of joint venture, the fourth stage of acquisition or the establishment of foreign branch. Under the uncertainty of investment cash flow and exchange rate changes, use the option to growth or option to abandon of binomial options evaluation method to predict the four-stage cash flow and exchange rate changes. In view of the four stages of multinational enterprises' orderly capital costs (low to high), each stage selects the best decision, uses the option to growth to invest capital or option to abandon to give up the investment. This paper constructs a dynamic and successive investment binomial options decision model, estimates the equity value of overseas investment of multinational enterprises, and conducts investment strategy feasibility assessment. And compare the traditional investment decision NPV method, providing managers with a more flexible decision-making thinking mode for multinational enterprise investment.},

  abstract={Main purpose of engineering is transfer of intent from different humans into product definition. Application of an integrated product model has a chance of establishment of highly efficient processes for product definition. Product modeling has reached a level where sophisticated representations of object data and relationships are available at every day engineering activities. This information based model is defined by the authors as classical product model. The problem is at the application of this model because information in it is a result of a complex human thinking process content of which is not communicated with the model from the decision maker to the engineer who applies or revises the model. In this paper, the authors introduce their approach and method for a product model that is suitable for better communication between human and processes at generation of classical product model. After a short introduction of related research works, the authors analyzed the changed role of knowledge in product definition. Following this, knowledge and human intent are discussed in order to establish human intent based knowledge representations in product model. In the rest of the paper, the authors introduce the concept of content of product information and propose a multilevel structure for integrated information and information content based product modeling. Finally, future research and implementation are outlined.},

The Selection of appropriate camera is depending upon the three primary color of object. There are mainly three characteristic of chrominance signal. Hue, Saturation & Luminance. Amplitude of chrominance signal defines Saturation level and Phase angle of the signal determines Hue. So Chrominance circle, with magnitude level contains all colours of the world. Model describes the magnitude level and phase angle for the particular colour. Two colour difference signals are modulated in Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) manner. So by using this model you can show that how the QAM waves are looks like for particular colour. As well as the model describes how PAL-D System, used in the Asian country, works and how it is superior then the NTSC system used in American Country. Thus the concept of, Colour Television Transmission is designed in an oversimplified way.},

  abstract={Current pandemic situation has a significant impact affecting human life not only socially and economically, but emotionally and psychologically as well. This impact can be easily observed on social media platforms. Along with the knowledge exchange related to Covid-19 pandemic on social media, there is an emotional trauma wave that can be felt by carefully analyzing the activities of this social media. Keeping this view in thought, we analyze around 12000 tweets of Indian people to find out whether there is a trend shift of thinking pattern and mindset of Indian people as the pandemic progresses. The study is bifurcated into stages to clearly see the paradigm shift. We use tweets since twitter is a rich medium that can be leveraged to its optimum to have a good amount of understanding of the sentiments of the people. Analyzing the twitter dataset, we derive results and find out whether the amount of negative tweets v/s positive (or motivational) tweets have increased or not as the pandemic progresses. The study is supported by graphical visualizations of the polarity of the tweets month wise. Further, Wordmap approach is used to perform qualitative mining analysis in addition to the sentiment score based calculation. This work helps us to understand how the public opinions are changing with the changes in the spread dynamics of the virus. This kind of mood mining helps in identifying the Covid-19 situation from the psychological perspective that whether there is a sense of fear among people or they are quite optimistic of the situation. It can help in a great extend to the strategic and decision making bodies to plan out for future decisions. Further, such kind of studies can be used as reference to provide insights about mental health of people for any future incident or event of such nature.},

  abstract={There are still many mysteries as to why humans can talk. Especially in birds there is something that can reproduce human's pronunciation. For monkeys as well, it is possible to perform human pronunciation functionally in terms of airway configuration. However, these animals do not have language features. In recent years, research and development of AI which gained a deep impression on deep learning and big data is prevalent. After learning sound, AI can recognize and utter a conversation. Monkeys can see things by eye, recognize them, and eat for food if it is food. AI can cause the robot to take similar actions. Given the mechanism of speech recognition, it is identified as a word unit, a phrase or a sentence by identification of sound, coding of maximum likelihood, and probabilistic syllable estimation using existing databases such as triphones. It can be thought that birds or monkeys can do this sound again through the articulation mechanism. However, it is impossible to freely extract words and phrases from learned sentences, create sentences with new meanings, and pronounce them. Here, I think that the boundary of presence or absence of language is the presence or absence of this function. I'm studying to predict the factors that language has in human beings from the dental field. In the dental field, various information such as the shape of teeth and jaws are accumulated historically and over time. Recent studies have shown that vowels can be pronounced like humans, not humans. However, it is my expectation that consonants, especially fricatives, that adjust the advanced sound with the tongue will probably be difficult. Even children, it is difficult to pronounce fricatives until about 6 years old. I have been conducting research using aerodynamic acoustic techniques to understand why it is difficult to acquire fricative sounds, so I will tell you about things that have been understood so far.},

Hence we acquire an important element for generating flexible logical operation models - N-generator integrity cluster, which is helpful to find the general rules of the definition of flexible NOT propositional connective in [0,∞) interval. These researches provide the important theoretical base for 1-level operation model in [0,∞) interval in flexible logics.},

  abstract={We discuss some aspects of a well known algorithm for inhomogeneity intensity correction in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), the parametric bias correction (PABIC) algorithm. In this approach, the intensity inhomogeneity is modelled by a linear combination of 2D or 3D Legengre polynomials (computed as outer products of 1D polynomials). The model parameter estimation process proposed in the original paper is similar to a (1+1) Evolution Strategy, with some small and subtle differences. In this paper we discuss some features of the algorithm elements, trying to uncover sources of undesired behaviors and the limits to its applicability. We study the energy function proposed in the original paper and its relation to the image formation model. We also discuss the original minimization algorithm behavior. We think that this detailed discussion is needed because of the high impact that the original paper had in the literature, leading to an implementation into the well known ITK library, which means that it has become a de facto standard.},

  abstract={T Fake drugs threatens medical supply chain frightfully over 124 countries in the world. Even in Japan, although nobody expected counterfeits violate the maintained distribution of this country, fake harvoni for hepatitis C sold at an authorized pharmacy shocked officials in Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Anti-counterfeit to prevent fake drugs requires rapid-authenticating, costless, and more than anythings, high-security technology. Recent advances in nanotechnology accelerate developments of nanotag identifiers. Thinking of rapidness and high security in authentication, surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) produced from well-designed noble metal nanostructure is promised to apply new authentication method. We have developed SERS active nanostructures by self-assembling of gold nanoparticles (AuNP) with Raman active reporting molecules. A few nanogram amounts of the AuNP assembles were directly deposited onto commercial tablet Mucodyne. For on-dose authentication outside of a laboratory, 80 g weight and smart-phone driven palm-top Raman detector was used. Shelf-life in SERS activity of the AuNP self-assemble liquid stocked at room temperature was over six months. The nanotag labeled Mucodyne tablet showed special SERS signal derived from the reporting molecule, and 0.2 s irradiation of 785 nm (5 mW) laser was enough to produce distinguishable SERS spectra from intact tablet. Excellent longevity of SERS signal over three years on the labeled tablets was confirmed. By just 0.2 second laser irradiation with a palmtop Raman spectrometer, rapid on-dose authentication was successfully achieved.},

  abstract={Television has been a part of our day to day life. So, sometimes we think how this system really works! In between Transmission and Reception, Information Signal passes through plenty of complex process and stages. We have Implemented, the process made on Chrominance signal (|C|) with the help of simulator, Lab VIEW 9, made by National Instruments in 1986. The Selection of appropriate camera is depending upon the three primary color of object. There are mainly three characteristic of chrominance signal. Hue, Saturation & Luminance. Amplitude of chrominance signal defines Saturation level and Phase angle of the signal determines Hue. So Chrominance circle, with magnitude level contains all colours of the world. Model describes the magnitude level and phase angle for the particular colour. Two colour difference signals are modulated in quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) manner. So by using this model you can show that how the QAM waves are looks like for particular colour. As well as the model describes how NTSC System, used in the Asian country, works and how it is different from the PAL-D system used in Asian Country. Thus the concept of, Colour Television Transmission is designed in an oversimplified way.},

  abstract={Nowadays the uses of electronic circuits, often the opposite trend are seen. To produce a hand are getting cheaper circuits, on the other hand becoming more reliable ones. The first distinction is certainly true in electronic circuits which are used in commercial application, even just thinking of cheap consumer electronics [1] [18] [13] [12] [17]. Another group of electronic circuits made for the high reliability use. This group includes a variety of medical, safety, military technology, aviation and aerospace applications. Reliability of these beyond, are often formulated as special needs, low weight, adaptivity, the reconfigurability, the circuit robustness [6] [4] [7]. In this article we test the different possibilities for such operations the creation of robust circuits, in particular the use of programmable analog circuits.},
