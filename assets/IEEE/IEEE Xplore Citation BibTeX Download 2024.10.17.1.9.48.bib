  abstract={Social media are increasingly popular, worldwide, and when social media technologies extend from the Western markets in which they were developed into the Eastern markets where they are now used, marketing strategies that support technology uses in new cultural contexts must be developed. To inform this process achieve this, social media researchers must learn new ways of thinking about technology in its cultural context. In a comparative study of the Southeast Asian social media markets of Vietnam and Singapore, we induce a grounded theory perspective of social media cultures, comparing across instances of both an emerging market and an advanced market in the hemispheric region. We find the Vietnamese culture of social media use orients around economic productivity, Social Commerce, leveraging social connections to generate consumer-to-consumer commerce largely outside of government notice and taxation. The Singaporean culture of social media revolves around the important and highly implicit notion of Influence Commerce. Singaporeans are experts in their application of social media presence to monetize the process of exerting social influence on networks of information and opinion. The Singaporean media use culture takes place with full knowledge and support of the relevant government Bureaus since most internally produced social media influence is political in nature and friendly to the ruling powers.},

In this paper we describe a novel mechanism that successfully endows NPCs in real-time games with strategic planning capabilities. Our approach creates adaptive behaviours that take into account long-term and short term consequences. Our approach is unique in that: (i) it is sufficiently fast to be used for hundreds of agents in real time; (ii) it is flexible in that it requires no previous knowledge of the playing field; and (iii) it allows customization of the agents in order to generate differentiated behaviours that derive from virtual personalities.},

  year={2024},
  volume={11},
  number={1},
  pages={1096-1107},
  abstract={Digital human in cyberspace can help provide humanized services in specific applications, such as question & answer systems, recommender systems, chatter robots, and intelligent assistants. While most researches focus on behavior analytics, few of them integrate the personality that is also a closely related factor. As a classic indicator for personality representation, Myers–Briggs type indicator (MBTI) categorizes an individual into mutually exclusive types from four dichotomous axes (extraversion versus introversion, sensing versus intuition, thinking versus feeling, judging versus perceiving). Traditional recognition method using MBTI simply measures the user’s preference frequency in each axis through questionnaires, treating the dominant value as the identified result. Such a paradigm, however, represents all the people with only 16 types and cannot distinguish heterogeneous users clearly. This article proposes a novel personality recognition method using fuzzy logic. Different from previous classifications, our new method categorizes the individual in a continuous space and represents one’s personality in a more fine-grained level. We have designed comparative psychological tests for 77 people. The validation experiments on such tests indicate that the fuzzy-logic-based method is not only consistent with the classic MBTI tests (in the sense of defuzzification) but also provides the uncertainty for each personality type. Therefore, it can be viewed as a generalization of the classic MBTI tests and promotes the representation of individual’s heterogeneity for fine-grained analytics of digital human.},

  abstract={Recently, the epidemic of COVID-19 infection broke out in Wuhan, China. To explore the pathological mechanism of pneumonia infected by coronavirus, we built a bioinformatics pipeline based on time-series gene co-expression network analysis to analyze the gene expression profile of lung cells in mice infected by SARS-Cov (GSE19137). In this study, Pearson correlation analysis was performed to construct a gene co-expression network. Time-ordered gene network modules were digged out by BFS algorithm. PageRank algorithm was used to explore HUB genes related to pneumonia infected by coronavirus. Based on the information we got, we think that cell lines infected by coronavirus might go through 5 stages, and 10 HUB genes(AKT1, CD68, CTSS, FCGR3A, HSPA8, PTPRC, UBC, VCP, PRPF31, ITPKB) might play a key role in coronavirus infection. This might provide some hints for coronavirus related research.},

  abstract={Every moment, millions of people worldwide are communicating and sharing content online. We express ourselves online to enrich existing relationships and establish new relationships that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to develop offline. Such actions are reflected in a corresponding set of digital social artifacts, such as blog posts, emails and status updates. We are accustomed to thinking of collections of digital artifacts online as repositories of information. What if we are now searching collections of digital social artifacts that reflect people's online relationships with one another and aspects of their lives? Are standard search methods sufficient? How do we want to query such data? We contend that general queries may have both informational and social components to them. We define social queries as queries about social attributes and behaviors that identify individuals, relationships or groups exhibiting such characteristics. To develop a deeper understanding of social query, we focus on the specific task of social relationship identification. In the context of two scenarios, we examine the challenges posed by the task, review an initial realization of social relationship identification and present a way forward to address the general task.},

  pages={69-74},
  abstract={Artificial Swarm Intelligence (ASI) is a hybrid AI technology that enables distributed human groups to "think together" in real-time systems modeled on natural swarms. Prior research has shown that by forming "human swarms," networked groups can substantially amplify their combined intelligence and produce significantly more accurate forecasts than traditional methods. The present study explores whether the rich behavioral data collected during "swarming" can be used to further increase the accuracy of swarm-based forecasts. To do this, a dense neural network was used to process the data collected during a set of swarm-based forecasts and generate a Conviction Index (CI) for each forecast that estimates its expected accuracy. This method was then tested in an authentic forecasting task – wagering on sporting events against the Vegas odds. Specifically, groups of sports fans, working as real-time swarms, were tasked with predicting the outcome of 238 NBA games over 25 consecutive weeks. As a baseline, the swarms achieved an impressive 25% net return on investment (ROI) against the Vegas Odds. This was compared to an enhanced method that used Conviction Index to (a) estimate the strength of each forecast and then (b) wager only on forecasts of sufficient strength. The CI-selected wagers yielded a 57% net ROI against Vegas Odds. This is a significant gain, equivalent to more than doubling the ROI of the naïve swarm betting strategy.},

  abstract={In artificial intelligence, knowledge acquisition and reasoning are the most basic key elements for intelligent agent to obtain the ability of the simulation thinking which capacitate intelligent agent to carry out a series of actions. At present, Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) has been a primary technique for modelling knowledge acquisition and reasoning. This is mainly due to the dynamic epistemic logic has a stronger expression ability to deal with many problems about agent's cognitive reasoning in computer science. In this paper, we distinguish the major sorts of knowledge that the cognitive agent will hold in their interaction in the beginning, and then establish a Knowledge Acquisition System (KAS) which is added a new operator of `knowledge acquisition' to extend the basic epistemic language for bi-agent interaction. Other than that, we prove the soundness and completeness of this system, and analyze some properties about it. By this system, it is clear to explain how the agent acquires knowledge that will be transformed into common knowledge by observing the other agent's speech act. The acquired knowledge is further transformed into new private knowledge that provides the strategy options in agent's mind in interaction.},

  abstract={Terrain coverage algorithms are quite common in the computer science literature and for a good reason: they are able to deal with a diverse set of problems we face. From Web crawling to automated harvesting, from spell checking to area reconnaissance by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), a good terrain coverage algorithm lies at the core of a successful approach to these and other problems. Despite the popularity of terrain coverage, none of the works in the field addresses the important issue of classification and evaluation of these algorithms. It is easy to think that all algorithms (since they are all called terrain coverage) deal with the same problem but this is a fallacy that this paper tries to correct. This paper presents a summary of many algorithms in the field, classifies them based on their goals, introduces metrics to evaluate them, and finally performs the evaluation.},

The following scenario is considered. Suppose that user Alice thinks that Bob might be a good new friend. So, Alice and the Online Social Network (representing Bob) engage in a two-party matching protocol. In this protocol no work from Bob is required, Bob can be offline. The matching protocol is designed to give Alice an indication if Bob is similar to her based on their profiles. We show that the process does so without revealing the private information of Alice and Bob to one another and to the Online Social Network.},

  abstract={Individual personality is a vital criterion in a human life as well as in a development of an organization. Every individual holds a different personality type with various characteristics in terms of thinking, feeling, and behaving. Due to that matter, analyzing human personality should be done carefully which can be challenging and time consuming. Therefore, this study presents a personality prediction model based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The prediction was realized on the Big Five personality model. The dataset consists of 709 rows and retrieved from open-source website called Kaggle. For training, validation and testing phases, the dataset was divided into 70:15:15 respectively. Findings of the study demonstrated the capability of ANN in producing better accuracy compared to three identified algorithms which includes Naïve Bayes, ZeroR and Random Forest.},

  abstract={The technological and online experiences of billions worldwide are dominated by a handful of companies known as “Big Tech.” Despite this being a cause for concern in governmental, economic, and ethical spheres, the literature lacks a study exploring the impact of public scandals on, and the global sentiment toward, Big Tech. Here, we quantify the power of Big Tech by analyzing their acquisitions, market capitalization, and number of monthly active users. Moreover, we utilize the synthetic control method to estimate the effect of public scandals on the stock price of two Big Tech companies, and find that they had no lasting effect. We also analyze the number of tweets mentioning these scandals, and find that they quickly fade from the spotlight. To explore public sentiment, we survey 5300 participants across 25 countries, and find that those from countries with lower digital literacy and more authoritarian regimes are more trusting of Big Tech. Furthermore, we find that one in three feels they lack control over the data collected about them, and one in four feels that Big Tech knows what they are thinking, knows more about them than their best friend, and may even be secretly listening to their conversations. Additionally, one in four feels addicted to Big Tech products, have no choice but to use them, and wishes there were more companies to choose from. These findings highlight the adverse effect of the oligopolistic nature of Big Tech on consumer choice and help inform policy-makers aiming to curb their dominance.},

  abstract={This paper presents a part of research into e-waste and e-cycling in Lebanon; it describes the status quo of today's governmental and NGO's actions, tools, and intentions about e-waste. The research questions answered throughout this paper are two: the first one wonders if the Lebanese society and government are aware of the e-waste hazards and whether there is any action taken, on the governmental level, to avert an environmental catastrophe. Whereas the second one is concerned with finding out, what Lebanese think about e-waste and whether they are willing to fight against it? Answers to the first question resulted from interviews. The authors have visited Company A and NGO B, the first is concerned with collecting waste in greater Beirut while the second aims at spreading awareness to e-waste's dangers on governmental and social levels alike. Question two was discussed throughout surveys filled by random individuals from Lebanese society. The answers to both research questions came in a way that proves both hypotheses assumed at the beginning of the research, namely that e-waste poses a great threat to the Lebanese environment and that laws must be implemented to regulate collection and disposal of electronic appliances; also, e-cycling initiatives must be encouraged to reduce the quantities of generated e-waste. Hypothesis two if environment friendliness and affinity to right e-waste disposal depend on the educational level of any given citizen has been proven to be true while analyzing the answers in the survey.},

  abstract={Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is the method through which test is done to measure the psychological condition of a person in viewing the world and making the decision. It is generally divided into 4 preference sets namely,' Extraversion - Introversion,' `Sensing - Intuition',' Thinking - Feeling',' Judgment - Perception'. This test is applied in many areas like, for recruitment of people into jobs, to choose career depending on one's personality, to estimate a person himself/herself, selecting optional subjects in universities. Here, the aim of the research work was to propose an optimized prediction analysis for allotting members to a project by the Project Manager by testing the members' ability through MBTI testing method and further analyzing and justifying that the person selected was most suitable for the project or required some advice for their improvement in the work. By using MBTI assessment the dataset for the proposed work has been created. For developing the experimental work, collection of answers for the predesigned questionnaire available in MBTI site from our college students were taken. Based on these data a novel method was developed to select a group of members who are fit to be in that project according to the requirements of the project manager. This is done through Homophily affect and thus study the behavior of each member within the group to test the rate of appropriate members selected by the project manager. Simulation was done by using R-studio and MATLAB thereby identifying the weak and strong bond among the members of the project.},

  abstract={TV stream structuring is the first step in the description process of telecasts for TV archives holders like the French National Audiovisual Institute. It consists in breaking down automatically the stream into telecasts and advertisings. One can think TV stream structuring consists in a simple alignment of the TV guide (for example electronic program guide or TV magazines) on the stream. But our study shows that only 34% of telecasts appear in program guides. In average, 2 hours per day, composed of short telecasts and advertisings, are missing. We propose in this article a way to model and predict TV schedules (one day or one week of telecasts on a channel) by using a new extension of Markov models and regression trees. The goal is that the improved schedules obtained by the prediction can be aligned on the stream.},

  abstract={Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has recently shown good performance in solving large-scale sensing tasks. As an essential topic in MCS, recommending tasks to participants has received extensive attention from researchers. Most studies assume that participants are absolutely rational, which is unrealistic because it is difficult for participants to know all the information about the transaction. Furthermore, most of them do not consider how to learn the preferences of new participants. In addition, their works are difficult to extend to different MCS scenarios. Considering the above problems, we propose an extensible bounded rationality-based task recommendation scheme (EBRTR), which contains a task recommendation framework and a bounded rationality decision-making model. First, a task recommendation framework that can be easily extended to various MCS scenarios is designed. Second, in our bounded rationality decision-making model, for participants with historical task information, according to the implicit information in their historical tasks, the human thinking mode with bounded rationality is simulated, and the improved classification and regression tree (ICART) algorithm is designed to construct the decision tree. For participants who newly join the platform, social information is introduced to construct an initial decision tree. Finally, extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract={Today's military faces enormous pressure to downsize and restructure. In addition, operations-other-than-war, such as humanitarian assistance and peace-keeping, differ significantly from traditional combat missions. The unique characteristics of peace-keeping missions involve inherently more complex command arrangements. Moreover, the increased political sensitivity associated with these missions further exacerbates the stress on command and control (C2) arrangements. Thus, Joint and Coalition doctrine is more complex and reliant on the synchronized employment of combined arms. The process of organizing for Joint and Coalition operations must be driven by the disparate missions and the requisite tasks involved. Depending on the specific mission, the diverse range of future anticipated operations can require a wide variety of service capabilities under a Joint Force Coalition. It follows that the C2 organization should be flexible in order to allow commanders to meet the many and diverse operations that are expected to continue to undertaken. This paper reports on the use of measurement instruments developed for the initial experiment conducted under the Adaptive Architectures for Command and Control (A2C2) program. The goal of the A2C2 research effort is to provide insights based on exploring innovative thinking and empirical research on organizational design that can assist in positioning the Joint community to face the diverse challenges and dynamic changes that are projected for the future.},

  abstract={Nowadays, it is easy to find a number of different hybrid approaches for fuzzy modeling. All these approaches were built in a very ad-hoc manner, and did not follow a systematic approach. However, we think that some kind of information system which helps in the study of how algorithms can combine to model systems in a fuzzy fashion should be very helpful. In this article, we propose METALA (META-Learning Architecture), an architecture to study the typical processes of machine learning, to study the particular issue of fuzzy modeling.},

  abstract={Recently strong AI emerged from artificial intelligence due to need for a thinking machine. In this domain, it is necessary to deal with dynamic incomplete data and understanding of how machines make their decision is also important, especially in information system domain. One type of learning called Covering Algorithms (CA) can be used instead of the difficult statistical machine learning methods to produce simple rule with powerful prediction ability. However, although using CA as the base of strong AI is a novel idea, doing so with the current methods available is not possible. Thus, this paper presents a novel CA (RULES-IT) and tests its performance over incomplete data. This algorithm is the first incremental algorithm in its family, and CA as a whole, that transfer rules from different domains and introduce intelligent aspects using simple representation. The performance of RULES-IT will be tested over incomplete and complete data along with other algorithms in the literature. It will be validated using 5-fold cross validation in addition to Friedman with Nemenyi post hoc tests to measure the significance and rank the algorithms.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={200-204},
  abstract={Main functions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are neuroprotection and synaptic plasticity. A common single nucleotide polymorphism in the human BDNF gene (Val66Met) impairs activity-dependent secretion of the BDNF, and carrying Met allele is associated with poorer learning. We explored the role of BDNF polymorphism in short-term plasticity induced by complex cognitive stimulation with creativity thinking tasks in Caucasian adults from younger (22.7±3.7 years old, N = 63) and older (63.5±5.2 years old, N = 49) age groups. Resting-state EEG with eyes open was recorded prior to and immediately after forty-minute verbal and figural creative task performance. The EEG spectral density in individual alpha frequency band was calculated using FFT in pre-task and post-task intervals. All subjects were genotyped for BDNF status. ANOVA revealed more left-sided (left>right) changes from pre-task to post-task intervals in Val/Val homozygotes in comparison with Met carriers. BDNF-associated alpha power asymmetry indicator in frontal region, which is well-known manifestation of motivational withdrawal/approach, was strongly correlated with interest in tasks (not with originality, amount of ideas, or task difficulty). Mediation analysis confirmed that attenuated frontal asymmetry (left-right) of pre/post task changes in Met carriers in comparison to Val/Val was associated with lower interest in tasks - component of internal motivation for creative problem solving. These findings suggest that complex cognitive stimulation with creativity tasks induced tendency towards withdrawal motivation in Met carriers in comparison to Val/Val at the level of brain activity.},

  abstract={Disease diagnosis in smart settings has been transformed by the fast development of technology, especially the Internet of Things (IoT) and Swarm Intelligence. Various health-related data may be continually monitored and collected in smart environments due to the abundance of sensors. However, this data's vast quantity and complexity complicates accurate illness diagnosis and early management. Inspired by the coordinated actions of flocks of birds and swarms of insects, Swarm Intelligence provides a novel paradigm for analyzing and understanding this mountain of data. Hence, this paper proposes a Swarm Intelligence-enabled Disease Diagnosis (SI-DD) in smart environments using IoT-based sensors. Smart systems use algorithms motivated by swarm behaviour to assess data from several sensors in concert, allowing for faster, more accurate illness diagnosis. As a shape of collective swarm intelligence, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) enables make healthcare treatments more effective. As a result, sufferers get care tailor-made to their unique desires, thinking about their scientific history and the kingdom of the healthcare machine. This article examines the most distinguished makes use of the Internet of Things and Swarm Intelligence in healthcare. It highlights how those techniques have already shown their promise for higher contamination detection. With this in thoughts, it's clear that the usage of clever sensors prepared with Swarm Intelligence for infection detection in clever settings is a viable path toward enhancing healthcare results and the first-rate of existence for sufferers. This novel approach has the capability to revolutionize contamination surveillance, prognosis, and control, leading to greater cost-effective scientific services and higher results for sufferers.},

  abstract={Organized misinformation campaigns on Twitter continue to proliferate, even as the platform acknowledges such activities through its transparency center. These deceptive initiatives significantly impact vital societal issues, including climate change, thus spurring research aimed at pinpointing and intercepting these malicious actors. Present-day algorithms for detecting bots harness an array of data drawn from user profiles, tweets, and network configurations, delivering commendable outcomes. Yet, these strategies mainly concentrate on postincident identification of malevolent users, hinging on static training datasets that categorize individuals based on historical activities. Diverging from this approach, we advocate for a forward-thinking methodology, which utilizes user data to foresee and mitigate potential threats before their realization, thereby cultivating more secure, equitable, and unbiased online communities. To this end, our proposed technique forecasts malevolent activities by tracing the projected trajectories of user embeddings before any malevolent action materializes. For validation, we employed a dynamic directed multigraph paradigm to chronicle the evolving engagements between Twitter users. When juxtaposed against the identical dataset, our technique eclipses contemporary methodologies by an impressive 40.66% in F score (F1 score) in the anticipatory identification of harmful users. Furthermore, we undertook a model evaluation exercise to gauge the efficiency of distinct system elements.},
