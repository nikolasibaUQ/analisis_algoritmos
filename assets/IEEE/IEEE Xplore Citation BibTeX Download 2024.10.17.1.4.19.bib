  abstract={The information system design process is not well understood in spite of a rich literature stream dealing with the general notion of 'design'. The few studies of IS designer behaviors that are reported in IS have focused on small tasks in single sessions, and have ignored the impact of modeling techniques on the design process. In this paper, we report preliminary results based on a study of two designers engaged in a multi-session design task using the object-oriented design modeling techniques. We use an extended version of the model proposed by Adelson and Soloway to analyze the verbal protocols. Our observations and interpretations focus on the existence of problem and design spaces and designers' use of these during design. Specifically, we discuss the distinction between problem and design spaces during object-oriented design, the shifts in emphasis between problem and design spaces, and changes in designer behaviors between the two spaces.},

  abstract={The paper describes a new foundational taxonomy of tangible multimedia, a genre of multimedia which deploys the use of tangible artefacts, based on Piagets theory of cognitive development. A taxonomy for setting tangibility in multimedia realm is required for grounding guideline stipulating the consistent way of using tangible artefacts within multimedia context. This paper begins discussion by looking into facets of tangibility dimension by way of literature review. The taxonomy suggests multimedia tangibility can be achieved at least on six facets, namely abdication, loose, naturalness, link semantics, cardinality, and comprehensive mapping facets. Discussion followed by elaboration of each of their associated functions. The paper is concluded with a brief description of a research results, which revealed the efficacy of tangible multimedia compliant with some of the facets of the taxonomy in elevating learners learning performance.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Suicide is one of the major causes of death globally. Analysis of social media posts and in-depth insights show that some people have suicide ideas. In order to save more lives, it is crucial to comprehend the behavior of suicidal attempters. However, identifying and explaining suicidal thoughts poses a significant challenge in psychiatry. Additionally, analysing suicidal behavior is a complex procedure involving several variables based on the individual’s preferences and the data type. Although traditional methods have been utilized to identify clinical factors for suicide ideation detection (SID), these models often lack interpretability and understanding. Therefore, the primary aim of this research is to apply several deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) techniques such as BERT, LSTM, BiLSTM, RF, SVM, GaussianNB, LR, and KNeighbors blending with interpretable models such as LIME and SHAP to provide valuable insights into the importance of different features and make models more transparent in the SID process. The experiments were conducted on a publicly available dataset comprising 24,101 posts, categorized as either suicidal or non-suicidal. The implemented method brings about significant enhancements in performance in comparison. A comparison of all performance measures reveals that the LSTM model is particularly good at processing and classifying textual data, with higher accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores than the other models tested.},

  abstract={Critical path analysis is a traditional way to study the parallelism of conservative parallel simulation. In this paper, we propose a new technique called state causality analysis to accurately model the conservative parallel network simulation. A theorem of simulation time advancement is presented and proved. Different from critical path analysis, our method focuses on the dependency of the logical process states instead of the unpredictable events. The effects of many algorithm-independent factors, such as lookahead, I/O overhead, physical transfer delay, processor speed and event distribution, are all taken into consideration. With this method, the complicated relations between parallel performance and the algorithm-independent factors can be revealed distinctly, which however cannot be revealed by critical path analysis in most cases. The theoretical analyses and experiments show that our method always predict a stricter upper bound on the performance of a given network simulation task than critical path analysis, which may provide a baseline to evaluate the conservative synchronization algorithms excluding the effects of algorithm-independent factors.},

  abstract={The field of machine learning and artificial intelligence is growing rapidly. The deep neural network is a field of ML which is showing greater possibility. The deep neural network has been widely acknowledged as being in a golden age and advancing with the advent of new technologies. It is slowly becoming the leader of the technological world in artificial intelligence. The models which are built by machine learning algorithms with great accuracy help in every sector of human evolution. Image and audio processing is done through many algorithms to intensify its behavioral pattern. The development of modern art is largely dependent on the painters who are developing the style. The Deep Dream algorithm can also do the artistic creation of the image and audio. The deep dream algorithm which googles engineer Alexander Mordvintsevin built in the year 2015. It enhances the patterns in the multimedia through algorithmic pareidolia. It creates a dream-like effect. It gives a new vision of hallucinations to images. This could be used in the health sector for the purpose of detecting diseases and defects through scans of the patients. It is redefining lower-definition multimedia to higher-definition multimedia. Previous model were able to only generate one of the multimedia format. Proposed system will be able to create multimedia based on DeepDream and link different formats together so that they appear to be generated together.},

  abstract={We introduce a Producer-Customer model and use it to add an innovative portion to the “Digital Systems” course materials. In this work, we have developed and tested ten Intellectual Property (IP) cores, real products, which are either defective or improvable. A defective product does not function as it should. An improvable product works in accordance with its specification; however, it has potential for improvement. Two different directions are possible for improvements: performance or area. Students will work in the customer and then producer settings to diagnose and then resolve the issues, respectively. This work is an attempt to fulfill the Kern Entrepreneurial Engineering Network (KEEN) Students Outcomes, hence help instill an entrepreneurial mindset in engineering undergraduates.

This is particularly relevant when we consider curricula for various subdisciplines of computing. Examining various issues and voices, this paper lays out an informed case for defining the landscape of computing. This work proposes a Disciplinary Boundary Model, in contrast to a socially-constructed approach for defining computing subdisciplines. This model can be used to describe the computing landscape by examining the underlying “invariant” activity of human inquiry, and suggest that it be used for defining the landscape for various computing curricula.},

In this paper, we use our producer-customer model to craft and add innovative lab assignments to the “Computer Architecture and Organization” course. The new lab assignments are based on the six products or IP cores that we have developed. Each product is either defective or improvable. There are some discrepancies between the behavior of a defective product and its user guide; in other words, a defective product does not work as it should. The performance of an improvable product can be enhanced. Each team of students will first work as a customer to identify the defects or the improvable aspects of a product. They will then challenge another team, the producer, to resolve the issues. We have received encouraging anonymous feedback from students.},

  title={Critical Radical Analysis Network for Chinese Character Recognition}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={2878-2884},
  abstract={Zero-shot learning is a challenging problem in many tasks due to the lack of training samples of the unseen classes. The radical-based zero-shot Chinese character recognition methods treat Chinese characters as a combination of radicals and structures, and recognize Chinese characters by identifying the radicals and structures contained in them. Current approaches generally treat the contribution of all radicals to Chinese character recognition as the same, and the recognition results rely on the network’s ability to recognize radicals and their corresponding position information, ignoring the potential value of radicals themselves in eliminating the uncertainty of Chinese characters. In this paper, we model the problem of radical-based Chinese character recognition as an uncertainty elimination problem and propose a Critical Radical Analysis Network (CRAN) to explore the Ideographic Description Sequence (IDS) information for zero-shot Chinese character recognition. Specifically, we propose a novel method to compute the critical values of radicals based on information theory using the predefined Chinese character IDS dictionary. In recognition, we use an iterative approach to translate the predicted radical sequence to target Chinese characters. That is, the radicals of the predicted sequence are sorted in descending order of the critical value, and then the radicals are continuously selected in this order as the information obtained to eliminate the uncertainty of the Chinese character until the character is recognized. We conduct experiments on the CTW, CASIA-AHCDB, and CASIA-HWDB datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves the ability of recognizing unseen Chinese characters, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Transportation systems design might be supported by participatory approaches refining service design, user experiences, and safety research. The evaluation of mobility alternatives as design improvement strategies requires more advanced instructional techniques with new structures of complexity that can demonstrate, analyze, or compare system performances in order to achieve environmental sustainability in general and the well-being of the end-users in particular. As an emerging technology, games are capable of representing operations and management of passenger freight transportation and increase situational awareness of capacity bottlenecks. However, few research efforts have been devoted to the synthesis of the research progress. Based on the profiling methodology that has been previously employed in retrospect of healthcare simulations, this article presents a bibliometric review of games for health in transportation systems. The study carries out a literature analysis of the modelling methods to assemble gamified scenarios from a planning and managerial perspective. The Web of Science Core Collections are used to identify research items and investigate all the game-based studies in the cross-disciplinary research area of transportation and public health. The technology, game mechanism, and the health-related issue addressed are grouped into broad categories. The research findings are three-fold. (1) The majority of publications are classified into research efforts revolving around slow and road transportation modes. (2) Although scores, badges, and challenges are considered as the frequently seen gamification features, environmental simulation, avatars, and narratives appear as game mechanisms for the activation of the individual decision-making process. (3) Introducing system dynamics, human-computer interaction design, and a stakeholder accountability framework into the multi-stakeholder simulation setting leverages gaming outcomes with health benefits amid transportation system end-users. The literature study concludes with an integrated framework summarizing the best design practices between 2002 and 2022 on how the lessons learned from serious gameplay in virtual environments could translate into real mobility improvements. A selection of future research questions is curated to envisage new links between transportation and health research communities.},

  abstract={Knowledge of monetary flow between firms can give a significant advantage both from a profit or research point of view. So-called firm-to-firm transaction networks are valuable in analyzing a market or an economy. However, such detailed and complete data is seldom available. In this work, we aim at supporting economists by reusing available financial information from different sources at different levels of detail and completeness. With our technique, experts' domain knowledge can be fused together with publicly available information to extract a representative, coherent instance of the transaction network. Supporting underspecification is important, as experts may develop partial econometric models. Our technique fills such blanks by systematically guesstimating missing information. Our approach builds upon formal foundations of satisfiability modulo theories and thus obtained transaction networks respect constraints imposed by domain knowledge and input data sources. We outline a taxonomy of general data types in the domain, and we programmatically construct formal predicates describing them. We demonstrate both guestimation of missing information of a transaction network and validation of external, expert-provided models. Finally, we investigate feasibility and performance of the advocated technique over a fragment of the Austrian economy.},

This approach is based on a referential framework to analyse the requirements of strategic alignment. The objective of this work is to give an overview of the DS concepts.

  abstract={Dull and abstract mechanical concepts, along with cumbersome formulas, often pose challenges for students in mechanical course learning. We propose an innovative approach that combines modeling, numerical computation, and E-learning software development to enhance students' learning enthusiasm. Focusing on the teaching knowledge point of “polar moment of inertia”, we examine the automotive transmission axle as a specific research case. By constructing a finite element model and conducting numerical calculations, we generated vivid visualization materials, including Mises stress and displacement cloud images. Leveraging the C# programming language, we developed E-learning software that incorporates the calculus derivation processes for axle torsion deformation. The results of our teaching experiment demonstrate the effectiveness of this teaching innovation, with a 90.63 % acceptance rate. Visualization materials, such as Mises stress cloud images, facilitate students' understanding of abstract concepts, garnering an 89.06% acceptance rate. Moreover, the E-learning software significantly increased students' learning enthusiasm, with an 85.91 % acceptance rate. The adoption of modeling and simulation to create digital materials for mechanical education provides a robust foundation for E-learning software development and classroom application. Digitalization and E-learning software are poised to be vital trends in future educational development, with ample opportunities for further exploration by scholars in the field.},

  abstract={The aesthetics of violence creates a visual-auditory spectacle in the films and a significant cultural ethos in the postmodern context. The combination of violence and aesthetics in the films creates a sense of paradox, subverting the audience's stereotypes about violence and evoking a new aesthetic experience physically and psychologically. To achieve such complicated aesthetic effects to a new level in the digital era, it is innovative to synthesise the literary theory, aesthetic criticism, cinematic strategies, procedural modelling and creative computation to produce more attractive and experimental stories in the film industry. Computer science facilitates the stylisation of violent films in a narrative, technical and artistic way. The paper will take Freudian psychoanalysis and Kantian aestheticism as the philosophical foundation, present an index system of evaluation and a model to compute the weight of violence and artistic beauty and further measure the effect of aesthetics conveyed by the violence. The application of the model will promote the creativity in the interactive narrative about the aesthetics of violence in films.},

To review and categorize this concept for modelers and evaluators, we used the Framework Method to examine 35 purposively sampled studies of agent-based and discrete-event simulation modeling in healthcare operation and policy. Four research orientations emerged in the sampled studies, ranging from academic, unilateral passive stakeholder, unilateral active stakeholder, and multilateral stakeholders. From one orientation to the next, studies engage more stakeholders in more research steps and entail distinct requirements for quality assessment. Our analysis highlights the complexity of healthcare for which the best approach to engage stakeholders, demonstrate value and assess quality depends upon the research orientation.},

  abstract={Today, computing graduates see a bright outlook thanks to the high demand for skills driven by the increasing importance of technology as the main driving force behind business transformation. As technology continues to grow exponentially over recent years, computing graduates have some of the highest starting salaries in the market [20] [19]. Even though universities have increased production of computing degree graduates in recent years, it is insufficient to fill the jobs available in the market [14]. Therefore, going forward, the demand is likely to further increase. The continued demand for computing programs in universities has led to an increased intake size, thus straining faculty workloads. Universities must consider funneling more resources into computing programs to address faculty’s increasing workload. Past studies have shown that peer learning environments enable increased productivity for faculty and enhanced educational quality for students [27] [15]. In this article, we describe a peer assisted learning model for an introductory programming course — Coders Assembly — designed and driven by undergraduate students in a computing program. Our model centers on four key areas – process, people, content, and technology. We reflect on our experience of implementing this peer assisted learning model and the result of a student survey.},

  abstract={Handloom sector in India has been there for decades and weaving has been the profession by tradition for many of the communities that have existed since a longtime. If we observe the past few years, we see that there is a decline in the handloom export and an increase in the workforce attrition in this sector. There are multiple reasons for this shift in the workforce from handloom sector to other sectors which are more promising in terms of better pay and relatively less manual labour. This paper tries to propose a new business model that is backed up by artificial intelligence and machine language algorithms that will help and enable to create a centralized platform for the weavers that can give them the direct access to the market insights, customer preferences, latest trends, customer feedback, and much more. The objective of this paper is to reduce the burden from the weaver who other-wise have no insights on the market demand or customer preferences, which creates a demand supply gap and discourages them from continuing the profession of weaving as it costs them huge in terms of investment be it money needed for the looms or the time, and energy spent behind the loom in weaving the handwoven products.},

  abstract={This Research to Practice Full Paper describes an study with Problem Based Learning (PBL). PBL promotes knowledge through the motivational appeal that problematization arouses. However, there are still points to be explored and potentialized, with the use of technologies to achieve Motivation. Thus, in this study we seek to understand how students' motivation to learn can be affected by sending automatic motivational triggers (sounds, notifications, etc.) during the execution of activities, in order to stimulate certain behaviors, such as studying, doing the task, complete an activity. The methodology for the validation of the triggers was developed in two moments: (i) in 2017 with the participation of 60 students of the Software Engineering course; and (ii) in 2018 with 23 students of the second year of the Computer Engineering course. At the end of each of these studies, students' views were grouped by class and expressed through the construction of the Discourse Collective Subject (DCS). Thus, this study contributes to the discussion and presentation of the DCS as an approach capable of assisting teachers during the evaluation of the activities proposed in the classroom, mainly because it makes it possible to observe the opinion of a group as a single subject.},

  title={CRule: Category-Aware Symbolic Multihop Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={38},
  number={5},
  pages={56-64},
  abstract={Multihop reasoning is essential in knowledge graph (KG) research and applications. Current methods rely on specific KG entities, while human cognition operates at a more abstract level. This article proposes a category-aware rule-based (CRule) approach for symbolic multihop reasoning. Specifically, given a KG, CRule first categorizes entities and constructs a category-aware KG; it then uses rules retrieved from the categorized KG to perform multihop reasoning on the original KG. Experiments on five datasets show that CRule is simple, is effective, and combines the advantages of symbolic and neural network methods. It overcomes symbolic reasoning’s complexity limitations, can perform reasoning on KGs of more than 300,000 edges, and can be three times more efficient than neural network models.},
