  abstract={In this research, we show two experiments using non-verbal interaction. We think nonverbal communication is basic, and important for communication between human. Moreover, We focus on the networked robotics which is fusion of network technology and robot technology. We constructed nonverbal interface by using human natural motion. In the first experiment, we created commands using hand motion which is based on natural motion, such as beckoning, hissing away and so on. We constructed robot manipulation system using these commands. Furthermore, we compared the user-friendly of our system with present keyboard manipulation system. In the second experiment, in order to manipulate a robot using more natural motion, we proposed 'pointing movement'. Moreover, we constructed networked robots that recognizes human motion spatially. Accordingly, the user was able to manipulate the robot with more natural motion in larger space.},

  abstract={Summary form only given. Fractional Brownian motion (fBm), a 1/f, fractal process, has long been considered a plausible model for financial time series. A fractal structure of the market, indicating the presence of correlations across time, hints at the possibility of some predictability. Recent advances in time/frequency localized transforms by the applied mathematics and electrical engineering communities provide us with powerful new methods for the analysis of this type of process. In fact, it has been proven by Wornell that the wavelet transform is an optimal (KL) transform for fBm processes. With this result, we consider using the wavelet decomposition to analyze financial time series. Specifically, the discrete wavelet transform can be used to decompose a signal into several scales, while maintaining time localization of events in each scale. In terms of financial time series, we can conceptually think of each of these scales as the contribution to the price movement from the information and traders associated with a given investment horizon, for instance, long term traders, such as institutional investors, basing their trades on long term information, form the low-frequency component of the market. Once we have extracted out these scales, we can view each as a stationary time series, which can be modeled, analyzed and predicted individually, either independently, or in conjunction with other scales and data that is relevant to that scale. For the case of prediction, the forecasts from each scale can be fused together, with traditional techniques such as hard coded decision rules, or with a neural network, to arrive at tomorrow's direction and/or price.},

  abstract={In eastern Europe, in the last few years the IT services industry has significantly grown due to the externalization of IT operations from western Europe and America: production plants, communications, satellites, etc. In this context the pressure on the eastern IT services labor market has increased. IT services companies employed students with no IT background and trained them in their in house academies in order to respond fast to their contractual obligations. The time frame to form IT operations specialists is very narrow so they need to think of new strategies to speedup their training. In this sense auto-generative learning objects as the second generation of learning objects are a potential solution since it allows autonomous learning anytime during the day, when queuing, in the subway or during school or job breaks. Learners are trained with automatically generated dynamic content, get automatic evaluation of their responses and receive dynamic feedback. Thus, they can exercise autonomously different learning situations benefiting from automatic evaluation.},

The model has capacity to simulate the brain’s thinking process objectively and avoid the influence of the forecasters’ subjective judgment. The present model is capable to predict the 12-hour ahead typhoon surge deviation in high tide efficiently. At the same time, an intelligent storm-flood forecasting system is designed and built, and the system not only can predict the storm flood in the future 12 hours, but also is useful to mitigate the typhoon disasters in Shanghai.

  abstract={This article illustrates a simulation method to find a sizing and economic of a required photovoltaic array for a photovoltaic building in Malaysia. This paper represents the result using by Matlab software. It is known that the important factor for photovoltaic system is cost of a system, and because of several kinds of the photovoltaic array we have the right to elect the best array with the best efficiency. The popular types of materials are crystalline and thin films, which have differences in terms of light absorption efficiency, energy conversion efficiency, manufacturing technology and cost of production. Different kinds of crystalline materials like a mono-crystalline, polycrystalline are available. In this paper, the generated current and generated power by the photovoltaic array is calculated according to daily solar irradiation when the case study is Malaysia. Think over generated power of each array's and also according to required energy for a typically building, the number of photovoltaic array is estimated then the cost of the solar array is calculated. System is simulated by Matlab software, and the results are discussed. The simulation is about sizing in order to select the best array for photovoltaic system to have a optimize system according to size of the system.},

  abstract={The reason for this review is to introduce a basic diagram of steering convention for low power and lossy system. Additionally talk about the points of interest and impediments of a convention and think about them. Wireless sensor networks are appealing to specialists because of their extensive variety of use potential in ranges, for example, target identification and tracking, environmental monitoring, industrial process monitoring, and strategic frameworks. On the other hand, lower sensing ranges result in dense networks, which bring the need to accomplish a proficient medium access protocol subject to power imperatives. The IPv6 directing convention for low-power and lossy systems (RPL) has been as of late standardized by the Engineering Task Force (IETF) steering convention for low-control and Lossy networks (ROLL) working social event to bolster IPv6 directing for asset compelled contraptions in the present day, home, additionally, metropolitan situations. Regardless, a couple studies have created the impression that RPL may experience low delivery rates, especially in extensive scale organizations. This paper gives an in-depth examination of the protocol attributes and outline decisions that create such lack of quality issues. In proposed work, we perform data compression and trust calculation which will reduce data sending time and also improves lossless data transmission.},

  year={2013},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={365-369},
  abstract={The traditional way of thinking in controller design prefers the use of the “state space representation” introduced by R. Kalman in the early sixties of the past century. This system description is in close relationship with linear or at least partly linear system in which the linear part can be used in forming a quadratic Lyapunov function in the stability proof. In the standard model of such systems it is assumed that the state of the system is not directly observable, only certain linear functions of the state variable are directly measurable. Since such approaches introduce certain feedback gains for the state variable, observers are needed that calculate the estimation of the state variable on the basis of directly measurable quantities. The Luenberger observers solve this task via introducing a differential equation for the estimated state. In order to avoid the mathematical difficulties of Lyapunov's “direct method” the “Robust Fixed Point Transformations (RFPT)” were introduced in a novel adaptive technique that instead of the state space representation directly utilized the available approximate model of the system to estimate its “response function”. In this approach it was assumed that the system's response is directly observable and an iterative sequence was generated by the use of “Banach's Fixed Point Theorem” that converged to an appropriate deformation of the rough initial model to obtain precise trajectory tracking. In the present paper it is shown that the Luenberger observers and the RFPT-based mathod can be combined in a more conventional approach of the adaptive controllers that are designed on the basis of finding appropriate feedback gains. Illustrative simulation examples are presented to substantiate this statement.},

  abstract={The Plant Hospitals Maintenance Department maintains the physical environment and provides related services to support medical centers is in reaching their goal of excellence in the delivery of healthcare and public service. Thus, health-care facilities exist to save lives, improve patient health, and reduce pain. Administrators rightly do not consider themselves to be power reliability experts. Yet without emergency power to ensure continuous power to medical equipment, the health-care facility's life-saving mission can be jeopardized, costs can soar, and the profitability of the facility, on which its continued existence depends, can be threatened. With hospitals becoming more electronic, more must be protected by emergency power. Hospital systems increasingly overlap electronically. Well-designed emergency power systems adapt to the changing environment. Emergency power is thus critical and is expensive but if medical center does not have electricity, that's even more expensive. We should think of everything electronic a hospital runs on: security, radiology, cat scans, and operating rooms. And, that's just the big stuff. This paper act as a direct resource for some management plans supporting the environment of Care which should provide a safe, functional, supportive, and effective environment for patients, staff members, and individuals who come to Saudi medical centers facilities.

QA systems employing combination of SCB and resolution theorem proving have been used to provide both satisfying and hypothetical answers. Satisfying answers are associated with ground term corresponding with questions whose logical form contains variables. Hypothetical answer is an answer which comes from the story or plot of text, and required logical thinking because it is not explicitly stated in the knowledge domain. In this case, the answer can be considered as a set of logical formula called skolemize clauses defining sufficient conditions characteristic the tuples of individuals which satisfying the query.},

  abstract={This Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) can provide enormous benefits to the Relational Databases in the aspects of Data Security, Cryptographic Encryption, and Compliances. For every transaction, the stored data must be decrypted before applying the updates as well as should be encrypted before permanently storing back at the storage level. By adding this extra functionality to the database, the general thinking denotes that the Database (DB) going to hit some performance overhead at the CPU and storage level. However, The Oracle Corporation has adversely claimed that their latest Oracle DB version 19c TDE feature can provide significant improvement in the optimization of CPU and no overhead at the storage level for data processing. Impressively, it is true. the results of this paper prove too. Most interestingly the results also revealed about highly impacted components in the servers which are not yet disclosed in any of the previous research work. This paper completely concentrates on CPU, IO, and RAM performance analysis and identifying the bottlenecks along with possible solutions.},

  abstract={China is a country of many different ethnic groups since genetic, geographical and culture formation of a different customs and ways of thinking. In order to study the eye movement behavior when the different ethnic groups observe things, firstly, we use Tobii eye tracker to record the representation data from the different ethnic groups which are used to solve Sudoku problem. Meanwhile, the data from different ethnic groups were compressed into 16 dimensional data and constructed the data sets. Secondly, we analysis the diversity of eye movement behavior data sets derive from Buyi, Mongolian, Korean, Dong and Han five ethnics respectively. Furthermore, a variety of machine learning methods are explored to analysis the eye movement behavior data sets. The experimental results show that eye movement behavior diversity between different ethnic groups.},

  abstract={There are some weaknesses in the traditional safety evaluation methods, such as, slow reasoning, low accuracy and so on, so thinking of a variety of factors which affect gas safety, a gas safety evaluation index system is built, which focuses on the state of gas, mine ventilation, gas monitoring, safety management and kindling. Combining the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method with gray correlation method and BP neural network method, taking Hei Longjiang Longmay Group as an example, a gas safety evaluation in its five mines was made. The results show that using different integrated comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate the gas safety in the same mine, the results are different. It requires decision-makers to consider many factors and adopt more appropriate and scientific methods when making a comprehensive evaluation, which makes a right decision.},

  abstract={Index is used to improve the efficiency of database queries. Because the database needs to handle very large amount of data, while the memory is expensive, limited capacity, and the database must meet certain real-time, finding an effective design approach of the index is very necessary. This paper describes that through the B and T tree performance analysis during the process of designing the index, put forward the new thinking of improving the index, after doing the experiment, as allow the database to either use the B tree or use the T tree, in time and space, how to select both timely in order to enhance the query, insert, and delete efficiency of the database index.},
