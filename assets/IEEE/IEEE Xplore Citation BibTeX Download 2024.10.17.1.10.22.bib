  abstract={Electricity has been the most important energy resource for daily applications. With the trends of continuously increasing of electricity cost and imperative need of CO2 emission reductions, forward-thinking governments are taking great importance of optimization on electricity trading for national economic and environmental developments. Although conventional electricity trading approaches such as electricity pool, bilateral market, and so on have been applied in many countries, these methods are lack of the attention to emerging renewable energy options. Based on the above, this paper presents a Data Management Scheme for Electricity Trading (DaMaSET), especially adding the role of Micro-gird. With the support of ICT-enabled load forecasting model, the proposed DaMaSET is capable of shaping an information processing module for electricity-oriented Energy Management System, addressing a valuable research direction in terms of advancing electricity trading, and further indicating a systematic perspective on energy-related environmental sustainability.},

  abstract={The role of computers is indispensable in various aspects of life, especially in the Production Monitoring information system which increases work productivity. PT Citra Banjar Abadi is a company that produces iron and steel electric towers for the needs of making High Voltage Power Line Towers, where this research takes place. The problem that occurs at this time is that the steel production monitoring information system is not optimal because it still uses a manual system so that there are often problems, one of which is the problem of production progress that cannot be monitored properly so that the completion of production is not on time. The purpose of this study is to provide solutions to problems that occur using the FAST (Framework Analytical System Thinking) method. The result of this research is to produce a steel production monitoring information system for the Tower Extra High Voltage Power Line for PT Citra Banjar Abadi, Indonesia.},

  title={Prototypical Concept Representation},

  pages={7357-7370},
  abstract={Concepts are building blocks of human thinking. For machines, concept understanding has also been increasingly important, which makes concept representation a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence. While many concepts have their instances, the massive amount of information carried by instances has long been ignored in current concept representation, which limits the usage of these concepts in applications. In this paper, inspired by prototype theory in cognitive science, we propose prototypical concept representation for machines, which represents each concept with a distributed prototype derived from representations of its instances. For prototypical representation learning, we further introduce a novel model named Prototypical Siamese Network (PSN). PSN is trained under the supervision of isA determination, one of the most important concept-related applications. Results of extensive experiments demonstrate that, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, thus validating the effectiveness of prototypical concept representation.},

  abstract={World Wide Web is speeding up its pace into an intelligent and decentralized ecosystem, as seen in the campaign of Web 3.0 and forthcoming Web 4.0. Marked by the Europe Commission's latest mention of Web 4.0, a race towards strategic Web 4.0 success has started. Web 4.0 is committed to bringing the next technological transition with an open, secure, trustworthy fairness and digital ecosystem for individuals and businesses in private and public sectors. Despite overlapping scopes and objectives of Web 3.0 and Web 4.0 from academic and industrial perspectives, there are distinct and definitive features and gaps for the next generation of WWW. In this review, a brief introduction to WWW development unravels the entangled but consistent requirement of a more vivid web experience, enhancing human-centric experience in both societal and technical aspects. Moreover, the review brings a decentralized intelligence prospect of view on native AI entities for Web 4.0, envisioning sustainable, autonomous and decentralized AI services for the entire Web 4.0 environment, powering a self-sustainable Decentralized Physical and Software Infrastructure for Computing Force Network, Semantic Network, Virtual/Mixed Reality, and Privacy-preserving content presumption. The review aims to reveal that Web 4.0 offers native intelligence with focused thinking on utilizing decentralized physical infrastructure, in addition to sole requirements on decentralization, bridging the gap between Web 4.0 and Web 3.0 advances with the latest future-shaping blockchain-enabled computing and network routing protocols.},

  title={An Innovative Way to Teach Computer Programming for Middle and High Schools Students in Summer Camps}, 
  year={2023},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents our design of teaching computer programming for middle and high school students during an one-week Summer camp for the past five years, with an interruption in the Summer of 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Many researchers believe that good Summer camps can improve many students' educational and career development outcomes. Teachers and administrators are increasingly promoting Summer camp opportunities for introducing programming skills to middle and high school students. The motivation of our program is to offer hands-on projects for middle and high school students to increase their interests and knowledge in computing to meet the growing demand. Like some Summer coding camps, we picked Scratch as the programming language (designed and offered for free by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology) for the students to learn important mathematical and computer programming concepts. In addition, the students learn how to think and reason creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively, while also having fun during the one-week Summer camp. For the students already familiar with Scratch, the instructor exposed students to basic concepts of Java programming language, such as Java virtual machine, computer memory, data representation, primitive data types, casting, arithmetic, and relational operators, as well as the assignment, selection and printing statements. This article presents our findings from Summer camps organized in 2018 and 2022. Our conclusion is that all students showed a better understanding of programming concepts and confidence in computing. In the upcoming paper sections, we will describe details about how we made one-week camps to be unique compared to other similar camps. One element of our own approach is to teach in an effective and innovative using an interactive teaching approach. For example, when we designed the lecture notes, we imagine that we are students taking for the first time a computer programming course. In addition, we designed simple programming exercises for the students to solve immediately. The instructors and Teaching Assistants promptly checked the solution and award the students with stars for completing the work. This environment was very well received because it was viewed as a student collegiate competition instead of a race against time. Besides learning about computer programming, we adopted during Summer camps several strategies like those enumerated earlier to enrich our camps, as well as social events, career and professional development, and academic exposure. Our findings indicate that these additional activities proved to be beneficial to our students attending the Summer camps.},

  pages={214-219},
  abstract={Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) has become the most commonly used material in the global beverage bottling industry. PET bottle production has increased by over seven times within the last three decades. However, the use of PET has a considerably detrimental effect on the environment, and many studies have been carried out on curbing this damage. Reducing the amount of material used, design for recycling, repurposing, and reusing are possible approaches for mitigating the negative environmental impacts of the PET bottle industry. The local PET bottle market has a range of products to cater the various customer requirements. To obtain a holistic vision of the actual impacts of this industry, life cycle thinking becomes necessary. The objective of this study is to present a methodological framework for comparing the environmental performance and structural performance of PET bottle designs, using case studies from the Sri Lankan market. A life cycle assessment and a finite element analysis were carried out to evaluate the overall environmental impacts of the PET supply chain and the structural performance of PET bottles. The outcomes of the study are used to provide recommendations on the short and long-term strategies to increase the eco-friendliness of the PET bottle industry.},

  abstract={It is fascinating to think about all the many ways in which information, intellect, and knowledge may be used in human existence. Because of the lightning-fast pace at which technology is advancing, it is now essential to amass a large quantity of data in order to forecast and investigate potential developments in the field of artificial intelligence. In order to identify new information inside databases, it is necessary to apply strategies and procedures taken from a variety of information systems specializations. The practice of data mining entails not only the finding of new information but also the extraction of information that may be put to beneficial use. In recent years, considerable advances have been made in decision-making abilities in a variety of contexts, including expert systems, artificial agent networks, and machine intelligence. These businesses include companies in the fields of commerce, education, architecture, and building construction, among others. The approach that was taken in this piece was derived from an analysis of the data mining strategies and developments that have seen the greatest amount of adoption across a variety of business sectors over the course of the last five years. These patterns and modes of operation were investigated. Throughout the course of this enquiry, the processes and patterns described above were scrutinized. The use of text mining as a tool for database analysis, the enhancement of worker productivity in the industrial sector, and the application of data mining for instructional practices are only a few instances of what has been learnt in the area of education. One other illustration of this would be the use of text mining as a technique for image recognition. It was also found in the fields of trade and industry.},

  year={2021},
  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={91807-91819},
  abstract={This paper focuses on how to represent the testing face images for multi-feature face recognition. The choice of feature is critical for face recognition. The different features of the sample contribute differently to face recognition. The joint similar and specific learning (JSSL) has been effectively applied in multi-feature face recognition. In the JSSL, although the representation coefficient is divided into the similar coefficient and the specific coefficient, there is the disadvantage that the training images cannot represent the testing images well, because there are probable expressions, illuminations and disguises in the testing images. We think that the intra-class variations of one person can be linearly represented by those of other people. In order to solve well the disadvantage of JSSL, in the paper, we extend JSSL and propose the extended joint similar and specific learning (EJSSL) for multi-feature face recognition. EJSSL constructs the intra-class variant dictionary to represent the probable variation between the training images and the testing images. EJSSL uses the training images and the intra-class variant dictionary to effectively represent the testing images. The proposed EJSSL method is perfectly experimented on some available face databases, and its performance is superior to many current face recognition methods.},

  abstract={The objective of this full paper is to explore the interplay between engineering judgment and communication practices involved in completing an undergraduate systems engineering senior project. We view engineering judgment as an embodied process that emerges through discourse as individuals position themselves relative to both other individuals and disciplinary norms in a range of contexts. It happens, broadly, through a series of tasks and thinking processes through which students choose and formulate problems, make assumptions, select data, and adopt roles in relation to disciplinary norms in different contexts. We explore this conceptualization of engineering judgment using thematic and dramaturgical analysis of a single case. The data collected are a semi-structured 90-minute interview collected with one systems engineering senior after completion of their senior project and graduation from their degree program. These data are first coded using a thematic analysis approach, then re-analyzed using a dramaturgical approach. Our findings raise important issues about the blend of communication demands faced by practicing engineers that potentially impact the socialization of engineering students. Different communication demands require students to use different ways to navigate complexity. The varied communication forms also prompt students to view themselves as professionals with the capacity to judge and act from a position of professional authority that vary with the situational context.},

The study of cyborgs and the creation of humanoid robots from them Cyborgs, as the title implies, are hybrids of humans and robots. The study examines cyborg technology that is cybernetic. An artificial intelligence is referred to as a cyborg in this context. Artificial intelligence, sometimes referred to as machine intelligence, is the ability of a computer to create software and act and think like a human. Cybernetics is a branch of science that focuses on the fundamentals of communication and control in both machines and biological things. The discussion of how cybernetics and artificial intelligence interact will be the main focus of this article. Additionally, this article will assess cyborg technology in the real world, examining its benefits and drawbacks as well as the ways in which cyborgs and robots are different. Cyborgs are conceivable in today’s world. A cyborg is a humanoid robot or, more accurately, a hybrid of humans and robots. Robots are mechanical humans that depend on the intellect offered by people. With the use of artificial intelligence, cyborgs may now create their own algorithms. The fusion of logic and technology is a key aspect in the creation of a cyborg.},

  abstract={Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are a combination of complex pattern sequences, which are periodic in nature. These pattern sequences include a gamma waves that indicates deep thinking behaviour, a beta wave sequence that indicates busy and active mind status, an alpha wave segment which indicates reflective and restful behaviour, a theta wave which is an indicative of drowsiness, and a delta wave which indicates sleeping & dreaming conditions. Features like frequency changes, amplitude changes, pattern changes, etc. are used to identify chronic, ischemic and other diseases related to the brain. In order to classify these wave patterns into brain diseases like epilepsy, a series of high complexity signal processing operations are needed to be executed in tandem. These operations include signal pre-processing, feature extraction, feature selection, classification into epileptic & non-epileptic seizure and post-processing. A large variety of algorithms are developed by researchers for each of these operations. Performance of these algorithms varies largely w.r.t. the number of leads used for EEG capture, filtering efficiency, feature extraction & selection efficiency, and classifier efficiency. Thus, it becomes ambiguous for researchers and system designers to select the best possible algorithm set for their application. In order to reduce the ambiguity, this text provides a comprehensive comparison of a wide variety of epileptic & non-epileptic seizure classification system models. These models are statistically compared on the basis of overall accuracy, delay of decision making, precision, recall, f-measure and field of application. It is observed that convolutional neural network (CNN) based models outperform other models in terms of general-purpose performance, while specialized CNN models must be used for application specific deployments.},

  abstract={Mobile robots are widely used in industrial, medical, agricultural and other scenarios. The core technology is path planning. The existing methods have limited ability to deal with complex environment, low search efficiency, unsmooth path, easy to trap local optimum, and lack of real-time performance. Intelligent algorithm is a better method to solve this problem. Because the A * algorithm has strong search ability, clear algorithm thinking, and can be constrained to the global optimal path, it has the advantages of high efficiency, stability and optimality. Therefore, a motion trajectory planning method based on A * algorithm is proposed for mobile robots. Firstly, this paper analyzes several commonly used mobile robot path planning algorithms, and selects the A * algorithm as the object of this study. Secondly, the working principle, advantages and disadvantages of the A * algorithm are introduced in detail, as well as the design modules of the A * algorithm. Then, the problem of motion trajectory planning for mobile robots is analyzed and a solution is proposed. Aiming at the problems of low planning efficiency, turning path, sharp and unsmooth path, the efficiency and stability of A * algorithm are optimized by adding heuristic algorithm, corner optimization and path smoothing. Finally, the working environment of the mobile robot is established by using the grid method, and the path planning simulation experiment is carried out on the MATLAB platform. The experimental results show that the method of path planning using A * algorithm is effective and has a wide application prospect.},

  abstract={Soft computing (SC) is an evolving collection of methodologies, which aims to exploit tolerance for imprecision, uncertainty, and partial truth to achieve robustness, tractability, and low total cost. It differs from conventional hard computing in that it is strongly based on intuition or subjectivity. Therefore, soft computing provides an attractive opportunity to represent the ambiguity in human thinking with real life uncertainty. Fuzzy logic (FL), neural networks (NN), and evolutionary computation (EC) are the core methodologies of soft computing. However, FL, NN, and EC should not be viewed as competing with each other, but synergistic and complementary instead. In this paper, we discuss the role of soft computing in developing innovative features for home appliances. Such development work is particularly active in Japan and South Korea. In those Asian countries even ordinary consumers do appreciate the capabilities of SC in developing user-friendly products with high machine IQ. Although home appliance technology is not a popular academic research area, it is an important application area for soft computing methods.},

  abstract={Enormous future investments are needed to replace old energy systems/technologies, and prepare them for future needs. Moreover, smarter technologies/systems are needed. And in this ever more complex, interconnected, and uncertain world, smarter policymaking in the energy field is certainly needed too. After all, current energy policymaking still mainly ignores (dynamic) complexity and (deep) uncertainty. This paper illustrates two model-based approaches for supporting policymaking for complex and uncertain issues as well as their combination. First, Exploratory System Dynamics Modeling and Analysis allows exploring and analyzing millions of plausible (uncertain) dynamic system behaviors and testing the robustness of policies. This approach is illustrated by means of a System Dynamics simulation model related to energy grid investments. Second, Experiential Model-Based Gaming allows policymakers to experience dynamic complexity and deep uncertainty, and helps them feel the need to embrace both in policymaking. Before having experienced different plausible futures, almost all high-level managers and highly-educated students that played such experiential games applied inappropriate strategies in most plausible futures played, and hence failed in the face of uncertainty. Failing repeatedly actually prepared them for thinking outside their old/reactive/predictive modes in subsequent bounce-casting sessions. Exploratory System Dynamics Modeling and Analysis and Experiential Model-Based Gaming may also be mutually beneficial: most subjects only acknowledge the need to take uncertainty and dynamic complexity seriously into account after having participated in experience-oriented gaming sessions.},

With the continuous development of global information construction in recent years, the types and quantities of information stored in databases are increasing. Implementing high-speed query response to massive database storage resources through hardware-level optimization design has become an important research direction in related fields. Aiming at the key problems such as low efficiency and high delay existing in the process of performing aggregation operation in the current mainstream database, this paper thorough analysis the principles and key steps of database execution of aggregation queries, and a new FPGA-based database aggregation query accelerator is designed using heterogeneous thinking. The accelerator is designed according to the actual application scenario of relational database aggregation query, and implements the aggregation grouping strategy based on hash algorithm and five commonly used aggregation functions through FPGA; In order to maximize processing efficiency and fully utilize the excellent parallel processing capabilities of FPGA, this study also optimizes the existing aggregation query architecture and proposes a decentralized multi-core collaborative aggregation query architecture to meet the needs of single time period and multithreaded queries. The aggregation query experiments on ZNBase, an open source database platform, show that the proposed database aggregation query accelerator based on FPGA is 21.71 times more efficient than the traditional software algorithm to realize the aggregation query scheme.},

  abstract={Minecraft is one of the most popular games among youth today, experiencing sales over 100 million worldwide and channels on YouTube generating over 47 billion views. Our interest in the game environment is due to its innate computational mechanics that integrate logic, design, and scripting elements. Because of these traits, many organizations and schools are looking to incorporate Minecraft into their curriculum to support computational thinking and computational practices. However, there are challenges surrounding the distribution and availability of individuals who possess the technical and computational expertise needed to support these opportunities. In this poster we introduce the DYN Minecraft Server project. The project is designed to address barriers of entry for adults at schools and youth-serving organizations who want to provide computing-related learning opportunities to diverse youth. We worked with families, city organizations, mentors, and youth to modify the commercially available Minecraft to support adults who may have limited expertise in computing or Minecraft, yet wish to use the platform in order to teach computational content The modifications include the integration of an information network that promotes STEM learning opportunities that are available throughout the city. We discuss our design process, designed activities and interfaces, and feedback from youth, partners, and mentors using the system.},

  title={Combining the Attention Network and Semantic Representation for Chinese Verb Metaphor Identification}, 
  year={2019},

  pages={137103-137110},
  abstract={Metaphor is the central issue of language and thinking. Metaphor identification plays a significant preliminary role in the field of machine translation, reading comprehension, and automatic summarization, making it a focus of natural language processing. Recently, research into Chinese verb metaphor identification has become a widespread concern. The main problem is that the usage of semantic resources is relatively simple, and there is a lack of deep semantic support. Therefore, this paper proposes a word representation method suitable for metaphor classification tasks, which combines the traditional word vector with structural information from the Synonym Thesaurus, so that the word vector can contain the abstraction degree of the word in the metaphor. On this basis, we propose a verb metaphor attention network based on subject-predicate and verb-object relationships, which gives full consideration to the global syntactic information when we perform LSTM encoding and calculate the weight of each word. At the same time, it can facilitate the understanding of literalness and non-literalness. The experimental results show that the identification effect improves on the existing results, indicating that word representation combining semantic resources and attention network can improve the verb metaphor identification performance.},

  abstract={Identifying defects at different scales is a challenge in industrial defect detection. To solve this problem, many multi-scale feature fusion networks have been proposed to improve multi-scale target detection accuracy by fusing fine-grained information from shallow networks and semantic information from deep networks. This approach requires the introduction of extraÂ parameters. Thinking from another perspective, can the accuracy of multi-scale target detection be improved by fusing the feature information under different receptive fields? For this purpose, we designed a three-layer network structure called Trident-LK Net. our model uses convolutional kernels of different sizes (31, 25, 1) in the feature extraction phase and establishes cross-fusion connections. This omits the feature fusion part and greatly reduces the network parameters while obtaining a good detection accuracy. Finally we perform experiments on the neu-det dataset and the gc10 dataset to verify the feasibility of our idea. While keeping the number of parameters to a minimum, our model achieves competitive detection results on the neu-det dataset (76.9% mAP) and optimal on the gc10 dataset (63.55% mAP). Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/syyang2022/Trident-LK-Net.},

  abstract={Humans have rich experience applying linear models and logical thinking, but only experts understand the behaviour of non-linear systems. However, the deep neural network (DNN) implementation of text non-linear systems outperforms optimal linear models. Therefore, the forward DNN (the pattern recognition system in this paper) attracts attention to the necessity of interpreting the results obtained by DNN. To preserve the high performance of DNN, we focus on a post-hoc explanation; this approach means building an explainable model for the decision obtained by the black box. To avoid the interpretation of a set of millions of non-linear functions, we divide DNN into two parts: the feature extractor and the classifier. Following that, we argue for a specific interpretation of each of them. While for classifiers, we have several suitable explainable models (and we decided on the fuzzy logical function), we believe that feature interpretation is a creative scientific activity corresponding to the usual research. The paper presents a tool to help researchers and users understand extracted features not necessarily known in the specific application domain. Explaining the new features offers a way to learn from computers.},

  pages={114061-114070},
  abstract={Aiming at the problems of small target and low recognition accuracy of high-speed railway contact network hanging chord defects, this paper proposes a target detection algorithm for hanging chord defects based on YOLOv5. To enhance the original YOLOv5 algorithm, the MobielNetv3 module was used as the efficient and lightweight backbone feature extraction network. Depth-separable convolution was adopted instead of standard convolution, reducing the number of network parameters by  $2\times 10 ^{6}$  and increasing detection speed by 23%. Introducing BiFPN feature pyramid structure with fusion of different feature layers in neck network improves detection accuracy by 0.4%. Adding CBAM attention mechanism at the prediction end improves the feature extraction ability of the model for small target images, which further improves the detection accuracy by 0.5%. The loss function CIoU was improved to Focal EIoU in order to solve the problems of unbalanced sample datasets and vanishing IoU gradients during the training process. The experimental results exhibit that the improved algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 98.5% on the dataset, a 39% enchancment in model detection speed and a 28% reduction in model parameters, verifying that the algorithm has the advantages of high recognition accuracy and fast detection speed. It can effectively solve the technical difficulties in the detection of defects in the existing contact network suspension chords, and provides a new way of thinking for intelligent railway inspection.},

  title={Securing Consumer Electronics Devices: A Blockchain-Based Access Management Approach Enhanced by Deep Learning Threat Modeling for IoT Ecosystems}, 
  year={2024},

  pages={110671-110680},
  abstract={Securing user electronics devices has become a significant concern in the digital period, and a forward-thinking solution covers the fusion of blockchain (BC) technology and deep learning (DL) methods. Blockchain improves device safety by transforming access management, storing credentials on a tamper-resistant ledger, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access and giving a robust defence against malevolent actors. Integrating DL into this framework also raises safety measures, as it permits devices to inspect and regulate to develop attacks distinctly. DL models accurately recognize intricate designs and anomalies, allowing the technique to distinguish and threaten possible attacks in real time. The fusion of BC and DL not only improves the reliability of user electronics but also establishes a dynamic and adaptive safety system, enhancing consumer confidence in the safety of their devices. Therefore, this study presents a BC-Based Access Management with DL Threat Modeling (BCAM-DLTM) technique for securing consumer electronics devices in the IoT ecosystems. The BCAM-DLTM technique mainly follows a two-phase procedure: access management and threat detection. Moreover, BC technology can be applied to the access management of consumer electronics devices. Besides, the BCAM-DLTM technique applies a deep belief networks (DBNs) model for proficiently identifying threats. To enhance the recognition results of the DBN model, the hyperparameter tuning procedure uses the reptile search algorithm (RSA). The experimental outcome study of the BCAM-DLTM approach employs the NSLKDD dataset. The comprehensive results of the BCAM-DLTM approach portrayed a superior accuracy outcome of 99.63% over existing models in terms of distinct metrics.},

  title={Cognitive Dynamic System for Control and Cyber-Attack Detection in Smart Grid}, 
  year={2019},
  volume={7},
  number={},
  pages={78320-78335},
  abstract={This paper introduces a new way of thinking that characterizes itself by uniting two entities, namely state estimation in the smart grid (SG) and cognitive dynamic system (CDS). False data injection (FDI) attacks are a family of new attacks that have been considered to be the most dangerous cyber-attack as it leads to cascaded bad decision making throughout the SG network, which can lead to severe repercussions. The conventional state estimation and bad data detection techniques, which have been applied to reduce observation errors and detect bad data in energy system state estimators, cannot detect FDI attacks. Here, we bring into play an objective-seeking system to act as the supervisor of the SG network. To this end, we propose to introduce a new metric for the SG: the entropic state. The entropic state has two purposes: 1) it provides an indication of the grid's health on a cycle-to-cycle basis and 2) it can be used to detect FDI attacks. Consequently, improving the entropic state is the goal of the supervisor. To achieve that objective, the supervisor dynamically optimizes the state estimation process by reconfiguring the weights of the sensors in the network. With optimality in mind, the CDS is the superior choice for the supervisory system. In this structure, the CDS interacts with the SG network, which is considered as the environment. Computer simulations are carried out on a 4-bus and the IEEE 14-bus systems to highlight the performance of the proposed approach in detecting both bad data and FDI attacks in the SG, respectively.},

  pages={81205-81223},
  abstract={The accomplishment of blockchain has increased the focus on the various applications for simplifying the confidentiality and transaction sanctuary using the decentralized architecture via consensus mechanisms between different internet of things (IoT) nodes in daily increasing societal areas. The growth of blockchain lasted to grow and used to do compare technologies. The major shortcomings of blockchain is the lack of scalability in modern application settings. Holochain technology vends itself as a “thinking” exterior to blocks, and it is a peer-to-peer disseminated ledger technology. It works contrarily compared to the blockchain, and it offers an exclusive value in the existing market. IoT devices are continuously used in distributed environments, in various smart applications. The peer-to-peer IoT networks, connected to smart agricultural systems are exposed to the security issues. Specifically, the personal data of agricultural land records need protection against unauthorized access and eradicate corruption in land transactions. The Blockchain offers a possible solution based on distributed ledger, but it has scalability issues due to high storage and processing requirements with growing network size. Also data is not locally stored in a Blockchain. This paper studies the conventions of holochain technology, its architecture and challenges, and critical mechanisms of holochain applications. We also analyze the numerous models utilized for the implementation of protected transactions. We discuss an agent centric framework with distributed hash table for secured applications.},
