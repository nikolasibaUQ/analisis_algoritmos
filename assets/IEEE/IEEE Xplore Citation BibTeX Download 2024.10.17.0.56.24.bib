  abstract={Augmented Reality (AR), a unique method of integrating the virtual world into the real world, has the potential to increase academic attainment in the classroom. This research work focuses on developing and evaluating a strategy for enhancing student education with AR in the classroom. AR enables unique human-computer interactions in real time between the physical and digital worlds. The effectiveness of AR in the classroom will depend on its development, deployment, and integration into both standard and nontraditional teaching environments. Throughout the creation and implementation of an AR classroom, collaborative learning practices and other methodologies were taken into account. Collaboration occurs when two or more individuals work together, share information, and gain insights from one another. This research offers a succinct summary of the promise and challenges of adopting AR to transform the classroom.},

  year={2023},

  number={2},
  pages={1463-1477},
  abstract={Spreadsheet-based tools provide a simple yet effective way of calculating values, which makes them the number-one choice for building and formalizing simple models for budget planning and many other applications. A cell in a spreadsheet holds one specific value and gives a discrete, overprecise view of the underlying model. Therefore, spreadsheets are of limited use when investigating the inherent uncertainties of such models and answering what-if questions. Existing extensions typically require a complex modeling process that cannot easily be embedded in a tabular layout. In Fuzzy Spreadsheet, a cell can hold and display a distribution of values. This integrated uncertainty-handling immediately conveys sensitivity and robustness information. The fuzzification of the cells enables calculations not only with precise values but also with distributions, and probabilities. We conservatively added and carefully crafted visuals to maintain the look and feel of a traditional spreadsheet while facilitating what-if analyses. Given a user-specified reference cell, Fuzzy Spreadsheet automatically extracts and visualizes contextually relevant information, such as impact, uncertainty, and degree of neighborhood, for the selected and related cells. To evaluate its usability and the perceived mental effort required, we conducted a user study. The results show that our approach outperforms traditional spreadsheets in terms of answer correctness, response time, and perceived mental effort in almost all tasks tested.},

  year={2023},
  volume={11},

  pages={116011-116025},
  abstract={Cloud computing is a technology for efficiently using computing infrastructures and a business model for selling computing resources and services. However, intruders find such complex and distributed infrastructures appealing targets for cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks are severe threats that can jeopardize the quality of service provided to clients and compromise data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Cyber-attacks are becoming more complex, making it more challenging to detect intrusions effectively. Due to the high traffic and increased malicious activities on the Internet, a single Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be overwhelmed. Despite the various Deep Learning (DL) approaches that have been proposed as alternative solutions, there are still pertinent security issues to be addressed especially in federated cloud computing domains. This work proposes a Secure Federated Intrusion Detection Model Version 1 (SecFedIDM-V1) using blockchain technology and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The Cobourg Intrusion Detection Dataset (CIDDS) was acquired, pre-processed and split into 60:20:20, 70:15:15, and 80:10:10 for training, testing, and validation respectively to develop the proposed intrusion traffic classification component of the proposed model. The developed SecFedIDM-V1 was later deployed as a Python-based web application that captures network packets for classifying attacks into normal or an attack type. The attack packets are recorded in a Hyperledger Fabric (a private blockchain technology) to serve as a signature database to be used by other nodes in the network. From the evaluation results of the intrusion classifier, the 80:10:10 BiLSTM network performed better than GRU with a Precision of 0.99624, Recall of 0.99906, F1 Score of 0.99614, False Positive Rate (FPR) of 0.00094, False Negative Rate (FNR) of 0.00395 and True Positive Rate (TPR) of 0.99605. The SecFedIDM-V1 can be deployed alongside Firewalls in a federated cloud computing environment to reinforce the security of the infrastructure.},

  abstract={Story Generation through Deep Learning is a fascinating area of research in Artificial Intelligence that aims to create computer systems that can produce original and compelling narratives and is an interesting concept that has flourished in the domain of Machine Learning applications starting from 2018. Most of the research carried out in this specific area has shown advances in Modelling and efficiency of story generation. However, some of the setbacks in Artificial Story Generation include little to no coherency with human generating pattern, tokens/words limitation, missing plot twists and direction of story. In this paper, we have performed a comparative study on Automatic Story Generation as well as the proposed scheme of this paper has main focus on generating a meaningful story with the help of conditional text generation using keywords upto five hundred words by optimizing hugging face generative pre trained model Version Two catering towards the problem of coherency in the text generated.

  abstract={Computer science as a discipline encompasses the study and creation of computational techniques for problem-solving. Unfortunately, much of the benefit of these techniques to engineering students is lost in translation, in part due to the disconnect between introductory computing courses and the disciplinary courses that introduce problems that could benefit from computational techniques. A considerable body of literature has documented the ineffectiveness of traditional programming courses in transferring usable knowledge to students, specifically where problem-solving skills and computational thinking are concerned. This paper describes a transformative change to the instruction of introductory computing to engineering students, in the context of a single non-major course. In the proposed architecture, a core lecture is supplemented with plug-in domain-specific modules and problems that are presented in domain-specific recitation/laboratory sections. The focus of the lecture component of the course is to introduce the core concepts and skills required for computational thinking, including algorithms and software engineering techniques. The recitation/laboratory component encourages and guides the application of these skills to introductory problems in engineering. The objective is to shift the emphasis from the minutia of the syntax of textual programming languages to computational thinking.},

  abstract={In order to study various aspects of students' understanding of atomic orbitals, we have built a 3D virtual environment - "Virtual Water" - to support the learning of some concepts of physics and chemistry at the final high school or first-year university levels. It focuses on the microscopic structure of water and explores, among others, concepts related to atomic and molecular orbitals. To evaluate that software, we have made a qualitative study with 20 first-year students of science and engineering courses at the university of Coimbra, Portugal. Having been asked to describe their views about how they conceive electrons in an atom before seeing "Virtual Water", students revealed some misconceptions. We have tried, with partial success, to overcome them by making students explore our virtual environment.},

Through information visualization tools, we aim to provide feedback to patients to encourage behavior change. The system has two core building blocks: (1) Data analysis combining several statistical and machine learning models, founded under different principles and assumptions, into a single meta-model for predicting compliance behavior. The aim is to create superior models for behavior prediction - knowledge that can then be translated into patient-centered decision-support tools. (2) Incorporating data analysis and visualization enabling datasets to be turned into knowledge utilities that can intelligently interact with participants by alerting them to any interesting correlations within the data. Such tools could provide feedback indicating, for example, a high-risk to medication non-compliance behavior in which case appropriate resources could be directed to those who need help the most.},

  abstract={The Black Box is a system with the internal organization and behavior about which the observer has no information. However, it is possible to impact the whole system via its inputs and observe its reactions via its outputs. The paper is concerned with the implementation of “black box” type of activities to teach computational thinking. The main idea is to give the students the puzzles and ask them to “play” with the inputs and observe the outputs enough to determine the internal mechanisms or principles that produce particular outputs from given inputs. First year students were asked to define a formula or describe a principle, based on which the input transforms itself into the output. There were four different types of answers: the student could be able (1) to state a formal proof, (2) to state a verbal proof, (3) to state a basic concept of algorithms, or (4) not to state any type of correct solution. We found out that a lot of the students were not able to think about the concept of the application functioning and were not able to create any formal description of algorithms.},

  abstract={The human mind is a truly remarkable thing that does so much that we are not even aware of. Controlling machines using the concept of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a practical method that opens the way to a fully synchronized method between human thoughts and controlled objects. Using BCI to control a drone will open the way toward smooth and high-response flight. Deep learning is a new-age skill that has made many breakthroughs and influenced modern technologies. It has made it possible to predict and identify even the most complex and abstract patterns that even we humans would be very challenged to catch ourselves. In this paper, a method of controlling a drone using BCI has been presented using an 8-channel Electroencephalogram (EEG) headset. Deep learning has been employed to process and classify human brain waves. After testing the resulting deep learning algorithm, the overall classification accuracy was 90% to distinguish between four different movements of the drone.},

  abstract={Computer Science contains many abstract concepts, which are both difficult to teach, and to comprehend. Many attempts have been made to help students learn these concepts through visualizations and various teaching techniques; however, these methods are mostly limited to the classroom and do not allow the student time to fully explore the concepts by themselves. By enabling students to interact with the material at their own pace, through an easily accessible and dynamic learning environment, students should be better able to retain and understand the concepts of Computer Science. Binary Search Tree (BST) is an abstract concept which can easily be converted into an interactive format suitable for student self-learning. To see whether an interactive format enhances students learning, a web-based prototype was created. The game consists of forming links between orbs, selecting orbs, copying orbs and removing orbs. This allows for all operations of Binary Search Trees to be explored while presenting the concept in a simple manner. As operations are preformed, and links are made, pseudocode is highlighted in the information menu as a way to reinforce learning and provide context to the operations. In order to measure the effectiveness of the prototype, a pre-survey and a post survey are integrated into the web application.},

  abstract={The system aims to direct the user to create their network system collaboratively for a case of Covid-19 health throughout a case study in a Web System and E-Commerce course. The framework of directed health learning is based on 7x2C content knowledge established criteria to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the system. The self-design frame framework is plan-oriented and based on the concept of a plan and plans integrations and special relationships. The user is directed to break the system into plans and the design is to self-guide the user to build a system to comprehend, combat, coexist, cope, and trace COVID-19 with four layers of diagnostics, simulation, and pattern matching database. With the collaboration of users' systems, a fact from one user as output can be transferred to another user as an input in a circulation forming a general fact. Consequently, the transfer of learning from one system flows into another system resulting in a pattern to be found. Based on the pattern an algorithm will formulate to tackle a solution to COVID19. The implication of this study will be a guideline for others to initiate their own participant's system to find a pattern and formulate an algorithm for the pandemic. The idea of self-design and self-directed learning can be transferred to other fields of study covid-19 health. At present time, a parallel case study of goods and services on farming of Sunchoke plant has been directed with three plan themes of Grow, Eat, and Heal.)},

  abstract={Educational robotics provides an interdisciplinary approach to STEM, computer science, and 21stcentury skill acquisition for students of all ages. Robotics can increase student perceptions of STEM subjects as well as foundational skills through an engaging and authentic learning environment. However, the many benefits of robotics for students and teachers are dependent on the curriculum. In this paper we describe how using the Understanding by Design pedagogical framework supports the development of truly integrated and interdisciplinary educational robotics curriculum. Two examples are provided for a virtual robot that showcase this pedagogical approach for combining STEM, art, and programming in an authentic manner.},

  abstract={A process of data acquisition and analysis of text files for the purpose of following the insurgence and growth of words in the English language is reported. Pitfalls that were encountered and the solutions that were found to these problems are also discussed. The question of whether the Zipf-Mandelbrot law applies to the distribution of words in a language over time is examined. Several other results and future research ideas are discussed.},
