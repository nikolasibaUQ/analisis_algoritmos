  abstract={Problems involving human activity systems contain a soft element which makes them hard to resolve using traditional approaches. Teaching programming is no difference in this regard. The presence of numerous factors makes it a complex and messy situation. However, one key contributor to this problem is the differences in perception of the parties involved. This paper aims to analyze the problem of teaching programming within a computer science department at Omar Elmukhtar University (OMU) through the application of soft system methodology SSM, in addition to investigating the effects and benefits of using such an approach in order to suggest a solution. Through constructing a root definition and conceptual model, we were able to provide a standard to which the current organization can be compared against, and therefore, achieve a better understanding regarding which changes need to be carried out in order to attain the system's desired results.},

  title={From breadboard to complex electronic systems - introducing a heterogenous group of undergrad students to design and analysis of electronic circuits}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This practice work-in-progress paper describes an innovative laboratory course designed to introduce a heterogenous cohort of undergraduate students from various fields of engineering and science to the principles of designing and analyzing complex electronic systems. The course utilizes a self-developed drum machine as a visual and acoustic project with a gradually increasing level of complexity throughout the lab sessions. Through active participation students acquire an understanding of SPICE simulations, test & measurement equipment, and printed circuit board (PCB) assembly. The course is mandatory for students pursuing a bachelor's degree in electrical, mechatronic, biomedical, computational, and information system engineering, and is also attended as an optional module by computer science and physics students. In the winter term of 2022, the course returned to the lab after the COVID-19 pandemic and was attended by more than 200 students. The laboratory experiments are supported by complementary activities, such as SPICE simulations of the circuits as preparation, and lab reports written in LaTeX to introduce the students to scientific writing. Instructional videos and consultation hours are offered to assist with SPICE simulation and LaTeX. During the physical lab sessions, students work in groups of three in a traditional laboratory environment, with student tutors available to provide guidance offered in the form of minimal help. Overall, the presented lab course is an innovative and engaging method of teaching electronic systems. The self-developed drum machine provides a visually and audibly stimulating project, allowing students to learn practical skills and develop their theoretical knowledge.},

This can help the learners who understand definitions of the concepts poorly. We present two visual simulators for demonstrating concept properties and domain laws, implemented as web applications. They can be used to study programming, enabling trial-and-error learning, supported by the error messages, explaining why the user's action was wrong.},

  pages={123-126},
  abstract={Mobile programming is one of the fastest growing approaches in many fields, such as marketing or e-commerce. From the educational perspective, this means that students should understand that they can build mobile applications (apps) without being professionals, and at the same time recognize their own potential to use technology in any professional path they choose. This goal is not trivial, even if students are in general curious and open to learn about the creation of apps. Indeed, especially in liberal education, students get discouraged upfront as they perceive programming as a difficult task. This paper describes a course that was cre- ated to fit the educational needs of a social-economic high school. Students take part of an interdisciplinary project in which the Software Engineering process is used to promote CT skills. The course was repeated twice and involved 29 students (8th and 9th grade).},

  abstract={Studies indicate that students, particularly females, find computing most engaging when it is presented in relation to real-life problems, rather than when it is presented in ways that emphasize computing for the sake of computing. Video scenarios are a novel tool for encouraging students to explore computing in a problem-centric, rather than a code-centric, manner. Video scenarios are short films (2-5 minutes long) that depict individuals facing problems in life-like settings. The scenarios emphasize the diverse and often ill-defined nature of real world problems, and the potential for creative and entrepreneurial computing they present. The video scenarios and their associated discussion/exercise questions are freely available on the web at www.Virt-U.org.},

  abstract={Students in sophomore computer science (ldquoCS 2rdquo) are required to study the properties of a number of standard data structures; that is, common patterns of organizing data in a computer program. Typically, students are first presented with diagrams that graphically depict the data structure, and then shown sample code that actually implements it. We have observed, however, that there is a sizable gap between these two representations, and that many students who master the former have great difficulty translating that knowledge into the latter. We suspect that our pedagogy could be made more effective by treating diagrams themselves as formal entities, and providing students with a way of mapping operations on the ldquoeasyrdquo (pictorial) domain into the ldquohardrdquo (programmatic) domain. To help develop this technique, we carried out a semester-long experiment in which students demonstrated their understanding of the material both in diagrams and in code. The goal was to ascertain the kinds of mistakes that are often made, and how a technique like this could be most effective.},

  abstract={The adoption of technologies such as tablets or smartphones for children at home or at school is one of the most recent trends in today’s world. This challenges for suitable teaching methodologies and practices, along with oriented learning contents for such devices. On the one hand, teachers and tutors may acquire skills and competences to cope with gadgets and its technologies. On the other hand, learners must be versatile onto a complementary and complex environment in which the virtual meets the traditional lectures. Moreover, when the learning ecosystem includes children and younger newbies with technologies and gadgets is promising the adoption of targeted approaches such as gamification, playful activities and/or high interactive and supportive learning. This study presents the introduction of game-based learning techniques for young children at Cape Verde, with 17 students aged from 4 to 11 years, using the Code Karts app. Pre- and post-assessments measured familiarity with technology, appeal of the coding app, ability to play Code Karts, conceptual understanding of coding, and in-class behaviours. Results revealed that children prefer haptic interfaces to interact with technological devices. Congruently, the adoption of mobile phones and tablets was easier at the expense of the use of laptops. In addition, the proposed learning methodology, based on gamification principles, was determinant to promote in-class interaction and tutor-children interaction. In addition, gamification was crucial for the learning outcomes and to provide insight on programming. Complementary studies must be addressed aiming at to evaluate the long term effect on children due to the adoption of programming activities in the classroom.},

  abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed rapid and significant changes upon education systems. Most educational institutions transferred abruptly from traditional face-to-face delivery to distance learning formats through virtual classrooms. As a result of this shift, many faculty members have faced challenges in keeping their students engaged during lectures. Gamification is often proposed as a promising solution to enhance student motivation, engagement, and learning outcomes attainment. This study investigates the effectiveness of the gamification mechanism on undergraduate students in a computer programming course using Kahoot! and Nearpod during distance learning. The findings of the study show that there is some correlation between student engagement, learning motivation, academic performance, and the use of gamification.},

  abstract={Design of new strategies according to game models has been a general approach from the start. There are numerous games and each game has a different set of rules and different set of strategies for playing them. Though the design model of the game is similar to a set of particular games of the same domain, still we have to have a different strategic model for every individual game. The strategy design for these games also has to be different. Hence the paper proposes a new model for the design of game strategy by generalising the approach. Virtual generation of various strategies with the inter-application of basic strategies and complex strategies from various set of games into one another is the proposed algorithm. This gives a new approach entirely to the modelling of game strategies. It does so with the help of trained networks which are dynamically created and virtually maintained. This paper proposes a entire new approach in game modelling; more generalized and a more integrated approach.},

  pages={184-188},
  abstract={This paper presents the design of a browser-based Arduino programming tool and learning management system (LMS), CASMM, that offers end-to-end support for learners utilizing Chromebooks in a classroom environment. This tool aims to support learners through the entire process of coding and using Arduinos in group projects at scale in formal classrooms. The novelty of this tool and its discussion for the VL/HCC community lies in the design and customization of this tool to meet real world constraints of formal classrooms. In addition, it encourages expansion of who we consider users and requires inclusion of where and how learning takes place to truly support human-centered development of programming tools. In this paper, we shift the focus from individual users to multiple groups of student users and 1–3 teachers/mentors in a classroom environment. In particular, this paper aims to make explicit the unique needs of teachers and students who may have limited technology expertise both in coding and using Arduinos in formal classroom environments, the human and technological constraints of a formal classroom and features we've designed into CASMM to address these needs. Through this paper, we aim to spark discussion about the human-centered requirements of these users and how tools that support learners end-to-end in the development process may be necessary to truly provide accessible programming languages and environments for a wide range of novices (i.e., students, classroom teachers, and college mentors/volunteers).},

  abstract={The “Scratch4All” project aims to reduce school dropout rates by encouraging and motivating students in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd cycles of elementary schools to achieve academic success. In addition, the project promotes true equality of opportunity in terms of educational resources. A learning environment that contributes positively to the improvement of educational results is created through the use of new technologies, specifically programming in the Scratch language and robotics. Impact indicators were developed and used as project evaluation tools based on Theory of Change. This paper presents and analyzes the changes observed from the perspective of the project’s teachers’ stakeholders during the 2020/2021 school year. This group of beneficiaries is critical to the project’s success and continuation, not only because of the special relationship they have with the students, but also with their families and the school. The assessment of impact is very positive in terms of indicators such as school success and motivation, particularly in Mathematics and Portuguese Language, as well as in the reduction of inequalities, access to new technologies, and contribution to gender equality.},

  abstract={Multicluster Grid has emerged as a major approach for people to pursue substantial computational capability improvement to support large-scale compute-intensive applications. However, it is challenging on how to efficiently manage application execution across the participating clusters, since the participating clusters are geographically distributed, heterogeneous, and self-administrative, and the network connection provided by the Internet is vulnerable in security and unpredictable in performance. The challenges include how to discover resource information, how to handle application workflow, how to allocate appropriate resources, how to make application execution reliable to endure system failures, etc. This paper proposes cluster abstraction to uniform describe and access resources in multicluster Grid. After investigating various cluster resource management systems, a reference description of cluster abstraction is presented to cover cluster computing characteristics, hiding individual cluster details for use. Following this concept, a deployment service is discussed. This deployment service is one of the essential components in ongoing resource management development for multicluster Grids.},

ABGIS provides a powerful simulation tool and an envyronment that is an excelent metaphor to represent our spatio-temporal world. With ABGIS we could explore the dynamics of spatio-temporal systems, particularly, but not exclusively, complex systems. It is possible to simulate complex systems having as a starting point only simple elements (agents), embedded in some type of environment. These agents can inter-act which each other in only specific and very simple ways. As the result of the interaction among the agents and the environment, the behavior of the complex system at macrocosmic level then emerges. According this line of thinking, there are a lot of social, biological, and ecological processes that can be simulated by agent-based models [1],[2]. In this article we give a general description of the desirable capabilities of ABSGIS, describing some features it should incorporate, and presenting some examples that could explore this kind of tool.},

The emergence of co-design, with its wide range of applications, has drawn various participants for discussion and exploration. Abundant and diverse information has been attained as a result. With an expansion of design domain and research form, however, the direction of contemporary design research has already transformed from production of artifact to a focus on integration of varied knowledge and fields at different stages. This research is based on two heterogeneous case studies, with different research methods, in an attempt to solve the complexity of design and meet the needs of users.

  abstract={Some complex problems in the computational area are learning programming and algorithms. Authoring system is a subject that can be considered as complex as it integrates the use of scripting language like Action Script in Flash, Active Server Pages (ASP) and Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP). The normal problem that resides when it comes to programming is handling error as it is not an easy task and for those who are new, might find this very troublesome. Handling the error requires proper planning and skills in analyzing problem which students usually lack at. Reflection in learning is really helpful in helping students learn the Authoring System subject effectively as they are encourage to share ideas, experiences and perspective actively on the emerging issues of Action Script topic especially in discussing the concepts and errors. With the need for reflection in developing the required skills in learning Authoring System, how then do we ensure and measure the quality in student reflection journals and its contact in assessing the subject content and students' performance in learning? Quality is defined as "processes or outcomes" [1]. In the context of this research study, quality is determined by assessing the progression of reflective processes based on the interventions given. As an educator, we need to be aware on how new technologies act as the engagers and facilitators in the reflection purposes. Blog is one of the emerging technologies that can offer such pedagogical benefits as reflective tools and social affordances across disciplines provided that one can read and make comments that lead to meaningful discussion for common interests and individual differences [2]. Although blogging enable deep reflection in each individual blogs, somehow it failed to encourage peer feedback to each other blogs and collaboration among students to support reflective thinking as expected [3]. This problem exists probably due to the minimum used of blog technical features and also the absence of activities and guidelines to elevate collaborative reflection process to take place [4]. Students' familiarity with the blog technology cannot guarantee them with the skills to use it efficiently in educational setting. They still need further expose and training on how technologies can be used beyond the technological sake [4]. Besides the use of blogs, the design of the activities should not simply indicate the progress towards the solution of the problem if to allow reflective thinking to occur. The use of case-based learning can support reflective thinking among students in learning computer-based subject. However, the implementation of case-based learning requires the presence of an instructor to guide students to solve the subject matter at hand. Instructors are therefore encouraged to regulate students thinking by integrating the metacognitive strategies in learning necessary for academic success and students should also be granted with the opportunity in using this strategy to boost the likely for students to reflect on their task and therefore contributed to their experience as a community of learners. Unfortunately, many students failed to directly engage in metacognitive thinking unless they are shown ways to do so through prudently designed instructional activities. Thus, it is vital to embed metacognitive support in the design of learning environment especially when dealing with computer education subject which involves lots of technical aspects. This study believes that the integrations of several approaches as mentioned above can granted a green light in nurturing and achieving good quality in students' reflection. In this study, the quality is heavily relied on the use of feedback either from the instructors to students or among students themselves. Most of studies regarding the reflection done before only focusing on rating students' reflection journals all alone without considering other factors that may impacting certain levels of reflection. Therefore, this study is intended to identify the impact of provision of feedback in determining the quality of students' reflection and predicting the students' performance in learning Authoring System subject. This study will employ a quantitative research design which involves the use of pre-experimental design of one group pretest-posttest type. It will be conducted in one whole semester and will involve postgraduate students who registered for Authoring System subject. Three research instruments will be used in this study: questionnaires, performance test, and student's reflection in blogs. 1. Questionnaire: -There will be two questionnaires administered in this research study. The first questionnaire is about students' perceptions regarding the educational benefits of reflection through blogging while the second questionnaire is about the students' perceptions regarding the provision of feedback both from the peers and instructors. Both questionnaires are self-developed by the researchers and will be analyzed using the Rasch Model analysis technique which is run using Win steps software. By using Rasch Model, the findings will be more interesting and meaningful as from the students' psychometrics, researchers are able to dig into detail about the real relations between students and the measureable items. 2. Performance test: -The performance test is consists of several questions on Authoring System which cover the topic on Flash and Dreamweaver. It will be administered at the last session of the semester and is graded based on the answer scheme. The performance score will later be used in data mining analysis technique through Weka software in order to predict student's performance based on the pattern of reflection among students in learning the aforementioned subject. 3. Observations and analysis of students' reflections in blogs: -Throughout the semester, student's blogs will be monitored in order to observe their activities and to encourage them to do the reflection critically. Apart from the weekly reflections, several minicases activities will be posted in the instructor's blog and students are required to make critical reflections on each mini case. The minicase is designed to help students to apply concepts and suitable for practical in lab settings [5]. The cases will be created based on real-life practices and also from the problems encountered by the students while completing the class activities. Students' postings in the blogs will be analyzed via content analysis technique. The qualitative postings from the blogs which originally in the form of text will be coded using the four levels of reflective thinking framework by [6] and this action will transformed the qualitative data into quantitative data in terms of the frequency of occurrence. In order to measure the quality of reflection, the following analyses will be taken into account [7]: 1. Overall frequency of posting given by instructors and students. 2. Nature of posting by instructors and students (answers, questions, or mix of both). 3. Timing of the posting (during or end of forum). 4. How the postings style evolve from one level of reflective thinking to another as a result of provision of feedback by instructors and students. The general outcome of doing reflection is learning. However, this study is expected to achieve more than that. The upshot of this study will determine the quality in students' reflection and also the dominant level of reflective thinking. The outcome will further validate similar studies which previously conducted concerning the reflective thinking skills with the integration of technology, pedagogical aspects of learning for active involvement and how the students' psychometrics from the developed questionnaires can addressed the crucial information about the way students gain information and learning.},

  abstract={The theme “personal data” is on the rise due to entry into force of the General Data Protection Law (LGPD), also known as law no. 13.709/2018, and deals with any relationship between the treatment of information classified as personal data by any means. This article aims to present the main concepts involving data privacy, the fundamentals of the LGPD and the tools and methods to assist in the implementation of the law. To verify the adequacy of organizations to LGPD in Brazil, a survey was carried out through a survey with 216 professionals from different market segments and regions. After the analysis of the survey results, it became clear that many companies are starting projects to adapt to the LGPD and that the internal structures are still small and deserve extra attention in the training of employees},

  abstract={A fluent ability to associate tasks, concepts, ideas, knowledge and experiences in a relevant way is often considered an important factor of creativity, especially in problem solving. We are interested in providing computational support for discovering such creative associations. In this paper we design minimally supervised methods that can perform well in the remote associates test (RAT), a well-known psychometric measure of creativity. We show that with a large corpus of text and some relatively simple principles, this can be achieved. We then develop methods for a more general word association model that could be used in lexical creativity support systems, and which also could be a small step towards lexical creativity in computers.},

  abstract={This Innovative Practice of a Full Paper presents new ways of teaching classes. The teaching methodology of the algorithm disciplines of the first years of Computer Engineering courses directly affects student performance throughout the course. The current education system is in transition, taking slow steps in new ways of learning. By promoting self-reflection and critical thinking, students can develop problem-solving skills and observe an application of the tools learned. A proposed methodology includes new structuring of the discipline "Algorithms and Data Structures I" at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande (FURG), with the learning of a modern programming language and the transformation of the classic classroom model to new methods and dynamics. Computational thinking is fundamental at the beginning of the course. From this, all students receive a introduction course at the beginning of the college year to immerse in dynamics to practice logic. Classes began, students received an extension to the basic learning of the discipline (the fundamentals of algorithms and Python as a modern programming language) and at the same time they received an assignment, a problem resolution, where they had space and time to develop a game with the theme of their choice. The activity requires teamwork and creativity. As lectures run as workshops, allowing collaboration and project creation, with the help of teachers and older students as tutors. To complete the program, an event made available by the university was used as an environment, for visitors, scholars as well for high school juniors interested in software, to attend and learn about. As a preliminary result of the new implementation methodology, after 4 years, there was an increase in the approval and average grade of learners.},
