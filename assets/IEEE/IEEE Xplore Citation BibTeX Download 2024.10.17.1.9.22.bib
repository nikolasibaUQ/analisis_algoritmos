  abstract={Communication has become a lot easier in this era of technology, development of high-speed computer networks, and the inexpensive uses of Internet. Therefore, data transmission has become vulnerable to and unsafe from different external attacks. Every communication body wants to secure their data while communicating over the Internet. The internet has various benefits but the main demerit is the privacy and security and the transmission of data over insecure network or channel may happen. Various techniques used for secure communication in order to address these issues, steganography plays an important role. Steganography is the process of obfuscation that makes something incomprehensible and unclear. Different image steganography research methods are proposed recently but each has their advantages and disadvantages and still have necessity to develop some better image steganography mechanisms to achieve the reliability between the basics criteria of image steganography. Therefore, the proposed work, in this paper, is based on the Least Significant Bit (LSB) substitution method. The LSB substitution method can minimize the error rate in embedding process and can achieve greater reliability in criteria, using novel algorithm based on value difference. In this paper, we proposed a novel technique in steganography within the digital images such is RGB, Gray Scale, Texture, Aerial images to achieve higher security, imperceptibility, capacity, and robustness as compared with existing methods. The experimental outcomes of the suggested approach prove further developed strength and justify the feasibility of our research. Through numerical simulations, we observed that the proposed strategy outperformed the next-best current methodology by 5.561 percent in terms of PSNR Correlation score. Additionally, the proposed approach achieved a 6.43 percent better score in PSNR with a variable measure of code inserted in similar images with distinct dimensions. Furthermore, encrypting the same amount of information in images of varying sizes resulted in approximately 6.77 percent improvements. Embedding different sizes of a particular secret message in a different image (such as Gray, Texture, Aerial and RGB images) came out with about 5.466 percent of better score.},

  abstract={Terengganu brassware is a local craft product with high artistic value and traditional craftsmanship that involves a lot of creativity and elaborate artistry. This cultural heritage is in danger of disappearing because the current younger generation lacks interest, creativity and artistic skills to continue the craftsmanship. Therefore, gathering detailed knowledge of the craft from ageing practitioners can preserve the heritage. This article reports the study on brassware intangible heritage knowledge base development using an ontological approach. The ontology modelling used Ontology Development 101. Content validation result by experts found that the brassware ontology is complete, consistent, concise, precise and clear. Evaluation results show that the experts agreed on content representation (mean ≥3.80), and the ontology meets all the quality criteria (mean ≥4.03). The brassware craft ontology contributes to the intangible heritage preservation effort for one of the almost extinct local culture and practices. This intangible heritage knowledge base can be applied for the development of semantic search, mobile and gaming applications to attract and disseminate heritage information to young people. Additionally, the ontological design can serve as a guide for the design and development of a knowledge base for other types of heritage.},

  title={Table-to-Dialog: Building Dialog Assistants to Chat With People on Behalf of You}, 
  year={2020},

  pages={102313-102320},
  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) personal assistant has attracted much attention from both academia and industry. Almost all existing AI personal assistants serve as service terminals to chat with human users for certain tasks. We are instead interested in building AI personal assistants for a different yet important dialog scenario, where they chat with people to fulfill specific tasks on behalf of their human users. As the personal assistants are playing a requester role, instead of a service terminal role, the conversation goal becomes delivering or requesting information according to specific user requests precisely and efficiently. The challenge for the conversation policy is that all user requests must be delivered precisely, while the challenge for the response generation is that it's generally expected for machine generated responses to cover multiple information slots, either requesting or delivering, to make the conversation efficient. In this paper, we present Table-to-Dialogue, a novel approach to address the above challenges when building a requester role AI personal assistant. We employ an encoder-decoder network to learn explicit conversation policy, which generates the corresponding information slots based on the conversation context and the user request table. We further integrate a novel Multi-Slot Constrained Bi-directional Decoder (MS-CBD) into the above encoder-decoder network, to generate machine response according to the multiple slot values and their intermediate representations from the policy decoder. Different from the existing single direction text decoder approaches, MS-CBD leverage the bi-directional context of the response when generating it to enhance the semantic coherence. The experiments shows that our approach significantly outperform the state-of-the-art conversation approaches on automatic and human evaluation metrics.},

  title={How Do Students Behave in a Gamified Course?—A Ten-Year Study},

  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={81008-81031},
  abstract={Gamified learning aims to motivate students using game elements. Although gamification can enhance students' enjoyment and engagement, it is unclear how different students behave in and interact with gamified contexts. To this end, we analyze how different students interact with a gamified course. We devised such an experimental course on Multimedia Content Production (MCP), and ran it for ten years. At each year, we modified it after students' feedback from the previous year. We determined student groups applying clustering techniques to learner performance data, independently analyzed the resulting clusters in terms of behavior, engagement, performance, and also compared those pairwise. Our analysis identified four different student groups (profiles/clusters) according to their performance and interactions with the course across all years. We found out that the best performing students were those that had significantly more interactions with course materials and consistently ranked highest. In addition, we found that performance indicators for students of all groups became stable within the first month after course start, allowing final grades to be predicted with high accuracy by then. Furthermore, all were deadline driven and became mainly active at the end of the semesters (indicating a lack of self-regulation skills). Moreover, we did not find any specific relation between students' groups and gaming profiles (Brainhex categories). Finally, we propose practical implications and guidelines for designing compelling gamified learning experiences.},

  pages={72988-73004},
  abstract={An increase in the number of cloud services makes service selection a challenging issue for cloud users. It is important to determine the best service that can fulfill user requirements. To this end, this paper proposes a hybrid multiple-attribute decision-making (MADM) model. The proposed method considers service measurement index cloud (SMICloud) structure for qualitative attributes of cloud services as well as user requirements based on fuzzy values to consider vague user requirements. Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy logic are used to rank cloud services. Furthermore, a fuzzy Delphi filtering method is proposed to decrease the execution time of ranking cloud services. In experiments, different aspects such as accuracy, execution time, scalability, and sensitivity analysis are investigated. The results confirm that the proposed method outperforms available methods in terms of execution time and scalability. Furthermore, the experiments show that the proposed method has achieved an accuracy of 96%.},

  title={Extracting User-Centric Knowledge on Two Different Spaces: Concepts and Records}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={8},
  number={},
  pages={134782-134799},
  abstract={The growing demand for eliciting useful knowledge from data calls for techniques that can discover insights (in the form of patterns) that users need. Methodologies for describing intrinsic and relevant properties of data through the extraction of useful patterns, however, work on fixed input data, and the data representation, therefore, constrains the discovered insights. In this regard, this paper aims at providing foundations to make the descriptive knowledge that is extracted by pattern mining more user-centric by relying on flexible data structures defined on two different perspectives: concepts and data records. In this sense, items in data can be grouped into abstract terms through subjective hierarchies of concepts, whereas data records can also be organized based on the users' subjective perspective. A series of easy-to-follow toy examples are considered for each of the two perspectives to demonstrate the usefulness and necessity of the proposed foundations in pattern mining. Finally, aiming at experimentally testing whether classical pattern mining algorithms can be adapted to such flexible data structures, the experimental analysis comprises different methodologies, including exhaustive search, random search, and evolutionary approaches. All these approaches are based on well-known and widely recognized techniques to demonstrate the usefulness of the provided foundations for future research works and more efficient and specifically designed algorithms. Obtained insights demonstrate the importance of working with subjectivity: an item is a type of soda but belongs to a pack, including two or more soda types.},

  abstract={Scoliosis is a complicated spinal deformity, and millions of people are suffering from this disease worldwide. Early detection and accurate scoliosis assessment are vital for effective clinical management and patient outcomes. The Cobb Angle (CA) measurement is the most precise method for calculating scoliotic curvature, which plays an essential role in diagnosing and treating scoliosis. This letter has conducted a systematic review to analyze scoliosis detection by vertebra identification and CA estimation using the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The major scientific databases such as Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), and IEEE Xplorer are explored, where 2017–2023 publications are considered. The article selection process is based on keywords like “Vertebra Identification,” “CA Estimation,” “Scoliosis Detection,” “Deep Learning (DL),” etc. After rigorous analysis, 413 articles are extracted, and 44 are identified for final consideration. Further, several investigations based on the previous work are discussed along with its Proposed Solutions (PS).},

  abstract={A high-stakes decision requires deep thought to understand the complex factors that stop a situation from becoming worse. Such decisions are carried out under high pressure, with a lack of information, and in limited time. This research applies Causal Artificial Intelligence to high-stakes decisions, aiming to encode causal assumptions based on human-like intelligence, and thereby produce interpretable and argumentative knowledge. We develop a Causal Bayesian Networks model based on causal science using  $d$ -separation and do-operations to discover the causal graph aligned with cognitive understanding. Causal odd ratios are used to measure the causal assumptions integrated with the real-world data to prove the proposed causal model compatibility. Causal effect relationships in the model are verified based on causal P-values and causal confident intervals and approved less than 1% by random chance. It shows that the causal model can encode cognitive understanding as precise, robust relationships. The concept of model design allows software agents to imitate human intelligence by inferring potential knowledge and be employed in high-stakes decision applications.},

  title={SAMStyler: Enhancing Visual Creativity With Neural Style Transfer and Segment Anything Model (SAM)}, 
  year={2023},

  pages={100256-100267},
  abstract={Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a popular technique of computer vision where the content of an image is blended with the style of another, which results in a fused image with certain properties of both original images. This approach has practical applications in various domains and has garnered significant attention in both industry and academia. An interesting application of this technique is segmented style transfer where a segmentation algorithm is used to locate objects within an image and then the style transfer method is performed locally, producing images with different styles for different objects. This approach opens up possibilities for creating visually striking compositions by seamlessly blending various artistic styles onto specific objects within an image, allowing for a new level of creative expression. This paper proposes a novel method that combines Segment Anything Model (SAM), a state-of-the-art vision transformer-based image segmentation model developed by Facebook, with style transfer. Our approach includes performing localized style transfer in selected segmentation regions of an image using classical style transfer algorithms. To ensure smooth transitions between the stylized and non-stylized border we also develop our loss function with a border smoothing technique. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed methodology, including the ability to infuse multiple artistic styles into different objects within an image. The contributions of this work include integrating SAM with style transfer, proposing a novel loss function, evaluating the segmented style transfer in multiple content regions, comparing with state-of-the-art approaches, and experimenting with multiple style images for diverse stylization. Our primary focus centers on creating a model that serves as a digital painter across a wide range of image genres and artistic styles.},

  abstract={The internet provides a very vast amount of sources of news and the user has to search for desirable news by spending a lot of time because the user always prefers their related interest, desirable and informative news. The clustering of the news article having a great impact on the preferences of the user. The unsupervised learning techniques such that K-means Clustering and Spectral Clustering are proposed to categorize the news articles by extracting discriminant features that help the user to search and get informative news without wasting time. The BBC news articles dataset is used to perform experiments that consist of 2225 news articles. The TF-IDF feature extraction technique is used with K-means clustering and Spectral clustering to get the most similar clusters to categorize the news articles in respective domains. Those domains are sports, tech, entertainment, politics, and business. The clustering algorithms are evaluated using adjusted rand index, V-measure, homogeneity score, completeness score, and Fowlkes mallows score. The experimental results illustrated that K-means clustering performs better than spectral clustering using the TF-IDF feature extraction approach. But to improve the results the canopy centroid selection is used with the grid search optimization technique to optimize the results of the Kmeans and named its as a K-Means using Grid Search based on Canopy (KMGC-Search). The experimental results shows the proposed approach can be used as a viable method for the categorization of news articles.},

  pages={138399-138413},
  abstract={Planarity of crisp graphs is a well-established field, whereas planarity within a fuzzy framework has seen recent development and extensive exploration. In an  $m$ -polar fuzzy graph ( $m$ PFG), each node and edge is associated with  $m$ -components, connected through minimal relationships. However, if one desires to incorporate maximum, average, or other intermediate relationships between nodes and edges, the  $m$ PFG concept becomes inadequate as in the  $m$ -polar fuzzy model, only minimum relation is considered. To address this limitation, a generalized model of  $m$ PFG is introduced in this article, allowing for a broader range of relationships to be considered simultaneously. This paper also discusses the properties of generalized  $m$ -polar fuzzy environments and generalized  $m$ -polar fuzzy graphs ( $\text{G}m$ PFGs), highlighting their isomorphism. Several significant findings and insights are presented in this paper. The article delves into the properties and characteristics of generalized  $m$ -polar fuzzy planar graphs ( $\text{G}m$ PFPGs) and explores various intriguing aspects related to them. Additionally, a novel concept of a generalized  $m$ -polar fuzzy dual graph ( $\text{G}m$ PFDG) is introduced, derived from  $\text{G}m$ PFPGs. The paper establishes a relationship between the dual of a  $\text{G}m$ PFG and  $\text{G}m$ PFG, examining their properties in the context of dual  $\text{G}m$ PFPGs. Lastly, the article discusses an illustrative example of a social group network problem assessing the group’s activity based on attributes such as cooperation, team spirit, awareness, controlling power, good behaviour, and creativity.},

  pages={94713-94731},
  abstract={The utilization of semantic web technologies has led to the development of knowledge graphs represented as triples that allow for the exploration of specific and cross-domains. Despite the advantages of semantic links between entities in facilitating user exploration, they can also lead to an overwhelming number of exploration choices that can cause confusion, frustration, uncertainty, and a sense of being lost in the abundant graph, particularly for users who are not familiar with the domain. Thus, identifying exploration strategies is critical to improving user exploration and increasing exploration utility. This study aims to identify exploration strategies that promote knowledge utility (i.e., increase users’ domain knowledge) and exploration experience (i.e., provide users with a positive and pleasant feeling). To accomplish this goal, an experimental user study was conducted, involving lay users in the musical instrument domain, where they were presented with an exploration task and then allowed to freely explore musical instruments. Parameters related to exploration paths were used to analyze the exploration patterns that users follow during their exploration. The findings reveal exploration strategies that promote knowledge utility and exploration experience. This research contributes to the literature on intelligent methods of guiding user exploration through knowledge graphs to enhance exploration effectiveness, which can have broad applications in knowledge graph utilization.},

  pages={14350-14363},
  abstract={Suicidal ideation detection is a vital research area that holds great potential for improving mental health support systems. However, the sensitivity surrounding suicide-related data poses challenges in accessing large-scale, annotated datasets necessary for training effective machine learning models. To address this limitation, we introduce an innovative strategy that leverages the capabilities of generative AI models, such as ChatGPT, Flan-T5, and Llama, to create synthetic data for suicidal ideation detection. Our data generation approach is grounded in social factors extracted from psychology literature and aims to ensure coverage of essential information related to suicidal ideation. In our study, we benchmarked against state-of-the-art NLP classification models, specifically, those centered around the BERT family structures. When trained on the real-world dataset, UMD, these conventional models tend to yield F1-scores ranging from 0.75 to 0.87. Our synthetic data-driven method, informed by social factors, offers consistent F1-scores of 0.82 for both models, suggesting that the richness of topics in synthetic data can bridge the performance gap across different model complexities. Most impressively, when we combined a mere 30% of the UMD dataset with our synthetic data, we witnessed a substantial increase in performance, achieving an F1-score of 0.88 on the UMD test set. Such results underscore the cost-effectiveness and potential of our approach in confronting major challenges in the field, such as data scarcity and the quest for diversity in data representation.},

Amidst the growing interest in leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for sensory analysis, our research distinguishes itself by employing a rigorous methodological framework. Our approach, named the ‘Incremental Analysis of Baseline Accuracy,’ identifies the chemical variables most predictive of wine quality. This framework aims to streamline the predictive process by pinpointing key variables that significantly influence quality assessments. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of a methodology that precisely determines the criticality of chemical inputs, both their exact values and their correct order, to identify which inputs significantly contribute to the quality assessment of a sensory perception, such as taste. The centerpiece of our paper is a vibrant 3D pie chart that illustrates the percentage criticality of different input variables for perceiving the quality of red wine. This chart symbolizes the essence of our paper: a ‘pie’ representing the empirical conclusion, not mere conjecture. Through this paper, we have shown that it is possible to quantify a qualitative, perceptual aspect like taste perception, which is often believed to be assessable only through subjective conjecture. Moreover, our findings, facilitated by the Incremental Analysis of the Baseline Accuracy method, demonstrate that this perception can be systematically quantified, challenging traditional assumptions about sensory analysis.},

  abstract={The study aims to improve the daily teaching level of the school and make students enjoy better teaching methods. Firstly, the Internet of Things (IoT) and deep learning (DL) are deeply studied through information technology (IT). Secondly, the calculation methods based on the IoT and DL are analyzed, through which the research model is constructed. Finally, a digital teaching platform is established through the research model to conduct a real-time statistical survey of students and teachers. The results show that students are leading in the daily teaching process. According to the survey results, most students spend 3 to 4 hours in daily extra-curricular learning; 45% of them acquire knowledge mainly through classroom learning, and 23% through online learning. Their main difficulty in learning is learning ability, accounting for 48%. Moreover, it is an energy problem, accounting for 28%. 64% of students are passive learning, far more than 37% of active learning students. This study combines multiple fields across disciplines, such as IT, IoT, and DL. Digital art teaching platforms usually focus on creativity and performance, and combining IoT and DL can provide art students with a more personalized, real-time teaching experience, and promote the cross-application of digital art and cutting-edge technologies.},

  abstract={This study aims to explore the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology and artificial intelligence (AI) in art education, assessing its impact on learners’ experiences and learning outcomes. The study first proposes a digital teaching system that enables the IoT and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to play a role in art education by monitoring students’ creative state in real-time, providing immediate feedback, and facilitating the generation of creative works. The system framework includes sensor nodes, an IoT platform, a GAN model, and a user interface to build a real-time interactive environment. Sensor nodes constantly collect physiological, movement, and environmental data from students, and the GAN model receives student data from the IoT platform, combining creative input from students to generate artwork in real-time. The generated works are transmitted to the discriminator through the IoT platform, which evaluates their quality and provides real-time feedback. Students interact with the system through the user interface, observe the generated artwork, adjust generator parameters, and propose new ideas. These interactions influence further artistic creation. The WikiArt public art creation dataset is selected to establish the experimental foundation, and the experimental evaluation focuses on image generation quality, system performance, and student learning outcomes. It is compared with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models. The research results indicate that the designed IoT and GANs integrated system remarkably outperforms DCGAN and VAE in image generation quality, with an Inception Score of 4.5, which is more diverse and recognizable than other models. Regarding system performance, the IoT and GANs integrated system is significantly ahead in image generation speed and user interaction, with a transmission speed of up to 200 Mbps. Regarding student learning outcomes, the system performs excellently in emotional feedback, learning outcomes, and creative work quality, achieving 80% satisfaction and 90% positive feedback. Overall, the research conclusion clearly points out that the integration of IoT and GANs has a significant and comprehensive effect on improving the quality of art education. This study expands the field of art education by integrating IoT and GANs, enhancing students’ creative experiences, and providing innovative methods for art teaching in the digital age.},

  abstract={The incidence of depressive disorder in Korea is the highest among OECD countries. The proportion of patients in their 20s is the highest. However, social gaze and false perception are causing problems such as not visiting the hospital or delaying the visit. Accordingly, we suggest a Korean model for predicting depressive disorders using data from online communities widely used by people in their 20s. In many countries, including South Korea, depressive disorders are diagnosed using DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) published by the American Psychiatric Association. We propose a model that predicts the probability of a user’s speech corresponding to nine criteria for diagnosing DSM-5 depressive disorder, following advice obtained through periodic meetings with a psychiatrist. The prediction performance was improved by using the correlation between each criterion in the model implementation stage.},

  abstract={In this paper, we propose an innovative tool able to enrich cultural and creative spots (gems, hereinafter) extracted from the European Commission Cultural Gems portal, by suggesting relevant keywords (tags) and YouTube videos (represented with proper thumbnails). On the one hand, the system queries the YouTube search portal, selects the videos most related to the given gem, and extracts a set of meaningful thumbnails for each video. On the other hand, each tag is selected by identifying semantically related popular search queries (i.e., trends). In particular, trends are retrieved by querying the Google Trends platform. A further novelty is that our system suggests contents in a dynamic way. Indeed, as for both YouTube and Google Trends platforms the results of a given query include the most popular videos/trends, such that a gem may constantly be updated with trendy content by periodically running the tool. The system has been tested on a set of gems and evaluated with the support of human annotators. The results highlighted the effectiveness of our proposal.},

  abstract={Smart spaces are physical environments equipped with sensors, actuators, and other computing devices to gather data and provide intelligent services to users. These spaces are made possible by ubiquitous computing, particularly context-aware computing. Although these systems are mainly implemented on mobile and other resource-constrained wearable devices, different techniques have been adopted for their implementation. Rule-based reasoning is a relatively easy-to-implement approach that can solve real-world problems. Rule-based systems rely on a set of assertions that constitute the working memory and a set of rules that govern what should be done with the set of assertions. Despite its relative simplicity, the working memory size is a critical factor in developing these systems, particularly for resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we propose techniques for efficiently calculating the working memory size. Our results show that all three techniques, DWM, APS, and SAPS, performed well in different ways. However, APS and SAPS consumed from 25% to 100% less memory than existing techniques.},

  abstract={This study is devoted to exploring the strategy of automatic sketch generation and optimization of industrial design based on deep learning. By combining the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with the optimization algorithm, this paper proposes an innovative method to realize the automatic generation of high-quality and diverse industrial design sketches. In the experiment, this paper selects SketchyCAD and other public data sets, trains them through deep learning model, and introduces genetic algorithm(GA) and differential evolution algorithm to optimize the parameters. In terms of experimental results, we observed that the quality of generated sketches was significantly improved, and the design sketches generated by the mode (GAN+GA) were more realistic and innovative. The introduction of optimization strategy further improves the generation effect and intelligently adjusts the model parameters to adapt to different design styles. In this paper, the influence of hyperparameter tuning is analyzed in detail, and it is found that the adjustment of learning rate plays a key role in generating quality and diversity. However, the experiment also revealed some challenges and room for improvement. We noticed that the generated results may have the risk of over-fitting in the training process, and with the increase of training times, the diversity gradually decreased. This suggests that more complex model structure and richer data sets are needed to improve the generalization performance. Generally speaking, this study provides new ideas and methods for the integration of deep learning and industrial design. By innovatively combining generation model and optimization algorithm, this research has contributed beneficial research results to the development of industrial design automation. This research is of great significance to promote the intelligence and innovation in the field of industrial design.},

  pages={130512-130523},
  abstract={A novel approach was proposed to develop a composition generation system for creating note sequences representing question-and-answer phrases (QAPs) in melodic phrases. Using a small dataset containing fewer than 10 compositions, the system is expected to generate new melodies that extend beyond the limitations of the original dataset. The modeling of note sequence data and selecting appropriate notes in specific sequences within the melody were chosen for gamelan skeletal melody generation using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) method. Gamelan, a traditional musical ensemble from Java, was selected as the focus of this research, with experiments centered on the gamelan skeletal melody, which plays a role similar to chord progressions in Western music. The evaluation was conducted by statistically analyzing the sequence of notations generated from the dataset and through expert testing. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate compositions with well-formed melodic phrases through a small dataset containing varying lengths, data mapping, feature selection based on QAP patterns, and GA. GA can enhance creativity in creating note sequences and new QAP patterns, including novel patterns.},

  pages={110322-110330},
  abstract={This study aims to explore the application of deep learning models in multi-track music generation to enhance the efficiency and quality of music production. Considering the limited capability of traditional methods in extracting and representing audio features, a multi-track music generation model based on the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) Transformer network is proposed. This model first utilizes the BERT model to encode and represent music data, capturing semantic and emotional information within the music data. Subsequently, the encoded music features are inputted into the Transformer network to learn the temporal relationships and structural patterns among music sequences, thereby generating new multi-track music compositions. The performance of this model is evaluated, revealing that compared to other algorithms, the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 95.98% in music generation prediction, with an improvement in precision by 4.77%. Particularly, the model demonstrates significant advantages in predicting pitch of music tracks. Hence, the multi-track music generation model proposed in this study exhibits excellent performance in accuracy and pitch prediction, offering valuable experimental reference for research and practice in the field of multi-track music generation.},
