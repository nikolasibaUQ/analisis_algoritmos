  abstract={The context of this work is that of designing an IMS-LD model for collaboration space of a Learning Management System (LMS). Our work is specifically in the field or seeking to promote, by means of information technology from a distance. Our approach is to first think about the conditions for creating a real LMS between learners, and designing the IT environment that supports this LMS. In this paper, we try to adapt the IMS-LD model with a collaboration model for Learning Management System based on the social constructivism. This adaptation will go through three stages. Firstly, the development of an LMS model. Secondly, the study of correspondence between the developed model and IMS-LD model and their transformation to IMS-LD model.},

  abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a accelerating brain disease that wreaks havoc on memory and cognition, as well as the ability to perform even the most basic tasks. Dementia, which gradually damages brain cells, is the primary cause of AD. People with this disease lose their ability to think, read, and do a variety of other things. A machine learning system can help to alleviate this problem by predicting the disease. The primary goal is to detect dementia in a wide range of patients. The classification of speech signal into various categories such as audio, non- audio is an very significant front-end problem in AD prediction. There are many features have been presented for AD prediction. Unfortunately, these characteristics are not mutually exclusive, and combining them has no effect on AD prediction performance. By removing these redundant and irrelevant features, Feature Selection (FS) provides a simple yet effective solution to this problem. Removing irrelevant data improves learning accuracy, decreases computation time, and allows for a more thorough understanding of the learning model or data. The proposed model in this paper is a hybrid machine learning model in which we used an FS approach based on Mutual Information (MI). MLP is used for classification and MFCC is used to extract all of the features from the ADReSSo dataset. In terms of accuracy, our experimental results show that the proposed classifier outperforms existing classifiers.},

  pages={208-218},
  abstract={Visual analytics (VA) tools support data exploration by helping analysts quickly and iteratively generate views of data which reveal interesting patterns. However, these tools seldom enable explicit checks of the resulting interpretations of data—e.g., whether patterns can be accounted for by a model that implies a particular structure in the relationships between variables. We present EVM, a data exploration tool that enables users to express and check provisional interpretations of data in the form of statistical models. EVM integrates support for visualization-based model checks by rendering distributions of model predictions alongside user-generated views of data. In a user study with data scientists practicing in the private and public sector, we evaluate how model checks influence analysts' thinking during data exploration. Our analysis characterizes how participants use model checks to scrutinize expectations about data generating process and surfaces further opportunities to scaffold model exploration in VA tools.},

  pages={1-10},
  abstract={Mobile devices are commonly found with learners in class, lecturers find it difficult to keep learners focused on the assigned learning activity as learners pretend to be attentive while multitasking. Some educators perceive the mobile devices as learning obstructers and think they should be abolished, however, research has revealed that if the devices are managed well, they can arouse the learner's curiosity to continue learning. The challenge is left to educators to figure out how to manage the learner's attention while using the mobile devices in class without compromising the quality of learning. With online learning tasks, observations and system login statistics as research instruments, this study investigated some of the factors that affected learners' attention and how they influence learner's engagement and learning outcomes in a mobile learning classroom. Using second year undergraduate learners as participants, each learner was allowed to connect and retrieve information from a content management system in order to access instructions and learning content. The learners interacted via chats, discussion forums and submit assignments online. Login data was captured and the lecturer observed learner behaviour. The results revealed that assignment feedback deadlines, instructions and content format, Learner Response time; and Learners' Self-Initiative, or drive played significant role in influencing learner's attention.},

  abstract={The AERPAW project is an ambitious project, funded by the PAWR program of the US NSF, to create a remote accessible research platform for a research facility with some distinct features that makes its usage model unique, and non-obvious to many researchers desirous of making use of this platform. AERPAW is primarily a physical resource (not a computing or cyber-resource) - the RF enviroment, and the airspace. Experimenters can explore them through radio transceivers and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, both under the Experimenter’s programmatic control. Since the entire workflow of the user is through the mediation of virtual computing environments, users often tend to think of AERPAW as a computing resource, and find some of the experiment workflow counter-intuitive. In this paper, we articulate the challenges and considerations of designing an experiment workflow that balances the need for guaranteeing safe testbed operation, and providing flexible programmatic access to this unique resource.},

  abstract={Cyber Bullying is one of the most recent evils of social media. With a boom in the usage of social media, the freedom of expression is being exploited. Statistics show that overall 36.5 percent people think they have been cyberbullied in their lifetime. These numbers are more than double of what they were in 2007, and there is an increase from 2018–19, suggesting we are heading in the wrong direction. Solutions to curtail this issue to a certain extent have already been deployed in the market. However, they possess limitations of usage, or simply do not use efficient algorithms. This paper aims at identifying cyberbullying at is origin, meaning when it is being drafted in real-time. Identifying traces of cyberbullying before the content is uploaded on the internet can help reduce circulation of hurtful messages. Using Machine Learning with the support of Natural Language Processing(NLP, results in better performance of cyberbullying detection.},

  abstract={The rise of cybercrime is a daily challenge for individuals, organizations, and governments, especially when resources are scarce and cyberattacks are becoming more complex. These organizations often find it difficult to identify and stop such attacks, but they must investigate them to reduce the damage. This study aims to create a detailed model to help with the investigations of cybercrimes. To build this model, we reviewed existing research on cybercrime and investigative methods, and we used analytical techniques, studies, and logical reasoning. After examining different stages of investigations and the information needed, we created a model and put it to the test by investigating an insider attack. We think that this model could be the foundation for practical guidelines to investigate security breaches in organizations with either limited or ample resources.},

Novel aspects of the concept include the potential for the selective use of the developer's engineering simulator during operational test and evaluation as well as the merits of a tightly coupled approach to the design of the engineering simulator and that of related training devices/simulators. Attention is given to the model which is emerging at the helicopter component of McDonnell Douglas and its relationship to some advanced thinking about a US Army preliminary master plan for simulation. The author draws some parallels between the approach as implemented by the 'prime' and the approach as it might be implemented between different Government laboratories in the context of the draft master plan. The author examines a particular aspect of this application, the simulation of the operational mission environment and where that responsibility might best lie. The issue of 'fidelity' is discussed with respect to current simulation technology limitations and their known effects upon performance.<>},

This paper describes and compares two approaches aimed at largely automating the process of building rapidly executing micro-level simulation models for complex traffic networks. Two traffic simulators have been designed and implemented, one based on GPSS/H, the other based on a model-specific simulation engine written in Pascal. The alternative-language approaches are discussed in general terms and their use is illustrated in a specific application.

  abstract={Unlike traditional animation techniques, which attempt to copy human movement, ‘cognitive’ animation solutions mimic the brain's approach to problem solving, i.e., a logical (intelligent) thinking structure. This procedural animation solution uses bio-inspired insights (modelling nature and the workings of the brain) to unveil a new generation of intelligent agents. As with any promising new approach, it raises hopes and questions; an extremely challenging task that offers a revolutionary solution, not just in animation but to a variety of fields, from intelligent robotics and physics to nanotechnology and electrical engineering. Questions, such as, how does the brain coordinate muscle signals? How does the brain know which body parts to move? With all these activities happening in our brain, we examine how our brain ‘sees’ our body and how it can affect our movements. Through this understanding of the human brain and the cognitive process, models can be created to mimic our abilities, such as, synthesizing actions that solve and react to unforeseen problems in a humanistic manner. We present an introduction to the concept of cognitive skills, as an aid in finding and designing a viable solution. This helps us address principal challenges, such as: How do characters perceive the outside world (input) and how does this input influence their motions? What is required to emulate adaptive learning skills as seen in higher life-forms (e.g., a child's cognitive learning process)? How can we control and ‘direct’ these autonomous procedural character motions? Finally, drawing from experimentation and literature, we suggest hypotheses for solving these questions and more. In summary, this article analyses the biological and cognitive workings of the human mind, specifically motor skills. Reviewing cognitive psychology research related to movement in an attempt to produce more attentive behavioural characteristics. We conclude with a discussion on the significance of cognitive methods for creating virtual character animations, limitations and future applications.},

  abstract={With the increasing popularity of Software as a Service (SaaS) clouds, software architects face new challenges in software architecture design, e.g. efficiently integrating those chosen web services into clouds. In this respect, early quality evaluation of the designed SaaS cloud application is crucial to mitigate the risk of later architectural changes due to a violation of quality requirements (such as response time, network throughput and scalability). Architects need to navigate in a rich set of offered services, a variability of the SaaS cloud environments, which makes it difficult to predict the general approach without time-consuming implementation of application prototypes (using GraphQL, Representational State Transfer (REST), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) approaches). In this paper, we present an abstract application model designed to select the details with a high level of scalability and efficient interactions between service components. This model is reusable and provides new way of thinking about cloud architecture.},

  abstract={Topic models, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), are successful in learning hidden topics and has been widely applied in text mining. There are many recently developed augmented topic modeling methods to utilize metadata information. However, the effect of topic models is still not comparable to humans. We think one key point is that humans have background knowledge, which is essential for topic understanding. Inspired by this, we propose a knowledge base enhanced topic model in this paper. We take knowledge bases as good presentations of human knowledge, with huge collections of entities and their relations. We assume that documents with related entities tend to have similar topic distributions. Based on this assumption, we compute document similarity information via the linked entities and then use it as a constraint for LDA. More specifically, we embed entities in a low-dimensional space via DeepWalk and use Entity Movers Distance to efficiently and effectively measure the similarities between documents. The results of experiments over two real-world datasets show that our method boosts the LDA model on the document classification while no supervision information is needed.},

  abstract={Small, medium, and big organizations get several advantages from cloud computing, but it also presents obstacles. Whether a firm is in the financial, technology, or engineering sector, a cloud component might be beneficial. Though there are numerous obstacles associated with cloud computing, experts think that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. The issues will be addressed when more research in the field of cloud computing is conducted. Cloud services are provided by a number of significant companies, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, among others. Among them, AWS (Amazon Web Services) is one of the fine cloud service providers that comprises several features, including the AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) which is one of the widely used by many organizations. Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud Web service delivers highly adjustable processing capacity throughout the cloud, allowing developers to construct applications with incredible scalability. Using EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) by using the proposed deployment method can be more effort saver for any IT development and deployment team for any organization. There should be an easy deployment method that auto-configures EC2 Instance. The aim of this research paper is to showcase the current deployment and service models provided by Amazon Web Services EC2 and present the proposed solution in order to the existing scenario. Furthermore, its advantages are also present so that it becomes easier to select the most appropriate one for deployment and research development.},

  pages={2591-2605},
  abstract={This paper presents an energy-based probabilistic model that handles nonnegative data in consideration of both linear and logarithmic scales. In audio applications, magnitude of time-frequency representation, including spectrogram, is regarded as one of the most important features. Such magnitude-based features have been extensively utilized in learning-based audio processing. Since a logarithmic scale is important in terms of auditory perception, the features are usually computed with a logarithmic function. That is, a logarithmic function is applied within the computation of features so that a learning machine does not have to explicitly model the logarithmic scale. We think in a different way and propose a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) that simultaneously models linear- and log-magnitude spectra. RBM is a stochastic neural network that can discover data representations without supervision. To manage both linear and logarithmic scales, we define an energy function based on both scales. This energy function results in a conditional distribution (of the observable data, given hidden units) that is written as the gamma distribution, and hence the proposed RBM is termed gamma-Bernoulli RBM. The proposed gamma-Bernoulli RBM was compared to the ordinary Gaussian-Bernoulli RBM by speech representation experiments. Both objective and subjective evaluations illustrated the advantage of the proposed model.},

  abstract={The analysis of personality behavior has become important in many applications such as educational hypermedia systems, psychotherapy, and business recommendation systems. With the development of social media platforms (SMPs), people can express their feelings and opinions through their personal posts, comments and/or tweets. This study aims to analyze texts on SMPs to identify users' personalities according to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) model. It also sought to enhance prediction accuracy and compare the findings with various deep learning techniques and previous literature. This study analyzes personality through a dataset that includes 8667 participants. Two deep learning techniques are implemented namely, long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN). Unlike earlier literature, this research helps improve the prediction accuracy of users' personalities by building a multi-layer deep learning network and integrating the random search optimization approach. The results suggest that LSTM with the application of random search optimization outperformed previous findings. The average prediction accuracy of the four dimensions namely, Introversion-Extroversion (IE), Feeling-Thinking (FT), Intuition-Sensing (NS), and Judging-Perceiving (JP) is 85.02%.},

This paper describes the theory and related work on the understandability of models and the performance of cognitive tasks such as requirements engineering. Our research into model representation is part of a larger effort on a theory of model relativity postulating that models affect how we think about the system of interest.

  abstract={With an aging population that continues to grow, dementia is a major global health concern. It is a syndrome in which there is a deterioration in memory, thinking, be-havior and the ability to perform activities of daily living. Depression and aggressive behavior are the most upsetting and challenging symptoms of dementia. Automatic recognition of these behaviors would not only be useful to alert family members and caregivers, but also helpful in planning and managing daily activities of people with dementia (PwD). In this work, we propose a vision-based approach that unifies transfer learning and deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for the effective recognition of behavioral symptoms. We also compare the performance of state-of-the-art CNN features with the hand-crafted HOG-feature, as well as their combination using a basic linear SVM. The proposed method is evaluated on a newly created dataset, which is based on the dementia storyline in ITVs Emmerdale episodes. The Alzheimer's Society has described it as a "realistic portrayal"1 of the condition to raise awareness of the issues surrounding dementia.},

In this paper we introduce the Little Big Data system, that has been developed with an ambitious task in mind: teach cloud computing basics to K-12 kids, helping them to be part of this revolution. We report on the creation of the system, the challenges, also the impact on higher K-18 education. The results, tested in the field with a wide variety of kids, children, have been extremely successful, thanks also to advanced educational techniques like gamification, have also provided valuable insights for the general problem of education of big data computing.},

  abstract={Accessibility is an important aspect of websites generally and public websites particularly. Many ways could be proposed to enhance accessibility, however the impact of selected actions is hard to predict due to diversification and contradiction, in addition to the existence of the time factor. A System Dynamics simulation model including factors affecting the accessibility of Norwegian municipal websites was encapsulated in an Interactive Learning Environment (ILE). As the model promised to be able to change how users think and take decisions, this ILE was tested by users in an experiment. We have conducted α, β, and γ change analysis on the results of this experiment. Results showed that the ILE was successful in changing 50% of its users' understanding and perceptions about the system's causal relationships and policy options, and helping 30% redefining the standards they use to assess or evaluate these relationships and policy options.},

  abstract={Emotion analysis is currently an attractive research topic in data mining and natural language processing. Along with the development of technology, people are also gradually evolving to post their emotional thinking on social media. Emotional information is useful for various aspects of business such as advertisement. Automatically classifying user emotions therefore becomes very important. In this paper we firstly formulate this problem under Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework. Actually language to express emotions is very diverse that make deep learning techniques such as CNN are ineffective in feature learning when the training data is not large enough. To solve this problem, we propose to use predefined grammatical patterns, which contain potential emotional information, to extract external features and integrate them into the CNN model. Our experiment are performed on two datasets, the ISEAR11http://affective-sciences.org/home/research/materials-and-onlineresearch/research-material/ (International Survey On Emotion Antecedents And Reactions) dataset and the Vietnamese emotion dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed model is very effective in comparison with previous studies.},

  abstract={Reservoir Computing is a paradigm of recurrent neural network (RNN) models, attractive because of its ease of training and new neuromorphic optoelectronic implementations. Applied with success to time series prediction and speech recognition, few works have so far studied the behavior of these networks on natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Therefore, we decided to explore the ability of Echo State Network-based Reservoir Computing (ESN) models with additional embedding layers to classify text documents of the Reuters C50 data set based on authorship. We explored various learned representations such as word and character embedding and deep feature extractors. Our experiments demonstrate that ESN models can achieve state-of-the-art results on this task and are competitive with common models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM). Moreover, we show that these models compute documents as data streams and could then be able to handle other tasks such as event detection and text segmentation. The best performance is obtained by an ESN with a large reservoir of 1,500 neurons based on word vectors. We think that these results demonstrate the possibility of processing massive quantities of textual data in the future using Reservoir Computing-based systems.},

  abstract={The high development of emerging computing paradigms, such as Ubiquitous Computing, Mobile Computing, and Social Computing, has brought us a big change from all walks of our work, life, learning and entertainment. Especially, with the high accessibility of social networking services along with the increasingly pervasive use of portable wireless mobile computing devices, more and more populations have been engaged into this kind of integration of real physical world and cyber digital space, which can be called the hyper world. To help people live better in the highly developed information society, the so-called cyber-individual (Cyber-I), which is far beyond a user model or a software agent to assist a user, has been proposed to provide the most comprehensive digital entities for its corresponding Real-I in terms of the individual's experience, behavior, and thinking as well as his or her birth, growth, and death. In this study, we concentrate on the personal data analytics to facilitate the cyber individual modeling. Organic Stream is introduced to systematically organize and refine the personal stream data, which can help improve the data processing and management in the CI-Spine tier and CI-Pivot tier of Cyber-I. The DSUN (Dynamically Socialized User Networking) model is employed to better utilize the collective intelligence from a group of users, which can help improve the CI-Mind tier to make Cyber-I to become more robust. Based on these, we discuss the functional modules for the facilitation of cyber individual modeling. Finally, a scenario is given, and the experimental results are presented to demonstrate that the valuable outcomes from the personal analysis can be utilized to enrich the Cyber-I, and provide users with more suitable services.},

  abstract={The migration of traditional deployment to clouds has driven the need for a more robust security model, the Zero-Trust model. The application of zero-trust principles addresses known security issues such as lateral movement attacks but adds extra identity management complexity. In addition, to cover a broader range of attacks, one must think of strategies to protect data, code, and credentials in such applications. Confidential computing aims to fulfill this goal. Nevertheless, confidential computing is even more complex to implement than Zero-Trust. In this work, we combine the Zero-Trust model with confidential computing by leveraging the SPIFFE standard through its reference implementation (SPIRE), and Intel SGX through the SCONE framework, to seamlessly supply software identities to confidential microservices. Furthermore, we also protected the whole identity-provisioning stack with Intel SGX and assessed the performance overhead. We believe this combination not only improves the security of SPIFFE deployments but also leverages SPIFFE to facilitate the integration between confidential computing components and native applications.},
