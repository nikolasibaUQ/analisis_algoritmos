  abstract={In recent years digital technologies and gadgets have grown so much. Along with other things, the field of Artificial Intelligence has also grown dramatically. Computer vision is one of the most compelling types of AI, which everyone must have experienced in one or the other way like in OCR, Image Recognition, object detection, google lens, etc. One might even come to the assumption that given any image or video to a computer, the computer can understand what’s going on in it and can comment a few things on it, just like WE HUMANS. But that assumption is not yet very true. It may be possible in the future but at the present these need some work to become reality. Leveraging this same motivation, we intend to give some contribution for our dream future to become reality. Recognizing and understanding any arbitrary chess board from the image, thereby digitizing it, is the thing that we will be achieving from the proposed system. Along with all that, giving a comment on the current state of chess board, thereby predicting the next optimal move in the game is another thing which is included in proposed system. Think of a human-like robot trying to play chess. Robots must have something like this in order to play the game. In the proposed research work digitization of Chess Board is done by server application from chess board image acquired by user. Current state of the board is generated and sent back as a response to client application. With the help of GUI, the chessboard is generated from the received Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) on the client side. Depending upon blacks turn or whites turn next optimal move to be played is shown to the user. With our proposed system digital instance is generated with accuracy of over 90%. All blank cells of the board are generated with almost 100% accuracy.},

  abstract={During the perceptual learning (PL) of a mobile robot, how to improve the efficiency of its behavior decision is a great challenge. The existing methods suffer from the less flexibility and low efficiency. This article proposes a novel methodology to address these problems. It mimics the principle that the human’s brain can still think, even when he/she neither receives any sensory stimulus nor performs any action, during the off-task process, a gated self-organization mechanism is used to trigger the “brain” of the mobile robot to work, analyze the scenarios that it encountered in the former tasks to decide the best moving direction, then store the sensed scenario information by means of the lateral excitation of the internal neurons in a developmental network (DN), and set up the weight connections from the internal area to high-level decision-making area of the DN. In the following PL, if the robot encounters a similar scenario, it can make a better and faster behavior decision. Therefore, this methodology can greatly enhance the efficiency of behavior decision with the limited training samples, without retraining in facing a new scenario. Most importantly, this methodology makes the robot continuously improve its intelligence through the autonomous learning, even in offline state. Extensive simulation and experiment results of the mobile robot PL demonstrate its potential. Since it is task nonspecific, the same learning principles are potentially suitable for other fields. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first trial to apply the transfer learning through the lateral excitation mechanism of internal neurons to the robot field with the emergent representation.},

  abstract={Interactive visualizations are powerful tools for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), but how do they affect the observations analysts make about their data? We conducted a qualitative experiment with 13 professional data scientists analyzing two datasets with Jupyter notebooks, collecting a rich dataset of interaction traces and think-aloud utterances. By qualitatively coding participant utterances, we introduce a formalism that describes EDA as a sequence of analysis states, where each state is comprised of either a representation an analyst constructs (e.g., the output of a data frame, an interactive visualization, etc.) or an observation the analyst makes (e.g., about missing data, the relationship between variables, etc.). By applying our formalism to our dataset, we identify that interactive visualizations, on average, lead to earlier and more complex insights about relationships between dataset attributes compared to static visualizations. Moreover, by calculating metrics such as revisit count and representational diversity, we uncover that some representations serve more as “planning aids” during EDA rather than tools strictly for hypothesis-answering. We show how these measures help identify other patterns of analysis behavior, such as the “80-20 rule”, where a small subset of representations drove the majority of observations. Based on these fndings, we offer design guidelines for interactive exploratory analysis tooling and refect on future directions for studying the role that visualizations play in EDA.},

  abstract={Humans cannot easily manage large stacks of unsorted items&#x2014; think of millions of different items randomly dumped and heaped in a warehouse.<superscript>1</superscript> The usual way for us to deal with a mess is to give it some order; for example, to find a name among one million we typically invest a lot of upfront work to sort all those names alphabetically; that investment pays back each time we look for a name, because then we know in advance where it is, and we don&#x0027;t have to read one million names to find the one we are looking for. The same in mathematics: to handle one million mathematical points we typically inscribe them in an equation, so we deal with just a few lines of algebraic script instead of having to deal with one million coordinates. In applied sciences, as in design, we do not handle dimensionless mathematical points, but physical particles, pixels, or voxels&#x2014;chunks of images and of three-dimensional objects; yet the logic is the same. No human can notate and calculate one billion parts (chunks, pixels, voxels) one by one. Life is too short for that. When dealing with data, simplification is the humans&#x0027; inescapable lot. That&#x0027;s the way our mind works.},

  abstract={Deep digitization drives value because it enables the exploitation of computational techniques to solve hard problems inherent to industrial enterprises. This includes product design, processes and procedures used in industrial settings tools and methods for manufacturing, and product maintenance, repair and overhaul. This paper will cover what is meant by deep digitization, review the thinking that has brought us to where we are today and look at the challenges and options that lay ahead. It will also describe what is meant by industrial transformation and identify the stakeholders and markets involved.The successful adoption of digitization is complex, multidisciplinary, requires systems thinking, and the mastery of a large number of technologies and disciplines. Success is also highly dependent on access to powerful tools, as well as management, organizational, and collaborative structures. Part of this paper will be focused on technology areas that stand out and pose challenges deserving special attention: computational analytics (CA), consisting of optimization methods, modeling, and simulation; artificial intelligence including machine learning; and lastly, data science and data engineering. Standards and common practices are also crucial and no more so than in the collection and dissemination of data within an enterprise and how that data is shared within a larger ecosystem. This paper will additionally describe past attempts at solving this problem and examine possible avenues for creating long-lived data protocols and building blocks for managing and extracting utility from the vast pools of data that can be found in industrial enterprises and the ecosystems they operate in.},

  abstract={Currently, part of the main tasks of digital control information technologies is to recreate a system that thinks logically and intelligently using a computer, and to create devices that make control decision-making like a human under positions of unpredictability and speculative. In this article, the processes of control decision-making in digital control information systems were systematically analyzed and studied. During the analysis of processes control decision-making in digital control information systems, its functions and shortcomings were determined using systematic approach methods. It was the initial stage of a detailed assessment of task positions and the results of statistical models of benchmark for control decision-making were considered. A control decisionmaking rule (master plan) has been developed that allows identifying and choosing the best solutions according to the benchmark and preferences of the control decision-maker. Based on this master plan, an array the most optimal solutions are formed, ranked among the available solutions for the current position. Also, efficiency measures and benchmark are formed, which are used to evaluate the results according to the selected efficiency benchmark and determine the priority level of option solutions corresponding to these results. A model for choosing the optimal solution according to effectiveness measures and benchmark has been developed. In this article, part of the main tasks of digital control information technologies is the creation and calculation of a computer-based information system that thinks logically and intelligently, as well as devices that make human-like control decision-making under positions of unpredictability and speculative. Computational experiments were conducted to solve fuzzy model tasks of control decisionmaking in digital control information systems. Based on the results of computational experiments on task solving, it can be seen that the quality, efficiency and reliability of control decision-making made in digital control information systems are improved.},

  abstract={Computer programming has become an increasingly cross-cutting theme and is no longer considered just a specialized subject. In some countries, the inclusion of this subject in the curricula of the basic cycles of their educational systems has been provided for, because it is recognized that programming promotes computational thinking which allows cognitive development of students. In Chile, the Universidad de La Frontera established that an initial programming course is given to all the Engineering degrees. Unfortunately, studies have shown that students are not achieving the competencies defined by the computational thinking approach. This research paper presents a flexible and systematic teaching framework for developing cognitive skills in programming courses. This framework considers the use of a systematic methodology of teaching programming, which focuses on the process of building solutions over the product; using electronic programmable devices; and sets of pre-defined exercises appropriate to various domains of the engineering area.},

  abstract={Many cities and countries are now striving to create intelligent transportation systems that utilize the current abundance of multisource and multiform data related to the functionality and the use of transportation infrastructure to better support human mobility, interests, and lifestyles. Such intelligent transportation systems aim to provide novel services that can enable transportation consumers and managers to be better informed and make safer and more efficient use of the infrastructure. However, the transportation domain is characterized by both complex data and complex problems, which calls for visual analytics approaches. The science of visual analytics is continuing to develop principles, methods, and tools to enable synergistic work between humans and computers through interactive visual interfaces. Such interfaces support the unique capabilities of humans (such as the flexible application of prior knowledge and experiences, creative thinking, and insight) and couple these abilities with machines' computational strengths, enabling the generation of new knowledge from large and complex data. In this paper, we describe recent developments in visual analytics that are related to the study of movement and transportation systems and discuss how visual analytics can enable and improve the intelligent transportation systems of the future. We provide a survey of literature from the visual analytics domain and organize the survey with respect to the different types of transportation data, movement and its relationship to infrastructure and behavior, and modeling and planning. We conclude with lessons learned and future directions, including social transportation, recommender systems, and policy implications.},

  abstract={As a novel framework in classroom teaching, digital games have gained traction. Anyone can play online games, that eventually ascribe potential for large-scale classroom instruction. Digital games have gained popularity in recent years as a way to encourage programming and computational thinking in pre-college (K-12) classrooms. Since the last decade, an ever-increasing number of learners have been drawn by the rapidly expanding areas of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Regardless of the fact that blending of AI/ML and online/digital gaming is a significant and critical subject for classroom pedagogy, there is indeed a paucity of comprehensive literature review in this domain. The aim of this paper is to take cognizance of recent studies and new findings on games that may be used to enhance AI/ML integrated pedagogy for effective curriculum transaction. Relevant articles and games were identified after a thorough exploration and were then included in this qualitative content analysis. This paper presents an overview of important published studies and games, as well as demonstrate how diverse games offer an exceptional and innovative prospect to educate a wealth of concepts and themes in AI and ML.},

  abstract={Educational Robotics (ER) has revealed several benefits in the educational context, not only helping the teaching of disciplines, but also making possible the development of several abilities, such as teamwork, problem-solving, and creativity. Among various robotics kits, LEGO® Robotics has been shown one of the best results considering some evaluated criteria (modularity level, hardware, curriculum, price, etc.). Some studies analyze the teaching practices, some compare technologies, and others evaluate the kits in a pedagogical way. However, it is essential to investigate all these contexts together in order to improve the impact produced by the ER in education and to know the best teaching practices associated with the most powerful technologies. The objective of this Research Full Paper is to identify: a) environments and programming languages adopted in the LEGO® Robotics context, b) educational practices applied during classes based on LEGO® Robotics, and c) the educational levels in which robotics has been applied with positive results. To achieve these goals, we planned and carried out a systematic review of the literature. Our main findings are: a) the most widely used environment and programming language are LabVIEW along with the LEGO®'s block-based programming language, b) we identified LEGO® Robotics is used for teaching programming, interdisciplinary contents, participation in tournaments, robotics, and computational thinking, c) LEGO® Robotics is used with success by students of different levels, such as K12, undergraduate, and graduated. Finally, we discuss some problems and limitations related to ER and point out that there is no standardization of teaching practices or methodologies for evaluating results, indicating that more research is needed to find the best scenario regarding technologies, methods, and target audience.},

  pages={1259-1270},
  abstract={Currently, there is a "boom" in introductory programming courses to help students develop their computational thinking skills. Providing timely, personalized feedback that makes students reflect about what and why they did correctly or incorrectly is critical in such courses. However, the limited number of instructors and the great volume of submissions instructors need to assess, especially in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), prove this task a challenge. One solution is to hire graders or create peer discussions among students, however, feedback may be too general, incomplete or even incorrect. Automatic techniques focus on: a) Functional testing, in which feedback usually does not sufficiently guide novices, b) Software verification to find code bugs, which may confuse novices since these tools usually skip true errors or produce false errors, and c) Comparing using reference solutions, in which a large amount of reference solutions or pre-existing correct submissions are usually required. This paper presents a semantic-aware technique to provide personalized feedback that aims to mimic an instructor looking for code snippets in student submissions. These snippets are modeled as subgraph patterns with natural language feedback attached to them. Submissions are transformed into extended program dependence graphs combining control and data flows. We leverage subgraph matching techniques to compute the adequate personalized feedback. Also, constraints correlating patterns allow performing fine-grained assessments. We have evaluated our method on several introductory programming assignments and a large number of submissions. Our technique delivered personalized feedback in milliseconds using a small set of patterns, which makes it appealing in real-world settings.},

  abstract={There is a strong movement asserting the importance of quality education all over the world and for students of all ages. Many educators believe that in order to achieve this 21st century skills must be taught and that digital literacy should be coupled with rigorous Computer Science principles and computational thinking. Accordingly this work will describe a didactic experience in an introductory programming course by describing the context, pedagogical approach, content of the course based on a procedure-first approach, technologies used, research questions addressed, experimental design adopted, data collection and analysis and the main conclusion supported by qualitative and quantitative data. The research questions focus on understanding which is the best medium to design algorithms by comparing flow chart and the Scratch programming language and by evaluating whether using textual language is worth the effort of the syntactic burden imposed by these languages. An analysis of quantitative and qualitative data revealed that both a visual programming and a flow-chart approach are suitable for algorithm design with no statistical difference in terms of number of errors and time taken to write the corresponding code in a textual language. However, the high number of errors suggest that using visual programming allows the student to focus on the problem solving activities.},

RoboSTEAM project is an Erasmus+ project defined to address these topics by using of physical devices and robotics employing Challenge Based Learning methodology. One of the first steps in the project development is the definition of current landscape in the research field. Which means to carry out a literature mapping that considers previous applications of Challenge Based Learning in STEAM education and use of robots and physical devices to do so. This paper shows the mapping review process and the main results obtained. The mapping analyze 242 candidate works from the most relevant bibliographic sources and selected 54. Form them it was possible to see that there are not many initiatives on STEM Education related to Challenge base learning and the most of them are specially focused on the application of specific tools and in the development of concrete competences.},

  abstract={Programming-based making activities are at the core of teaching strategies to engage young students in learning programming for developing computational thinking skills. Despite the initial evidences of enthusiastic participation in such activities, more systematic studies are needed to better understand drivers of students' intentions to participate in programming-based making activities. In this paper, we present an exploratory study which aim to address this issue by examining the interrelations among cognitive (i.e., perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use) and affective (i.e., enjoyment) characteristics for both boys and girls. To this end, we build on complexity theory and configuration theory, present a conceptual model, and employ fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) on a sample of 105 young students, to identify such interrelations. The findings provide insights on how the examined factors may have a different influence for boys and girls, an outcome that can be used to re-design educational programs targeting maximizing engagement regardless gender.},

  abstract={The development and innovative application of digital research methods in humanities disciplines, characterised as Digital Humanities or e-Humanities, is an established feature of the e-Science and e-Research landscape. Typically these digital methods enable existing research questions to be tackled in new ways, at a scale and speed that transcend manual methods. In this paper we present a different approach to the application of digital techniques to humanities research, a branch of experimental humanities in which digital experiments bring insight and engagement with historical scenarios and in turn influence our understanding and our thinking today. We illustrate this through a series of experiments and demonstrations inspired by the work of Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage, including simulation of the Analytical Engine, use of a web-based music application, construction of hardware, and reproduction of earlier mathematical results using contemporary computational methods.},

  abstract={Strong, equitable research practice partnerships (RPPs) center both researcher and practitioner perspectives and priorities. These RPPs facilitate rigorous, relevant research that practitioners can use to improve program implementation. Our project, The Maker Partnership, is an RPP focused on building knowledge about how to help elementary level teachers integrate computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) into their regular science classes using maker pedagogy. In this experience report, we use the Henrich et al. framework to assess the Maker Partnership's effectiveness along five dimensions and share practical advice and lessons learned. This paper contributes to the CS and RPP literature by providing insight into how an RPP can address critical problems of practice in computer science education.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={323-330},
  abstract={In this work, we aim to improve code writing skill in Python-based introductory programming courses for first-year university students. In such courses, students as novice programmers would benefit from personalised and formative feedback to: 1) quickly identify issues in their computational thinking process or coding techniques, and 2) know how to proceed when facing a certain problem. Due to the large number of students, it is impractical for instructors to manually assess all the work of each student to provide tailored feedback. We design and implement Automatic Programming Coach (AP-Coach), a web-based tool for automatically generating formative feedback for exercises on basic programming concepts. AP-Coach combines software engineering techniques (code similarity measures based on abstract syntax trees, and unit testing), and AI techniques (machine translation) in a novel manner to provide relevant feedback. We report promising results for AP-Coach in the following aspects: 1) quantitative evaluation of code similarity computation and machine translation, 2) qualitative evaluation of the perceived quality and usability of auto-generated feedback, and 3) experience of a selected group of computing students using the system.},

  abstract={Serious games have an already well-known positive impact on students’ motivation and their learning experience. In computer science education a majority of games and approaches exist, that provide engaging environments for students. On the one hand, these can be games related to learning algorithmic thinking but on the other hand, games to learn coding. Besides single-player games, there are also multiplayer games where players compete against each other or collaboratively work on programming tasks. However, many existing multiplayer games offer pre-defined levels where teachers have limited flexibility and individuality for their students. Additionally, many existing game environments use competitive over collaborative approaches. In our project, we extended an existing game by a multiplayer mode where players work together on coding tasks. The game elements support many coding-related concepts but also computational skills such as sequencing, conditionals, loops, and also advanced topics such as concurrency or dependencies using meaningful levels and tasks. However, we conducted an evaluation including 41 participants in three workshops: two in-class activities with secondary school students and an online activity with computer science students. Within these workshops, the students collaboratively worked on coding tasks within the game environment. Thereby, we observed the communication between the students while working on the tasks. Additionally, we evaluated the students’ attitudes towards collaborative learning. We found out that the in-game chat is barely used while in-class activities, especially when the tasks require only low coordination between players. We also found out, that students learn from each other and are more motivated when working together. With our approach, we want to provide educators with a flexible game environment where students can collaboratively improve their coding skills while solving engaging tasks.},

  abstract={Visual coding frameworks and block-based languages became an essential resource for computer science education. Applied in different courses and subjects they foster computational thinking, collaboration, and knowledge-sharing. Furthermore, sharing the outcomes promote the development of an open mindset and teaches the principles of open source. In our work, we present Pocket Code, a mobile open source visual coding framework. We describe how this integrated development environment enables young users to program apps in a block-based manner directly on their mobile devices. We discuss how teenagers can share their projects via the app's sharing platform or as an Android application package file. The presented case illustrates how teenagers can collaboratively drive co-creative communities and foster open source and innovation by creating and sharing mobile apps.},

  pages={1132-1136 vol.2},
  abstract={This paper presents a web-based distance education system that contains synchronous (live) video lectures, asynchronous learning materials with video-on-demand (VOD) archive data, and question and answer functions through digital reporting between a lecturer and students. It is intended to provide a collaborative workplace to encourage interactions among a lecturer/learners. As such, this environments enables learners to exchange their knowledge and their way of thinking, furthermore, to refine/build the knowledge acquired via lectures. One of the main purposes in our research is to build a flexible e-Learning environment by embedding self/collaborative support functions for the digitized live lectures in order to reinforce much more meaningful knowledge and skills. Moreover, we propose an innovative educational method of a cooperative link between a university and an industry for the higher education. The knowledge repository means a kind of data-warehouse with the computational mechanism to handle/manage various data occurred in e-Learning process. The knowledge repository may be utilized for any information referencing, diagnosing/evaluating of learners' activities, consulting and so on. We also tackle problems of knowledge sharing, knowledge-retrieval and various types of collaboration in the learning environment. The heart of our project is the exploration of how we can effectively make use of this knowledge repository to support learners who have a range of different needs, though we don't mention its technical details here.},

  abstract={Robotic technologies have opened up hundreds of new limitless perspectives for educational reform. We have conducted research to study the impact and outcomes of Robotic teaching in systematic studies, experimental studies, and surveys. The conclusions of this study reveal that educational robots have an impact on children, teachers, and students. We looked into how robots affect children’s behavior, learning outcomes, perceptions, and human interactions. The learning efficacy of educational Robot teachers is determined by a variety of factors, including learning outcome, student behavior and mood during class sessions, student reaction, and student involvement during workshops/class participation/quizzes/Q&A sessions. The majority of the research articles we chose were experimental studies, and they all met their objectives, which included teaching mathematical problems, unit conversion problems, teaching English/secondary language, developing analytical, and computational skills, behavior, and attitude development, critical thinking, and improving communication skills.},
