  abstract={Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention due to their impressive performance across various fields. Consequently, numerous researchers are exploring the potential of applying these models to graph problems. However, the effect of the temperature coefficient on graph reasoning within large models remains underexplored. To this end, we investigate the effect of temperature by using NLGraph as a benchmark. We aim to explore the effect of varying the temperature parameter in the discrete range of 0 to 1 on the models’ inference performance. The experimental results show that the LLMs’ sensitivity to temperature varies across tasks at different difficulty levels. In most cases, the accuracy is higher at moderate temperatures and lower at extreme temperature settings, suggesting that proper temperature tuning can improve inference performance. In addition, the effect of temperature change on accuracy is more significant in the shortest path problem. As the temperature increases, the tendency of the model to explore different solutions increases and the creativity and disorder of the response increases, leading to a decrease in accuracy and causing an increase in the rate of change.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Aging may increase the number of failures that underground power distribution cables undergo. Recent works have investigated this problem and proposed repairable failure models that consider the effects of aging as well as of loading conditions. This paper examines and assesses the performances of two models; one of them is called IEC-Arrhenius-Weibull, because it combines the failure rate function of the Weibull distribution with the Arrhenius relationship and the standard IEC 60287-1-1. First, we analyze the modeling assumptions, the methods for incorporating loading conditions, and the approaches for calculating the model parameters. And second, we evaluate the performance of the two models through computer simulations, sensitivity analysis, and cable rankings. The results strongly suggest that the use of the Arrhenius relationship to calculate the scale parameter of the IEC-Arrhenius-Weibull model leads to provide reduced failure rates that may affect cable maintenance, and that this model significantly depends on its shape parameter to describe different degrees of aging. Thus, this paper helps stakeholders to identify a realistic model for underground cable management.},

  abstract={The use of wireless control systems for human-computer interaction has grown in popularity recently. Earlier, people used to stick to input tools like a keyboard or mouse, which restrict one’s movement and interaction options, but now, newer technologies like computer vision, machine learning and AI have opened new and interactive ways of interacting with computers. This paper presents a hand gestures approach that not only can control presentations but is also useful for facilitating drawing and managing system volume which enrich the user experience and engagement by offering an interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse. With the help of this algorithm, the computer system accurately responds to hand movements in real time. With this model, one can easily navigate through slides, play, or pause videos, and perform multiple presentation related tasks using hand gestures. It boosts mobility and enhances audience engagement by removing the limitations posed by traditional input methods. It also allows users to digitally draw on the system. Users can sketch diagrams, annotate slides, and unleash their creativity without requiring drawing tablets. It uses Google’s mediapipe module to detect hand landmarks. We incorporated specific gestures that enable the model to initiate a particular action. It showed an accuracy of $\mathbf{9 8 \%}$ under normal lighting conditions, which slightly drops to $95 \%$ and $\mathbf{9 6 \%}$ in low and bright light, respectively, while the overall accuracy remains at $96.33 \%$.},

Most of the existing clothing design software is a subsystem of clothing CAD system, and its design method is mainly to use the mouse to replace the paintbrush or to use graphics processing software to process clothing photos, which lacks professional advantages and poor practicability. At present, in view of the disadvantages of most fashion design softwares, which focus on simple list of styles and interactive drawing functions, we put forward a digital fashion design system. The garment style can be automatically generated according to the user's requirements for garment style, material and color, and can be adjusted for style change, part increase or decrease, movement and part size modification. At present, the digitization of the garment field has participated in the whole process of garment industry production: anthropometry, garment fashion trend prediction, style design, model design, push version, code release, garment production, production management, process management, e-commerce, garment marketing, customer information management, etc.},

  abstract={Educational simulations can be useful for visualization of abstract and complex concepts and semiconductor physics seems ideal for this type of instructional support. The P-N diode is the most basic semiconductor device, but research has shown that its non-linear behavior poses problems to the students who struggle to explain its micro-scale behavior. Research in educational technologies for semiconductor materials and devices has shown improved learning with computer simulations. Freely available educational simulations that include the P-N junction show how the depletion width, the internal electric field, and band diagram changes with applied voltage. However, these diagrams are not directly used to visualize the different current components at the micro-scale. This work-in-progress paper discusses the initial design of an educational simulation of a P-N junction diode showing how the different current components vary dynamically with the applied voltage. The proposed simulation fills a void in the instructional materials related to the P-N diode by allowing students to visualize the impact that the applied voltage has on device current and determine its non-linear behavior.},

  abstract={Creating background music based on vocal sounds using deep learning is challenging. The task involves multiple input and multiple output cases that require lengthy input and output as data. However, training the models with raw data using low-end computers is expensive since training takes a long time and requires high memory. Previous studies predominantly have used Recurrent Neural Networks or Transformer models trained with the pitch, timing, and amplitude of scripted musical notes to generate new background music sequences. In this research, we proposed a novel training procedure using simple Gated Recurrent Units as the basic architecture of the model, which is trained with compacted high-dimensional vectors based on raw long audio sequences. Our experiments showed promising results, even when executed on low-end hardware. Our best model achieved a cumulative moving average of the loss of around 0.016, and the model successfully produced interesting background music based on vocal sound.},

  abstract={The commonly used programming approach in teaching computer graphics requires students to learn a lot before they can generate basic and not-so-realistic images. As a result, students may easily be lost in the jungle of programming primitives, and their high expectation fades away quickly. Moreover, the API based programming approach does not support global illumination models. To address these problems, a new approach that combines ray tracing and programming has been used in a junior level elective course, Introduction to Computing with Geometry, with great success. With ray tracing, we are able to cover the camera metaphor, basic shapes, geometric modeling, coefficients of an illumination model, light sources, textures, surface tessellation, smooth and nonsmooth triangles, and algebraic surfaces. A student can learn all the basics and generate beautiful and realistic looking images easily and quickly. This paper details our approach and presents our course materials, exercises, student work and evaluation.},

  abstract={The development of alternative business models through computer simulation enables the company to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the enterprise as well as the dangers and threats arising from the environment, analyze different options and select the most appropriate model for the enterprise situation. The aim of the present study is to reveal the extent to which Bulgarian companies know the contemporary tools of process management and what techniques they use to model their business processes. The research conducted between September 2017 and March 2018 demonstrates the main thesis of the authors, namely that Bulgarian business is becoming more and more innovative and more adaptable to environmental changes by applying a wide range of business process management tools. A large part of Bulgarian enterprises are becoming more and more mature in their processes, using the broad portfolio of BPM tools, such as Lean and Six Sigma to enhance quality, for automating processes such as workflow and for transformation and radically redesign such as reengineering of the business processes.},
