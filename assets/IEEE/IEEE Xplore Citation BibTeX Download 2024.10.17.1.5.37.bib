  abstract={The human's ability for taking risk, which is one of the most important human attributes, has strong effect on his decision making. The bidding problem is an important issue for supplier agent participating in the power market. Thus, in order to get realistic insight about the supplier behavior, it is necessary to model the supplier's risk strategy and evaluate its effect on the bidding problem. Considering the human's thinking fuzzy nature, the supplier agent's risk characteristic is modeled using the fuzzy logic. Combining the fuzzy logic with the Q-learning algorithm, the intelligent supplier agent' bidding strategy is determined based on his risk strategy. A simulator is designed based on the proposed method. The supplier agents' realistic behaviors with different characteristics are studied numerically using the designed simulator},

  abstract={Quality of Web service, especially the reputation, has become a benchmark to differentiate the services and providers. Unfortunately, the current reputation research in the field of Web services don't reasonably and correctly think about the randomicity and fuzziness which has been the basic issue in the relative research area about trust. We proposed two novel metrics to qualify the reputation of Web services and providers. We designed two kinds of trust model based on cloud model theory to describe the randomicity and fuzziness of the two metrics. Furthermore, a formalized calculation was provided to obtain the trust degree of services requestors to Web services and providers.},

  title={Compressed Sensing with uncertainty - the Bayesian estimation perspective}, 
  year={2015},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={421-424},
  abstract={The Compressed Sensing (CS) framework outperforms the sampling rate limits given by Shannon's theory. This gap is possible since it is assumed that the signal of interest admits a linear decomposition of few vectors in a given sparsifying Basis (Fourier, Wavelet, ...). Unfortunately in realistic operating systems, uncertain knowledge of the CS model is inevitable and must be evaluated. Typically, this uncertainty drastically degrades the estimation performance of sparse-based estimators in the low noise variance regime. In this work, the Off-Grid (OG) and Basis Mismatch (BM) problems are compared in a Bayesian estimation perspective. At first glance, we are tempted to think that these two acronyms stand for the same problem. However, by comparing their Bayesian Cramèr-Rao Bounds (BCRB) for the estimation of a L-sparse amplitude vector based on N measurements, it is shown that the BM problem has a lower BCRB than the OG one in a general context. To go further into the analysis we provide for i.i.d. Gaussian amplitudes and in the low noise variance regime an interesting closed-form expression of a normalized 2-norm criterion of the difference of the two BCRB matrices. Based on the analysis of this closed-form expression, we obtain two conclusions. Firstly, the two uncertainty problems cannot be confused for a non-zero mismatch error variance and with finite N and L. Secondly, the two problems turn to be similar for any mismatch error variance in the large system regime, i.e., for N, L → ∞ with constant aspect ratio N/L → ρ.},

  abstract={China began to research the tertiary oil recovery process from the 1980s. This technology is very mature in the current, but the economic benefits for the EOR project evaluation studies are relatively less and simple, moreover, the evaluation method is single, almost all enterprises have chosen to use net present value method. But net present value method ignores the flexibility which is managed by the decision-makers under uncertainty, not suitable for oil field development investment project evaluation. Real option valuation and strategic decision-making are an important way of thinking, often used in the evaluation of oil exploration, but for oil and gas production, dynamic process of evaluation studies are rarely involved. As the EOR project has the option characteristics, this article will introduce the idea of real options to the EOR project and try to establish the differential equation model of the EOR project evaluation. Differential equations are used for tertiary oil recovery project to analyze the option value.},

  abstract={With the present home security system, a timer is incorporated in a terminal installed in the home. The purpose is to allow the user time to change the alarm mode of the terminal from disarmed to armed and close the door when leaving the residence; conversely, the user needs time to open the door and change the alarm mode from armed to disarmed when returning to the residence. However, we think the timer is stressful for the user and represents a problem that, should an intruder gain entry, the situation cannot be reported immediately. Therefore, we propose a system to solve these problems. Since the proposed system is capable of recognizing the principal user through the use of an RFID tag, the terminal can appropriately change the alarm modes and quickly provide notification of an intruder. We will also confirm that the proposed system functions effectively through experiments, describe the effectiveness of the proposed system, and consider feasibility studies.},

They totally or partially ignore the fact that not all data objects are equally important with respect to the clustering purpose, and that data objects which are close and dense should have more influence to sub-cluster centroid. we think that the similarity or dissimilarity of two objects is not depend on all attributes with special need, some attributes should be use to measure the dissimilarity, others attributes should impact the centroid in other way. A new weighted clustering algorithm call GBWCA is proposed to deal with different objects weight. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we use some real and artificial dataset to compare with other algorithm, we present performance comparisons of GBWCA versus k-means and show that GBWCA is consistently superior.},

  abstract={Partheno-Genetic Algorithm (PGA) repeals crossover operators of Traditional Genetic Algorithm (TGA) while uses the reproduction manner with only parent. Comparing with TGA, the genetic operation of PGA is simpler; the initial population of PGA need not be varied; there is no "immature convergence" during using PGA; the searching efficiency of PGA is higher. As PGA uses the reproduction manner with only parent while no using the reproduction manner with double parents as such most of the biology, most of the scholar thinks that PGA does not belong to the category of genetic algorithms. In this paper, based on concept of abstract system, two abstract systems, PGA and TGA are constructed and it is proved that the two abstract systems are isomorphic, so PGA has the same computing mechanism as TGA, that is to say, PGA belongs to the category of genetic algorithms as TGA.},

  abstract={The power system measurement data has high-dimensional features and strong noise, which is difficult to be directly used for intrusion detection. Traditional feature extraction and selection methods take the feature processing as a preprocessing step and perform separately from the model training, which makes the features not well adapted to the model. Therefore, we propose a novel wrapped feature selection framework based on the Las Vegas algorithm, which can improve the detection accuracy by strengthening the coupling between the feature selection and the model training. The Las Vegas algorithm can evaluate a feature subset through a specified model. In this paper, a heuristic thinking is integrated into the Las Vegas algorithm, which greatly improves the search performance of the original method. Finally, the proposed framework is examined on the IEEE 14-bus, 39-bus and 57-bus test systems for two attacks and the experimental results proves the effectiveness and stability of the proposed framework.},

  abstract={Twitter is a microblogging and social networking service platform; users can post what they feel and think about to share with others. Although it facilitates users' social behaviour, a high degree of freedom of speech also leads to cyberbullying. The statement released by UNICEF showed that 36.5% of middle and high school students experienced cyberbullying, and 87% observed cyberbullying. Cyberbullying has greatly affected people's daily lives. We conduct this study to detect whether online comments contain cyberbullying behaviours and classify cyberbullying to alleviate this problem. This paper uses an improved information gain algorithm for feature selection, and the bidirectional LSTM neural network is used for classification. On the premise that the information gain threshold is limited to 0.0004, the precision on the test set can reach 95.15%.},

  abstract={Sleep plays a parallel role in maintaining good health as diet and exercise. It not only improves the performance of our brain but also manages our mood swings and maintains our health. Not getting proper hours of sleep on a regular basis may become the reason for many disorders and diseases. Stress often impacts the sleep cycle of an individual resulting in a severe impact on their physical and mental health. Stress even affects the cognitive functioning of an individual, which refers to the mental processes involving memory management, decision thinking, etc. So, eventually, stress becomes a common factor for both. This study proposes an approach helping individuals to reduce stress by turning towards a proper sleep cycle eventually resulting in an increase in cognitive functioning. This paper uses the conventional method of machine learning through which it could be justified that as stress increases the number of hours slept by the person decreases. Furthermore, a correlation was established between sleep stress and cognitive functioning through which it could be concluded that sleep affects cognitive functioning. Previous research studies suggest that there is a link between video games and increased cognitive functioning, So, this study proposed the solution as a game named CANDY CRUSH which is much popular among middle age groups as it is easy to learn and can prove to be stress releaser for them eventually leading to better cognitive functioning.},

  abstract={Interaction is a process in which two or more people exchange thoughts and feelings with each other, transmit information and influence both sides. Class interaction refers to the interaction between teachers, students and students in the special environment of classroom. IoT is a network that connects any goods with the Internet through various information sensing devices according to the agreed protocol, and carries out information exchange and communication, so as to realize intelligent identification, positioning, tracking, monitoring and management. Applying the conceptual model and thinking mode of the Internet of Things (IoT) to English Language Teaching (ELT) can also get good results, which leads to the change of ELT mode. This paper analyzes the shortcomings of the current IoT technology application process, and expounds the application of IoT optimization engine based on RETE algorithm in university ELT process. The simulation results show that the accuracy of IoT optimization engine based on RETE algorithm is higher than that of traditional algorithm. With the increase of the number of experiments, the accuracy of RETE algorithm is stable at about 95%, and the real-time wavelength tends to be stable. Therefore, applying the IoT optimization engine based on RETE algorithm to English interactive teaching can make IoT technology play a more active role in ELT in universities and achieve better implementation effect.},

  abstract={Since the seminal works of R.F. Engle (1982) and T. Bollerslev (1986) about heteroskedastic return series models, many extensions of their (G)ARCH models have been proposed in the literature. In particular, the functional dependence of conditional variances and the shape of the conditional distribution of returns have been varied in several ways (A.K. Bera and M.L. Higgins, 1993; T. Bollerslev et al., 1992). These two issues have been addressed by the neural network community using multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and mixture density networks (MDNs). We extend the concept of MDNs in a recurrent way to allow for "GARCH effects". These recurrent MDNs (RMDNs) offer a consistent framework to analyze the impact of nonlinearity and of non Gaussian (leptokurtic) conditional distributions on the explanatory power of volatility models. We present numerical experiments on a very large return data set, the size of which allows one to perform detailed statistical tests to compare the obtained results. In summary, conditional non Gaussian distributions (fat tails in the conditional distributions) tend to be more important than nonlinear specifications for conditional means and variances in the likelihood framework. With respect to other error measures however, the application of nonlinear neural networks seems to be promising. We think that the choice of a particular model for predicting volatility is closely related to the question of how to measure the prediction performance of a model.},

  abstract={Ontology helps us to think about the real world with its semantic constraints. But there exist different uncertainties and ambiguities that cannot be considered using traditional ontologies. This paper mainly deals with classification using fuzzy ontology and Neutrosophic ontology. Classification based on Neutrosophic ontology incorporates Neutrosophic logic for its working and is compared with classification based on fuzzy ontology on appendicitis dataset from Knowledge extraction based on evolutionary learning.},

  abstract={Slow learner is a person who has low level intelligence of thinking skills compared to other people at average age rate. In Malaysia, slow learners have been recognized as students who need special education. The Ministry of Education has created classes for special needs in several schools in order to help them in learning. In class, slow learner students have difficulty in memorizing and understanding a topic especially in mathematics. Using a new technology as educational tools will help them in better understanding of a concept. Implementing educational game applications in learning will help them more focus and enjoy. However, educational games that focus on mathematics for slow learners are rarely found. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to develop an educational game for primary school slow learners that focus on mathematics. This project implements the ADDIE model for the development of the project. There are five phases including this model which are Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation. The testing and evaluation had been conducted at school at Temerloh, Pahang involved slow learner’s students and a teacher. The result indicated that the students and teacher give positive feedback and they agree that this application helps the slow learner to get better understanding in mathematics subjects.},
