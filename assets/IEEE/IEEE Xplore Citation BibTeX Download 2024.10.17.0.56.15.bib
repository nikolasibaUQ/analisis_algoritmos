  abstract={Humanoid robots, with a focus on personalised social behaviours, are increasingly being deployed in educational settings to support learning. However, crafting pedagogical HRI designs and robot interventions that have a real, positive impact on participants' learning, as well as effectively measuring such impact, is still an open challenge. As a first effort in tackling the issue, in this paper we propose a novel robot-mediated, collaborative problem solving activity for school children, called JUSThink, aiming at improving their computational thinking skills. JUSThink will serve as a baseline and reference for investigating how the robot's behaviour can influence the engagement of the children with the activity, as well as their collaboration and mutual understanding while working on it. To this end, this first iteration aims at investigating (i) participants' engagement with the activity (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory-IMI), their mutual understanding (IMIlike) and perception of the robot (Godspeed Questionnaire); (ii) participants' performance during the activity, using several performance and learning metrics. We carried out an extensive user-study in two international schools in Switzerland, in which around 100 children participated in pairs in one-hour long interactions with the activity. Surprisingly, we observe that while a teams' performance significantly affects how team members evaluate their competence, mutual understanding and task engagement, it does not affect their perception of the robot and its helpfulness, a fact which highlights the need for baseline studies and multi-dimensional evaluation metrics when assessing the impact of robots in educational activities.},

  abstract={This paper describes a new technological evolution of the Sucre project, which aims to foster a vocation for science and develop computational thinking and programming skills in pre-university students. This improved version is called Sucre4Stem and has been designed from the Internet of Things perspective. At a technological level, we differentiate two main tools, SucreCore andSucreCode. SucreCore provides a new, more compact design, encapsulates an advanced microcontroller and supports wireless connectivity with the ability to create online variables and functions. SucreCode, the block-based visual programming tool, has a revamped interface and allows wireless communication with SucreCore. At the pedagogical level, Sucre4Stem makes it easier to implement new group dynamics and to create novel types of collaborative projects between groups of students. In this article, we also explore how these collaborative projects can be carried out by taking advantage of the different types of communications between SucreCore and the server-side platform using shared online variables and functions.},

  pages={1287-1295},
  abstract={Scratch enables children to learn about programming by creating games and animations, and is currently one of the most popular introductory programming languages. While Scratch has been found to increase students' motivation and interest in programming, it has been debated whether Scratch users practice and learn about core programming concepts such as loops, conditional expressions, procedures and variables. This paper presents a large scale study of the progression of the programming concepts practiced by Scratch users through an analysis of their complete public project portfolios. A dataset of over 112 thousand authors and their 1 million projects was constructed and analyzed from three viewpoints. First, we investigate the development of programming concepts by looking at block usage statistics for each project in the users' repositories. Second, we score and analyze the dataset using a computational thinking rubric. Third, we identify users that have left the Scratch platform and evaluate the learning goals they have achieved. Our results show that, while users progress in Scratch, there is a positive trend in the use of all concepts that were examined. Within the least utilized concepts, even after the 20th project of Scratch users, are procedures, conditional loops and logic operations. Examining the users who have left the Scratch platform after creating at least the mean amount of nine projects, we measured that half had left without ever utilizing procedures, and a third had left without ever utilizing conditional loops.},

  abstract={This Research to Practice Full Paper presents our experience in teaching an introductory programming course in Python by using a visual programming development environment based on flow-charts and active learning with an interactive eBook. The field of computer science education is always being challenged with the high attrition rates despite the ever growing industry demand for computing expertise. The lower rate of student retention is often associated with considerable dropout and failure rates in introductory programming courses during the freshmen year. The main challenge is getting students to write meaningful programs in a short time by focusing more on computational thinking principles and less on language details at that point in time. Nowadays, most students prefer to be engaged and discover course content through exploration, interaction, and collaboration that is relevant, useful, and fun compared to traditional blackboard-based lecturing styles. For evaluation of learning outcomes based on the quantifiable criteria with robust statistical analysis, eleven sections of the course over three semesters were considered. The initial evaluation of summative assessment and analysis of a survey result enable us to conclude that the proposed instructional approach increases student engagement, facilitate learning and contribute to the progress of students in this course.},

  abstract={This article presents a course that relates environmental education and the development of STEAM skills through the valorization of WEEE (Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment). As a didactic tool, the BEAM Robots are used, which are simple robots that can be built with elements extracted from WEEE. For the execution of the course, a four-phase curriculum design is developed: propaedeutics, assembly, Computational Thinking (CT), and WEEE. The course is built in a modular way and implemented virtually. The students were evaluated with pre and post-surveys, to investigate the impact of the course. In addition, evaluation activities were created that made it possible to follow the development of the students. In general, it can be concluded that the course had a positive impact on students' STEAM skills and knowledge, as well as an improvement in environmental awareness related to the creative reuse of WEEE.},

  abstract={There has been a limited number of studies in which a computing curriculum is designed and developed for students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), but no study has tested the effectiveness of an accessible computing curriculum for students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Therefore, the objectives of this study are to evaluate the effectiveness of such a computing curriculum in improving the learning of computational thinking concepts (CTCs: flow control, data representation, abstraction, user-interactivity, synchronization, parallelism, and logic) by comparing computing projects developed by two groups of students (Potential Development Middle School (PDMS) and Rich Center for Autism (RCA)) of twenty-one students with ASD and by investigating the progressive improvement of a total of 312 computing projects developed by students (138 in PDMS and 174 in RCA) over 20 sessions. Students in both groups were equal in their knowledge of CTCs at the pretest, and RCA and PDMS groups were taught utilizing the accessible and original CT curriculums, respectively, in this experimental study. The results showed that the original CT curriculum was statistically significantly more effective in learning of logic. Additionally, when all seven CTCs as a single construct were examined, the original CT curriculum was statistically significantly more effective than the accessible one. Furthermore, an investigation of the gradual increase in students' computing project scores throughout 20 sessions showed that both curriculums were statistically significantly effective in progressively improving students' learning of data representation, abstraction, synchronization, parallelism, and all CTCs as a single construct. When the correlations between CTCs and sessions for individual groups (PDMS & RCA) were analyzed, both curriculums were statistically significantly effective in increasing scores of synchronization and all CTCs as a single construct. The accessible and the original CT curriculums were also statistically significantly effective in improving students' learning of data representation and abstraction, respectively.},

  pages={1:1-1:11},
  abstract={Creative problems are ill-defined, and thus experimentation, evaluation, and iteration are key elements of creative problem solving. We present a computational theory of evaluation in creative design. Our technique evaluates a design concept by analogically comparing it with alternative articulations of the concept. We operationalize this theory of analogical comparison in the context of biologically inspired design that uses biological analogies for conceptual design of technological systems. Our technique of analogical comparison supports evaluation of prior technological designs, biological source cases, as well as candidate conceptual designs through analogical mapping between alternative functional models of these design concepts. Given a functional model of a design concept and an alternative functional model of the same design concept, analogical comparison leverages a novel hierarchically organized analogical mapping technique to align the two models and identify the differences between them. Our technique is implemented in an operational artificial intelligence agent called Design Evaluation through Simulation and Comparison (DESC). We evaluate DESC through computational experimentation across several models to illustrate its strengths and limits and to highlight areas for future research.},

  pages={517-528},
  abstract={As one of the most popular visual programming languages, Scratch has a lot of evaluation around it. Reasonable evaluation can help programmers understand their projects better. At the same time, it can also provide a reference for them to browse other projects in the online community. Most of the existing evaluations on Scratch are carried from three perspectives: Computational Thinking (CT) ability, visual presentation aesthetics, and code quality. Among them, the assessment of CT and code quality is mainly carried out from the program script, while the evaluation of visual aesthetics is analyzed from the perspective of image sequences generated by project execution. The single-view evaluation focuses on the performance of a program in a certain aspect and is one-sided. In this paper, we propose a multi-view evaluation framework to integrate various evaluations using different policies. We quantitatively analyze the assessment of different views driven by data. Combined with overall evaluations that represent human opinions, we analyze their differences and connections. Through experiments, we determine the weights of different integration policies, the proposed multi-view evaluation method can generate evaluation results similar to human opinions.},

This significance is particularly pronounced in a global landscape transitioning into the 4.0 era, characterized by pervasive information technology integration into daily life. This research endeavors to explore the potential of utilizing board games for coding education, specifically targeting student demographics lacking access to modern technology and educational resources, such as ethnic groups or remote populations distanced from urban centers. The board game’s efficacy in augmenting programming comprehension was evaluated through testing and feedback solicited from students and teachers in schools across Chiang Rai Province. Moreover, insights from computer science educators were incorporated to refine gameplay and enrich knowledge components, ensuring adaptability and applicability for future educational contexts.},

  abstract={In most of e-commerce site, evaluation systems are employed to evaluate each user after the tradings. Normally, seller's evaluation score is shown in e-commerce site that is computed based on score given by buyers. In recent e-commerce site, the evaluation is based on multiple attributes and buyers give their thinking for each attribute. In this viewpoint, the seller evaluation in e-commerce is collected knowledge from buyers and synthetic score is computational intelligence because each buyer makes his/her decision whether he/she trades with the seller. In this paper, we discuss the computational intelligence of evaluation system in e-commerce. Then, to avoid asymmetric and incomplete information in tradings, we design a mechanism of trader evaluation. After that, we give some experiments to show the rate of successful trade in our proposed mechanism. Contributions of this paper are showing theoretical discussion of e-commerce computational intelligence, design on evaluation mechanism and showing the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.},

  abstract={The increasing interest in understanding the behavior of biological neural networks, and the expanding utilization of artificial neural networks in different fields and scales, both require a thorough understanding of how technological computing works. However, von Neumann in his classic "First Draft" warned that it would be unsound to use his suggested paradigm to model neural operation, furthermore that using "too fast" processors vitiates his paradigm, which was intended only to describe (the timing relations of) vacuum tubes. Thus, it is worth scrutinizing how the present technology solutions can be used to mimic biology. Some electronic components bear a surprising resemblance to some biological structures. However, combining them using different principles can result in systems with inferior efficacy. The paper discusses how the conventional computing principles, components, and thinking about computing limit mimicking biological systems.},

  abstract={EarSketch lowers the barriers to entry and broadens engagement in computer science through expressive and culturally relevant music composition. In EarSketch, students write computer code to remix sound samples into original music compositions, often within hours of first exposure to the application. Coupled with sound samples rooted in modern music genres, EarSketch generates deep student engagement. We observed two unexpected challenges when implementing EarSketch in high school Computer Science Principles courses. First, music that appeals to the students' generation may be difficult for teachers to appreciate (and vice versa). Second, while a majority of students engaged in music production and coding, we observed that some students fixated on artistic musical expression without engaging in substantial computational thinking. These findings may apply more broadly in computational courses situated in expressive domains and to STEAM courses in general. We conclude with suggested changes to professional development, which may be applied more generally to creative computation and STEAM-based courses.},

  abstract={In patient monitoring fuzzy-based evaluation can be used advantageously, because of its characteristics. This approach can work with input factors, for which sharp limits cannot be defined and it can handle uncertainties, subjectivity in the data as well as the evaluation process. The conventional Mamdani inference is the most suitable method, because it helps to build a model, which is much closer to human thinking, but its computational needs are very high, due to the complex-shape functions. This paper introduces a flexible patient monitoring system optimization, where the input functions can be tuned according to the personal statistics. Modified versions of the Mamdani inference are applied in this system, which can reduce computational complexity, while they retain the advantages of the original method.},

  title={Incrementalization of Vertex-Centric Programs},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1019-1029},
  abstract={As the graphs in our world become ever larger, the need for programmable, easy to use, and highly scalable graph processing has become ever greater. One such popular graph processing model-the vertex-centric computational model-does precisely this by distributing computations across the vertices of the graph being computed over. Due to this distribution of the program to the vertices of the graph, the programmer “thinks like a vertex” when writing their graph computation, with limited to no sense of shared memory and where almost all communication between each on-vertex computation must be sent over the network. Because of this inherent communication overhead in the computational model, reducing the number of messages sent while performing a given computation is a central aspect of any efforts to optimize vertex-centric programs. While previous work has focused on reducing communication overhead by directly changing communication patterns-by altering the way the graph is partitioned and distributed, or by altering the graph topology itself-in this paper we present a different optimization strategy based on a family of complementary compile-time program transformations in order to minimize communication overhead by changing both the messaging and computational structures of programs. Particularly, we present and formalize a method by which a compiler can automatically incrementalize a vertex-centric program through a series of compile-time program transformations-by modifying the on-vertex computation and messaging between vertices so that messages between vertices represent patches to be applied to the other vertex's local state. We empirically evaluate these transformations on a set of common vertex-centric algorithms and graphs and achieve an average reduction of 2.7X in total computational time, and 2.9X in the number of messages sent across all programs in the benchmark suite. Furthermore, since these are compile-time program transformations alone, other prior optimization strategies for vertex-centric programs can work with the resulting vertex-centric program just as they would a non-incrementalized program.},

  year={2021},
  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={168850-168868},
  abstract={Educational digital storytelling is widely recognised as a powerful approach in developing literary skills, experiencing problem-solving and computational thinking, information and knowledge visualisation, building creativity and divergent thinking supported by technological solutions. However, educators feel that they miss opportunities, skills, and tools to support pupils developing creativity. Hence, we proposed a digital learning environment, named Novelette, to support both educators and learners in performing visual storytelling by scaffolding them in inventing and authoring stories. The main novelty of our approach lies in embedding literary artifices widely explored in learning settings into a digital learning environment, such as the opportunity to continue someone else’s story and the suggestion mechanism to explore analogies or synonyms starting from a word of interest. Novelette has been ideated not only as a learning environment for educators, but with educators, as it results from a user-centered and participatory design methodology to involve them in the entire design and development process actively. This paper focuses on the assessment of Novelette usability according to both educators and pupils. As a conclusive step of the co-design approach, developers tested the resulting usability according to educators in a controlled environment. Moreover, it reports usability according to learners in real settings at school. Results demonstrate that Novelette is considered usable by both target groups, and it is perceived as a powerful approach in developing creativity both according to quantitative insight offered by the System Usability Scale, a.k.a., SUS, and qualitative interpretations enabled with direct observations and structured after scenario questionnaires. We can conclude that Novelette is a pleasant and usable tool to invent and author stories and seems to be a promising approach to develop creativity.},

  year={2010},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={257-264},
  abstract={This paper analyzes the applicability of the task programming model in the parallelization of generic wave front problems. Computations on this type of problems are characterized by a data dependency pattern across a data space, which can produce a variable number of independent tasks through the traversal of such space. Precisely, we think that it is better to formulate the parallelization of this wave front-based programs in terms of logical tasks, instead of threads for several reasons: more efficient matching of computations to available resources, faster start-up and creation task times, improved load balancing and higher level thinking. To implement the parallel wave front we have used two state-of-the art task libraries: TBB and OpenMP 3.0. In this work, we highlight the differences between both implementations, from a programmer standpoint and from the performance point of view. For it, we conduct several experiments to identify the factors that can limit the performance on each case. Besides, we present in the paper a wave front template based on tasks, template that makes easier the coding of parallel wave front codes. We have validated this template with three real dynamic programming algorithms, finding that the TBB-coded template always outperforms the OpenMP based-one.},

  abstract={The primary goal of cognitive computing is to design a digitalized model that is able to mimic human thinking processes. The cognitive engine is in charge of implementing the functionality of a cognitive system. Nowadays, cognitive engines are used as a self-organized management mechanism in different fields such as computer networks, Internet of Things (IoT), and Robotics. This is because the management algorithms of these fields are going to be very complex and therefore human thinking models as digitalized models are required for fast and accurate decision making. In this paper, we summarize challenges in designing cognitive engines. Then, a set of challenges in designing the cognitive engine for body-mind operating system in the digitalized healthcare system is obtained. In the literature, our survey and also suggested case study in the healthcare system have not been considered yet.},

  abstract={John Clark was inventor of the Eureka machine to generate hexameter Latin verse. He labored for 13 years from 1832 to implement the device that could compose at random over 26 million different lines of well-formed verse. This article proposes that Clark should be regarded as an early cognitive scientist. Clark described his machine as an illustration of a theory of “kaleidoscopic evolution” whereby the Latin verse is “conceived in the mind of the machine” then mechanically produced and displayed. We describe the background to automated generation of verse, the design and mechanics of Eureka, its reception in London in 1845 and its place in the history of language generation by machine. The article interprets Clark's theory of kaleidoscopic evolution in terms of modern cognitive science. It suggests that Clark has not been given the recognition he deserves as a pioneer of computational creativity.},

  title={COPOD: Copula-Based Outlier Detection}, 
  year={2020},

  pages={1118-1123},
  abstract={Outlier detection refers to the identification of rare items that are deviant from the general data distribution. Existing approaches suffer from high computational complexity, low predictive capability, and limited interpretability. As a remedy, we present a novel outlier detection algorithm called COPOD, which is inspired by copulas for modeling multivariate data distribution. COPOD first constructs an empirical copula, and then uses it to predict tail probabilities of each given data point to determine its level of "extremeness". Intuitively, we think of this as calculating an anomalous p-value. This makes COPOD both parameter-free, highly interpretable, and computationally efficient. In this work, we make three key contributions, 1) propose a novel, parameter-free outlier detection algorithm with both great performance and interpretability, 2) perform extensive experiments on 30 benchmark datasets to show that COPOD outperforms in most cases and is also one of the fastest algorithms, and 3) release an easy-to-use Python implementation for reproducibility.},

  abstract={This concept of evolvable, process-oriented modular systems may be viewed as a new business model to sustain European competitiveness in micro and mini assembly. It is clear that this business model implies a high dynamic lifecycle for shop floors. The system will move from a static life cycle since the modules that create the different systems will live beyond the product lifecycle. This dynamicity imposes strong requirements on the way systems are designed, installed, operated, and reengineered. Re-configurability is not enough. These requirements will not only have an impact on the individual control architecture of the modules but also on, and this is very important, how the system is created, and several types of co-existing architectures},

  abstract={Construction of audit internal control intelligent system based on Blockchain and cloud storage is conducted in this paper. At present, the development of artificial intelligence in various fields is getting better and better, and the artificial intelligence information technology is slowly beginning to converge towards the auditing field. The blockchain storage application system requires each node to store a complete data, causing waste of the storage resources; at the same time, it does not make full use of the network routing traffic resources. Based on this background, this paper proposes the novel AI and BC based intelligent system for the audit internal control. The system is designed and validated through the simulation. The proposed intelligent system can improve the overall efficiency.},

  abstract={The K-12 ICT (Information and Communication Technology) curriculum in Taiwan faced many changes in last two decades. In 1990s, Computers is a required subject in junior high schools and an elective subject in senior high schools, along with many elementary schools offered computer classes. In 2000s, when ICT was popular in schools and families, Taiwan MOE (Ministry of Education) decided that ICT should be integrated into all subjects and Computers was excluded from the required learning areas in K-9 education. On the other hand, computing science was considered important in senior high schools and Introduction to ICT became a compulsory subject in 2006. As Taiwan will implement a twelve-year public education program, the MOE is undergoing revising the existed K-12 curriculum. This paper reports our recommendation on a new ICT curriculum to be implemented in K-12 schools. The recommended ICT curriculum is based on Delphi research methodology. The merit of Delphi technique is to form consensus among experts through several rounds of questionnaire survey. By reviewing the ICT curriculum from many developed countries and organizations, we drafted a preliminary ICT curriculum, including its strands, objectives, and framework. The study is still undergoing. The paper reports the preliminary results of the first stage of our Delphi survey.},
