  abstract={Many educational institutions have modified their curricula to include computational thinking and coding courses for all students. However, it is not always easy to engage non-CS students in coding. Hackathons are often suggested as tools for exposing people to fun real challenges, promoting alternative ways of learning and increasing their interest in coding, and CS in general. Thus we ask, could a hackathon be used specifically within a CS1 class to motivate students and boost their performance (measured in grades)? In this article, we analyze data from 1253 students before and after an educational hackathon, observing changes in motivation towards the class and ultimately the students’ grades. We discovered that although there are variations in motivation and performance on those attending the Pyweekend, either as participants or attendants (general public), it is difficult to conclude that those variations are solely caused by the hackathon. We also include suggestions as how to extend this study to further understand the effects of hackathons on the motivation and grades of CS1 students.},

  abstract={Difficulties in teaching and learning introductory programming have been studied over the years. The students’ difficulties lead to failure, lack of motivation, and abandonment of courses. The problem is more significant in computer courses, where learning programming is essential. Programming is difficult and requires a lot of work from teachers and students. Programming is a process of transforming a mental plan into a computer program. The main goal of teaching programming is for students to develop their skills to create computer programs that solve real problems. There are several factors that can be at the origin of the problem, such as the abstract concepts that programming implies; the skills needed to solve problems; the mental skills needed to decompose problems; many of the students never had the opportunity to practice computational thinking or programming; students must know the syntax, semantics, and structure of a new unnatural language in a short period of time. In this work, we present a set of strategies, included in an application, with the objective of helping teachers and students. Early identification of potential problems and prompt response is critical to preventing student failure and reducing dropout rates. This work also describes a predictive machine learning (neural network) model of student failure based on the student profile, which is built over the course of programming lessons by continuously monitoring and evaluating student activities.},

  abstract={Computational and data-intensive science increasingly depends on a large Web Service infrastructure, as services that provide a broad array of functionality can be composed into workflows to address complex research questions. In this context, the goal of service registries is to offer accurate search and discovery functions to scientists. Their effectiveness, however, depends not only on the model chosen to annotate the services, but also on the level of abstraction chosen for the annotations. The work presented in this paper stems from the observation that current annotation models force users to think in terms of service interfaces, rather than of high-level functionality, thus reducing their effectiveness. To alleviate this problem,we introduce Functional Units (FU) as the elementary units of information used to describe a service. Using popular examples of services for the Life Sciences, we define FUs as configurations and compositions of underlying service operations, and show how functional-style service annotations can be easily realised using the OWL semantic Web language. Finally, we suggest techniques for automating the service annotations process, by analysing collections of workflows that use those services.},

  abstract={What other people think" has always been makes us curious while indulge in decision making process. Earlier, many of us asked our personal acquaintances to recommend a political candidate or political party to whom we can vote or consult a broker to decide in which share we should invest our money. With the invent of Internet and world wide web have now let it happen to find out large pool of online users to share recommendation, opinion, views about an event. Although these online users are never our personal acquaintance nor professional critics. An irony of situation is many people are sharing opinions available to completely unknown person via Internet. In the beginning of 21st century, social networking websites taken exponential growth in popularity among online users by providing them a platform for discussion and exchange information. Apart from posting photos and videos for event, now online users are posting their comments, views, opinion about event. With this platform, most researchers are analyzing posts or opinion, performing computational methods to come to conclusion about popularity of event. This analysis part is becoming more powerful day by day to gauge user’s opinion and would play a significant role for someone to make major decision in future. The social microblogging sites such as Pinterest, Tumblr, Apsense, Scoop and specially Twitter are leading pools of online users and contains massive information that can be useful by extracting knowledge from information and that knowledge become asset for business specialist, political specialist, marketing specialist etc.},

We prove the feasibility of the idea by: (i) collecting a large dataset of board game information; (ii) designing and testing an information processing pipeline for automatically discovering game categories and game mechanics, with some first encouraging results. In the future, we plan to further generalize this approach for different kinds of games and for discovering currently unknown but useful aspects, e.g. games or game features that could better foster Computational Thinking in education, those better suited to be applied in social distancing contexts, and so on.},

  pages={641-646},
  abstract={Whilst there has been growing interest in the use of social robots in educational settings, the majority of this research focuses on learning outcomes, with less emphasis on the social processes surrounding these interactions. One such understudied factor is children’s trust in the robot as a teacher. Trust is a relevant domain in that if and how children trust a robot could influence their subsequent learning outcomes. The extent to which the robot’s behaviour (including making errors) influences trust is yet to be fully explored. Consequently, the goal of this research is to determine the role of trust in children’s learning from social robots. We report a pilot study investigating the conceptualisation and measurement of chil-dren’s trust in robots. 33 children aged between 4-9 completed a computational thinking learning task with a NAO robot at a Science Festival. Observations of the interactions in terms of developing tasks and measurements for child robot interaction are discussed. The findings tentatively suggest children’s trust in the robot can be divided into two parts: social affiliation towards the robot, and perceived competence/reliability of the robot.},

  abstract={This paper is about a particular technical problem in the study of autonomy in constructed complex systems: how can a computing system decide that it needs a new symbol system to re-express all of its own processes? We have shown earlier that a constructed complex system will need to change its symbol system, by proving two theorems that limit what it can do with a fixed symbol system. To change that phenomenon, we need construction mechanisms that can themselves be changed and elaborated. In this paper, we show how a constructed complex system can decide that it needs to change its symbol system, and how it can do it. We think that if we can change the construction mechanisms, then we have another way to escape the trap of creeping rigidity: we can elaborate the units out from underneath the existing structures. This brings us directly to computational semiotics, which is the study of the treatment and use of symbols in computing systems. This paper is primarily intended to stimulate discussion and further research in these areas.},

  abstract={Mobility-on-demand systems are transforming the way we think about the transportation of people and goods. Most research effort has been placed on scalability issues for systems with a large number of agents and simple pickup/drop-off demands. In this paper, we consider fair multi-vehicle route planning with streams of complex, temporal logic transportation demands. We consider an approximately envy-free fair allocation of demands to limited-capacity vehicles based on agents' accumulated utility over a finite time horizon, representing for example monetary reward or utilization level. We propose a scalable approach based on the construction of assignment graphs that relate agents to routes and demands, and pose the problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). Routes for assignments are computed using automata-based methods for each vehicle and demands sets of size at most the capacity of the vehicle while taking into account their pickup wait time and delay tolerances. In addition, we integrate utility-based weights in the assignment graph and ILP to ensure approximative fair allocation. We demonstrate the computational and operational performance of our methods in ride-sharing case studies over a large environment in mid-Manhattan and Linear Temporal Logic demands with stochastic arrival times. We show that our method significantly decreases the utility deviation between agents and the vacancy rate.},

Such tools allows the user to program while manipulating blocks that represent programming languages instructions. iVProg is among this class of tools and was firstly implemented in Java and could be integrated to Moodle using iAssign. Due to technological evolution, iVProg also evolved to iVProgH and its integration to Moodle is still possible by using the new version of iAssign that allow the integration of HTML stack packages to Moodle. In this paper we describe how this evolution takes place and presents iVProgH functionalities as well as iAssign extension to include HTML packages into Moodle. In addition, we give some teaching support whenever integrated using iVProgH with Moodle using iAssign.},

  abstract={Machine-learning algorithms are playing an increasingly important role in embedded sensing applications, by enabling the analysis of signals derived from physically complex processes. Given the severe resource constraints faced in such applications (energy, functional capacity, reliability, etc.), there is the need to think about how the algorithms can be implemented with very high efficiency. This paper examines the opportunities on three levels: (1) inherent resilience against computational errors, enabling some degree of fault tolerance; (2) top-down training of statistical models using data explicitly affected by errors, enabling substantial fault tolerance; and (3) bottom-up specification of inference kernels based on preferred hardware implementation, enabling reduced hardware complexity. Implementations employing the last two approaches are proposed and evaluated through hardware measurements and simulation.},

  abstract={Protein-Protein docking is a recent practice in biological research which involves using 3D models of proteins to predict the structure of complexes formed by these proteins. Studying protein-protein interactions and how proteins form molecular complexes allows researchers to better understand their function in the cell. Currently, the most common methods used for docking are fully computational approaches, followed by the use of molecular visualization tools to evaluate results. However, these approaches are time consuming and provide a large number of potential solutions. Our basic hypothesis is that a virtual reality (VR) framework for molecular docking can combine the benefits of multimodal rendering, of the biologist's expertise in the field of docking, and of automated docking algorithms. We think this approach will increase efficiency in reaching the solution of a docking problem. However designing immersive and multimodal virtual environments (VE) based on VR technology calls for clear and early identification of user needs. To this end, we have analyzed the task of protein-protein docking as it is carried out today, in order to identify benefits and shortcomings of existing tools, and support the design of new interactive paradigms. Using these results, we have defined a new approach and designed a multimodal application for molecular docking in a virtual reality context.},

These are students from several disciplines including computer sciences, mathematics, geographical information systems, engineering technology, and educational technology. The laboratory is centered around a computer-controlled model railroad system and a range of simple to sophisticated robotic platforms. The laboratory equipment and layout encourage "near-peer" teaching activities such as presentations and group projects. The student projects move beyond basic theory verification by requiring students to practice higher-level thinking, and students are able to physically observe the results of their own computational solutions to problems. The student projects encourage students to reorganize knowledge, understand computation in the context of larger systems, and discover the connections among several disciplines.},

In spite of this, in the Chilean higher education system, as in most parts of the world, teaching programming is a challenging endeavor, partly because the majority of freshmen students in STEM undergraduate programs have not been introduced to the fundamentals of the discipline and its applications in K12 education. Therefore, students' attitudes, engagement, and autonomous learning can make a difference in how students in STEM disciplines in higher education face their first programming course. In the present study, we carried out measurement of variables associated to these constructs involving a sample of 1694 freshmen of seventeen STEM programs in a Chilean research university. Relevant differences were found among different STEM programs, and by student gender. Implications of the results obtained and future research avenues are discussed.},

  abstract={Scratch is a popular programming platform with plenty of learning resources. However, it is quite difficult for users to find suitable resources. In this paper, in order to provide the resources which the users require, we propose a Scratch Recommendation Framework Adaptive to User Interest Drifts (SRFA-UID). First, a user interest drifts model is designed, which adopts the time decay factor and the weights of operation behaviors to track users' dynamic interest. Then, on the basis of users' current and historical interest, we calculate their combined user similarity. Next, we present a novel two-hop-algorithm to update users' friend community. Considering the preferences of the whole friend community, the Computational Thinking (CT) skills of users and the impact factors of items, we put forward a recommendation function to obtain items that are related to users. For an item, the function can calculate its F value to determine if we can recommend it to the users. Experimental results show that SRFA-UID performs better than other state-of-the-art methods in the Scratch dataset.},

  abstract={The so called associative thinking, which humans are known to perform on every day basis, is attributed to the fact that human brain memorizes information using the dynamical system made of interconnected neurons. Retrieval of information in such a system is accomplished in associative sense; starting from an arbitrary state, which might be an encoded representation of a visual image, the brain activity converges to another state, which is stable and which is what the brain remembers. In this paper we explore the possibility of using an associative memory for the purpose of enhancing the interactive capability of perceptual vision systems. By following the biological memory principles, we show how vision systems can be designed to recognize faces, facial gestures and orientations, using low-end video-cameras and little computational power. In doing that we use the public domain associative memory code.},

The paper focuses on the programming and Maths aspects, being fundamental to IoT development, in addition to computational thinking and coding concepts for the HE students. The research objective is to build a framework for developing IoT skills within higher education to establish the computing competencies needed for this rapidly expanding technology. The investigation included the most widely used programming language for IoT, Python, and the Maths skills at the HE level, which are essential for developing successful infrastructure, functionality, security algorithms and encryption tools for IoT. Quantitative research methodology is applied on empirical data obtained on non-Computer Science students (Non-CS) in a HE institution in UAE. There is a correlation between in university (InUni) Maths skills and Python programming course's performance. Compared to Engineering students, Business students may found it more challenging to learn Python programming language, which also applies to their Maths skills. This suggests better IoT competencies developed by Engineering students. The paper concluded that N on-CS students are able to obtain sufficient knowledge of, and skills in, using Python within one semester. The future study should consider other factors, such as general knowledge, business awareness, technology applications and legal issues.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present our findings of investigating non-linear multi-target tracking techniques when jointly used with object classification. The transferable belief model (TBM) is utilized in the multi-target evaluation, data association, and target classification stages. A particle filter is used to track each of the targets and uses a motion model that is relevant to the classification given to that target. The targets are classified based upon their motion throughout the scene and their land based position. We show how this system can deal with prior knowledge and lack of knowledge. Situations, with data of this type, regularly occur in real world scenarios and we think it is very important that any system must be able to cope well to such situations. Bayesian and regular DST methods have shortcomings when dealing with such scenarios. We show that the TBM approach can be generally more computational tractable and more robust.},

These courses have an excellent curriculum that contains a mix of computational thinking concepts such as a focus on creativity, abstraction, coding, as well as increasing awareness about the cyber footprint of the students with respect to security and privacy. While the curriculum is excellent, we need to be more mindful about incorporating pedagogical strategies that promote inclusive teaching especially for women and minorities who are traditionally underrepresented in computer science.To address the challenges associated with teaching a truly inclusive course, we developed a new course titled “Inclusive Strategies for Computer Science Education” that draws attention to the strategies that have been studied over the years in STEM and CS education literature. We present the contents of the course along with a post-hoc qualitative survey on the applicability and practicality of the material discussed in the course.},

  abstract={Plagiarism is known as an unauthorized use of other's contents in writing and ideas in thinking without proper acknowledgment. There are several tools implemented for text-based plagiarism detection using various methods and techniques. However, these tools become inefficient while handling a large number of datasets due to the process of plagiarism detection which comprises of a lot of computational tasks and large memory requirement. Therefore, when we deal with a large number of datasets, there should be a way to accelerate the process by applying acceleration techniques to optimize the plagiarism detection. In response to this, we have developed a parallel algorithm using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) and tested it on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) platform. An equivalent algorithm is run on CPU platform as well. From the comparison of the results, CPU shows better performance when the number and the size of the documents are small. Meantime, GPU is an effective and efficient platform when handling a large number of documents and high in data size due to the increase in the amount of parallelism. It was found out that for our dataset, the performance of the algorithm on the GPU platform is approximately 6x faster than CPU. Thus, introducing GPU based optimization algorithm to the plagiarism detection gives a real solution while handling a large number of data for inter-document plagiarism detection.},

  abstract={Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) capacitate a myriad of possibilities and creativity. Therefore, while teaching evolutionary programming to students of Computer Science, we decided to equip them with the technical details and then let them explore the creative aspects themselves. As part of the introductory course on Artificial Intelligence, an evolutionary generation of art is an assignment The teaching goals were to inform students of creative aspects of EA as well as invoke critical thinking and analysis in them. The students generated images via EA, and the only restriction was on the pixel size for input. The assignment was well-received, despite its complexity. Students engaged with the art generation and felt confident in expressing their perspectives of creativity and art The assignment evaluation as a contest allowed for judges from diverse domains such as Computer scientists and artists. The goals of the course are met as the students were trained not only in technical details but also realized the capacity and generative power of algorithms, as they practically simulated and expressed their creative thoughts via this contest Furthermore, the students engaged with the philosophical foundations of computational creativity effectively by the design process, and a report completed along with the work required them to develop their own artistic exegesis of the algorithm.},

  abstract={Buffer overflow is one of the most dangerous and common vulnerabilities in CPS software. Despite static and dynamic analysis, manual analysis is still heavily used which is useful but costly. Human computation harness humans' time and energy in a way of playing games to solve computational problems. In this paper we propose a human computation method to detect buffer overflows that does not ask a person whether there is a potential vulnerability, but rather a random person's idea. We implement this method as a game called Bodhi in which each player is shown a piece of code snippet and asked to choose whether their partner would think there is a buffer overflow vulnerability at a given position in the code. The purpose of the game is to make use of the rich distributed human resource to increase effectiveness of manual detection for buffer overflows. The game has been proven to be efficient and enjoyable in practice.},

  abstract={Machine learning is a new paradigm of problem solving. Teaching machine learning in schools and colleges to prepare the industry's needs becomes imminent, not only in computing majors, but also in all engineering disciplines. This paper develops a new, hands-on approach to teaching machine learning by training a linear classifier and applying that classifier to solve Multirotor Activity Recognition (MAR) problems in an online lab setting. MAR labs leverage cloud computing and data storage technologies to host a versatile environment capable of logging, orchestrating, and visualizing the solution for an MAR problem through a user interface. This work extends Arizona State University's Visual IoT/Robotics Programming Language Environment (VIPLE) as a control platform for multi-rotors used in data collection. VIPLE is a platform developed for teaching computational thinking, visual programming, Internet of Things (IoT) and robotics application development.},

  title={Gradual structuring: Evolving the spreadsheet paradigm for expressiveness and learnability}, 
  year={2016},

  abstract={Spreadsheets are arguably the most used form of programming and are frequently used in higher education to teach fundamental concepts about computation. Their success has shown that they are simple enough for a huge number of end users to learn and use. This is in contrast to traditional programming languages and the high dropout rate from introductory programming and computer science. However in comparison to traditional programming languages and structured modelling, spreadsheets are not expressive, placing a limit on the levels of computational thinking that can be taught using the spreadsheet paradigm. This limitation is imposed by the lack of programming language features and abstractions in the paradigm. Furthermore, more advanced spreadsheet features (e.g. array formulae, lookup formulae, R1C1 syntax) can be difficult to learn and use. This paper discusses the idea of adding language features to spreadsheets, enabling the gradual structuring of free-form spreadsheets to more structured models. We propose that this concept is termed Gradual Structuring, and is analogous to the programming language concept of gradual typing. In this analogy, spreadsheets take the place of dynamic programming and structured modelling of static programming. In programming languages, gradual typing allows dynamic programming to be mixed with static programming. It is our contention that dynamic programming is more learnable while static programming is more expressive and abstract. Gradual typing could be used to mitigate the issues in the teaching of traditional programming. Likewise Gradual Structuring can mitigate the conceptual limits that can be taught using current spreadsheets. The key language feature required to enable Gradual Structuring is the ability to logically group cells together so that a single formula can be applied to the grouped cells. This concept, termed cell grouping diminishes and can even eliminate the need for the ubiquitous and error-prone use of copy-pasted in spreadsheets. Moreover, it makes the structure present in spreadsheet models explicit. Cell grouping requires a cascade of other new languages features. Namely a more expressive referencing style, which in turned requires enabling labels to be moved to the row and column headers, and the hierarchical structuring of these headers. Respectively these language features are termed enhanced referencing and semantic axes. The ongoing research focusses on the usability and learnability of these language features. Spreadsheet applications exist that contain aspects of the features mentioned. However these applications do not enable Gradual Structuring and have taken a mainly technical, not human behavioural, approach to evolving the spreadsheet.},
