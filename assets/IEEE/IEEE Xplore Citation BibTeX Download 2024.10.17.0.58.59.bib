  abstract={The four technology drivers Social Media, Mobile Computing, Data Analytics and Cloud Computing are of major importance for the digital transformation, and each incorporates disruptive potential for future businesses. Even more innovation potential lies at integrated solutions of these four technologies - called the SMAC system. This combination amplifies the effects of each single technology, and forms a digital ecosystem for new products, services and business models. A microservice architecture is proposed to allow easy integration. This approach opens a wide range of possible combinations and constitutes an ecosystem of innovation which can systematically be exploited by the method of morphological modeling.},

  pages={369-373},
  abstract={The purpose of this study is to apply the Simplified Pivot Pairwise Relative Criteria Importance Assessment (PIPRECIA-S) weighting model with ranking criteria or priorities in determining Employee Performance Evaluation. The method used for the assessment of employee performance evaluation is the center of ranking and ranking order using Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT), so as to produce rankings that can be compared with the best alternative results with weighted values generated by each method. To apply the MAUT approach in decision support systems, the determination of employee performance evaluation assessment has the criteria of initiative, team working ability, communication skills, discipline, responsibility, creativity and innovation, customer service, and commitment to company values. This research aims at evaluating employee performance using MAUT and PIPRECIA-S in order to weight the criteria based on the assessment of decision makers more objectively. Based on the process of completing the application of the MAUT method using PIPRECIA-S weighting in the assessment of employee performance evaluation, among the 6 employees as the subjects of the research, the best performance was obtained by employee 4 with a final score of 0.435 as rank 1, and rank 2 was obtained by Employee 1 with a final score of 0.328, while rank 3 was obtained by Employee 3 with a final score of 0.251.},

  abstract={In the current scenario computing has become integral part of curriculum at all levels of education. It has transformed way of teaching and learning processes. However, it remains debatable about the content or curriculum of computing as a separate subject or as an integral part of all other subjects. A literature study reveals that most of the current high school education focuses on computer as a separate subject and less emphasis on computing and its integration with other subjects. The present work intends to propose a conceptual approach “Computing Implementation for High School Curriculum” with an objective of integrating computing as a part high school education with a multi-dimensional approach. It includes teaching & learning, emphasis on problem solving and supporting academic administration. This can help the stakeholders in the field of education to improve the overall development of our future generation.},

  abstract={A formal theory for abstract concepts and knowledge manipulation is created by Wang recently known as concept algebra. Concept algebra is an abstract mathematical structure for the formal treatment of concepts and their algebraic relations, operations, and associative rules for composing complex concepts, which provides a denotational mathematic means for knowledge system representation and manipulation. This paper presents a method that shows how the theory of concept algebra is implemented and simulated using typical computers. A visualized knowledge representation tool for concept algebra is developed, which enables machines learn concepts and knowledge autonomously. Nine forms of concept association operations are implemented in the tool to rigorously manipulate knowledge by concept networks. The knowledge representation tool is capable to present concepts and knowledge systems in multiple ways, in order to visualize concept networks by computer simulations.},

  abstract={Based on investigations of the current situation of deep learning in computer basic courses in a certain medical university, the study aims to analyze the reasons of shallow learning in computer basic courses and find out the deep learning strategies. The questionnaire is designed from four dimensions: learning motivation, teaching methods, learning methods and learning effects. The results of the questionnaire show that the reasons for the lack of deep learning of computer basic courses are as follows: lack of novel content, too large class size, uneven basic level of students, only shallow learning for examinations and single evaluation method. The conclusion is introducing the teaching concept of deep learning into computer basic courses can change the teaching paradigm for the purpose of knowledge transfer and enable students to deeply participate in and effectively experience learning.},

  abstract={This paper develops an improved TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) based on grey relational analysis and cloud model theory for dealing with the fuzziness and randomness in muti-attribute decision making. Firstly, some concepts of cloud model theory and grey relational analysis were introduced and an improved forward cloud generator was put forward to normalize the decision matrix of TOPSIS, thus the uncertainty of the decision data was embodied and simulated. Then the steps of the improved TOPSIS were described. The calculation method of the numerical characteristics of the cloud model used to normalize the decision matrix was given. The separation to the positive ideal solution and negative ideal solution was calculated by grey relational analysis method which can reflect the trend relationship between the alternative and the ideal solution. The weight of the criteria was calculated on the basis of the exponential scale of analytic hierarchy process. Finally, a numerical example was given to illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method. The method can provide more evaluation information by its statistical nature.},

  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={83639-83665},
  abstract={Owing to the no free lunch theorem, no single optimisation algorithm can solve all optimisation problems accurately, so new optimisation techniques are required. In this paper, a novel metaheuristic called the deep sleep optimiser (DSO) is proposed. The deep sleep optimiser mimics the sleeping patterns of humans to solve optimisation problems. The DSO is modelled on the rise and fall of homeostatic pressure during the human sleep process. Human sleep is often modelled on the four sleep stages and the deep sleep stage is employed in this work. The mathematical model of sleep homeostatic pressure is employed to simulate and determine the deep sleep state. The performance of DSO is demonstrated by employing 23 traditional functions (i.e., unimodal, multimodal, and fixed multi-modal functions), six composite functions, three engineering design problems, two knapsack problems, and six widely known travelling salesman’s problems. Additionally, the performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy, computational running time, the Wilcoxon rank sum, and the Friedman test. Lastly, the DSO is compared with 11 other metaheuristics, including GA, PSO, TLBO, and GWO. The DSO fares comparably well and, in most instances, it outperforms other metaheuristics.},

In addition, we combine the emerging blockchain technology with PHS, via constructing a consortium blockchain linking patients, hospitals, health bureaus, and healthcare communities for comprehensive healthcare data sharing, medical records review, and care auditability. Finally, a prototype named parallel gout diagnosis and treatment system is built and deployed to verify and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the blockchain-powered PHS framework.},

  abstract={In mid-April 2020, UNESCO monitored 191 countries and stated that around 1.723 trillion students in the world were affected by the policy of school from home. It is feared that school closures could hamper the provision of education services and could disrupt the education process which will affect the level of quality of education. There is still no creation of a computational model for the spread of covid as the main framework for schools reopening safely during the pandemic situation. Although there is already a framework from WHO and the government, there is no measuring tool that can evaluate the effect of reopening schools while the Covid-19 pandemic. For this reason, this research seeks to produce a model for the spread of Covid-19 as a basis for determining policies for safely reopening schools during the pandemic. In this research, we produced a recommendation to reopen face-to-face learning in the form of a dashboard. Recommendations are given by predicting the number of cases in each subdistrict using a predictive model. The prediction results are also combined with the factors that have been determined by the government to give recommendations. The allotment of recommendations process involves a critical factor analysis process where we identify which factors are dominant as a basis of a controllable pandemic.},

  abstract={This paper introduces Data Brushes, an interactive web application to explore neural style transfer using models trained on data visualizations. Our application includes two distinct modes that invite casual creators to engage with deep convolutional neural networks to co-create custom artworks. The first mode, `magic markers', mimics painting with a brush on a canvas, enabling users to paint a style onto selected areas of an image. The second mode, `compositing stamps', uses a real-time method for applying style filters to selected portions of an image. Specifically, we focus on style transfer networks created from canonical and contemporary works of data visualization and data art in order to investigate the versatility and flexibility of the algorithm. In addition to enabling a novel creative workflow, the process of interactively modifying an image via multiple style transfer networks reveals meaningful features encoded within the networks, and provides insight into the effects particular networks have on different images, or different regions within a single image. To evaluate Data Brushes, we gathered expert feedback from participants of a data science symposium and ran an observational study, finding that our application facilitates the creative exploration of neural style transfer for data art and enhances user intuition regarding the expressive range of style transfer features.},

  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={123588-123602},
  abstract={Learning to program at an early age has been shown to be a vehicle for the development of Computational Thinking. Game-based environments are often used to develop these skills, but they lack sufficient voluntariness to assess aspects related to intrinsic motivation, such as interests, skills, persistence in solving a problem and behavior in response to rewards. These aspects directly affect achievement and academic performance, so it is necessary to analyze possible age and gender differences in order to adjust Computational Thinking curricula. With this aim, we deployed a voluntary video game which addresses basic computational concepts, based on intrinsic motivation, and aimed at early ages. Data were collected and analyzed using game learning analytics for 15 months, during which 4124 users played more than 28187 games. The analysis shows significant age and gender differences in relation to interests, skills, achievement, and progression through attempts. It was observed that the concepts addressed were achievable between the ages of 3 and 6 years and full mastery was possible by the age of 4 years, regardless of gender, as children persist with the challenge, intrinsically motivated, until it is overcome. In terms of persistence, significantly different behaviors were observed in the face of the challenge, which can help us to adjust the different learning methodologies to each age group and gender, adapting the way we provide reinforcement and rewards, especially for boys in the more complex challenges and for girls from the age of 5 years onwards.},

  abstract={Sustainable development is raising increasing interest and efforts are being devoted worldwide in order to introduce the notion of sustainability in the curricula, from schools to PhD programs. The focus of this work is on reporting a teaching and learning experience aimed at introducing the students to the culture of sustainability, by means of a project that utilizes a leading visual programming environment and web 2.0 technologies, and is suitable for a relatively large group. The key idea was to tell a story through a computational artifact, whose development requires critical and creative thinking, problem solving, communication and collaboration skills [6] as well as information literacy. This paper describes the pedagogical design of the activities, their objectives, class management issues, and the scaffolds to designing the animated story, to be implemented using a cutting edge, syntax-free visual language called Scratch. Both the humanistic and the scientific aspects were to be covered in each story about a selected topic in sustainability, in order to involve as much as possible of the teaching spectrum and create a truly interdisciplinary environment. The developed Scratch-based solution is also suitable for deployment on mobile devices using the App Inventor visual programming language.},

  abstract={The rapid integration of AI technology and education will have a profound impact on the traditional education and teaching ideas, forms, contents, methods, and will also put forward new and higher requirements for teachers' professional quality and teaching ability. For normal university students, AI quality cultivation and application ability training are particularly important. Based on the previous research, this paper holds that digital literacy, computational thinking, programming ability and deep cognition of intelligent society are the important contents of AI technology literacy of normal university students. And put forward that under the AI environment, normal university students' learning ability, teaching ability, teaching research ability three aspects, as well as basic ability, deepening application, application innovation three levels of ability training strategy. And points out that normal university students should learn AI technology and theory in practice, cultivate AI quality and application ability in teaching, and improve human-machine cooperation skills in exploration.},
