  abstract={Model Driven Engineering proposes the use of models as the main development artifacts. This methodology involves generating code from models and then perhaps adding some details to the generated code. Frequently, it is required to also reverse-engineer code to generate models. Despite the wide acceptance of modeling benefits, the use of Model Driven Engineering practices remains limited. We present model oriented programming as a new paradigm to reduce the ever-present tension between model-centric and code-centric development styles. The core of this approach is to add UML abstractions such as associations and state machines directly into a high-level programming language code. In this approach, model diagrams become just another abstract view of the code. The need for reverse engineering is eliminated, since everything in the diagram is represented directly in the code. Model orientation is illustrated using Umple, a working model oriented programming platform. A functional layer of an airline reservation system is presented as a case study.},

  abstract={This study aims to investigate Taiwanese EFL college students' perceptions of the potentials of computer games for language learning. The participants are required to play two selected video games, Sid Meier's Pirates and Telltale Sam & Max in the researcher's computer assisted language learning class. To elicit participants' perceptions of computer games, researchers asked them to write a reflection paper after they had played these two games for more than ten hours. The findings show that most students believe that suitable computer games can assist second language learning. The strengths and weaknesses of using computer games in language education are also discussed in this paper.},

  abstract={The purpose of this study is to discover in detail the two-dimensional mental model created by the blind people using touch screen with audio feedback. It is hypothesized that by augmenting a touch screen display with audio feedback, blind user would be able to have two-dimensional perspective in their mental model. If their mental model of a web page is two-dimensional, the blind people should be able to gain an overview of the web pages accurately, which is important for navigation of the web page. This paper discusses an on-going study to elicit mental models from the blind users using diagrammatic epresentation. The study so far revealed that there is a significant difference between performances using screen-reader program and touch-screen display with audio feedback. However, the performance seems to be affected by page complexity.},

  abstract={Now a day's, online reviews has become one of the most important part of any business. Posting reviews online for products bought or services received has become a trendy approach for people to express opinions and sentiments, which is essential for business intelligence, vendors and other interested parties. Social media like Twitter contains rich information about people's preferences. In this paper movie domain is considered for data mining. For dealing the problem of review mining for predicting sales performance, we have used massive collection of online reviews from IMDB along with thoughts of people about movies from Twitter; both are mined and processed by applying various algorithms. Our analysis shows that both Sentiments captured from reviews and tweets have a major impact on the future sales performance of the movie. For the sentiment factor, we have used Sentiment Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (S-PLSA) model it is a probabilistic approach to analyzing the sentiments in reviews and tweets, which provides succinct summary of the sentiment information. The summarization of both reviews and tweets in terms of sentiments along with additional input of the box office collection from IMDB is given to an Autoregressive Sentiment-Aware model (ARSA) for sales prediction. After that we have done sentiment analysis of online reviews. In sentiment analysis reviews are classified into negative and positive. We used a simple metric P-N ratio to predict the success of movies i.e. Hit, Average, Flop.},

  abstract={The rapid growth of internet access has given rise to a digital era. The availability of internet access has pushed almost 70% of the population to switch to internet for their daily needs and accessories. Mainly, E-commerce platforms are being used at a much higher rate than ever before. People who buy from these e-commerce platforms make decisions on whether to buy a product or not solely based on the ratings and reviews of a product that are provided by these platforms. Due to the simple nature of this review system, sellers and even individuals tend to exploit it by writing dishonest reviews with an intention of either boosting its ratings or simply to sabotage it. These fake reviews are aimed at deceiving customers and convince them to buy/deter a certain product. Due to the lack of a robust system to identify real and fake reviews, these spams manage to show up on top. To avoid this problem and provide a more efficient way to filter and provide a more efficient way to reviews. This work focus on designing machine learning model for fake review detection and compare the performance of three different algorithms. As a result of this research work random forest algorithm outperform than other two algorithms. Web based User Interface(UI) designed to remove fake review and display trusted review based on the ranking.},

  abstract={The development of educational games is expensive as educational games are complex programs. Modelling is a known method to handle the complexity of educational games and reduce development cost via automatic code generation. This paper reviews several modelling languages for modelling educational games under the adventure genre. The objective of the review is to assess the coverage of these modelling languages against known adventure genre and flow theory concepts. The assessment result shows that existing modelling languages do not cover all concepts in the adventure genre and flow theory. The effect of not covering these concepts towards game development and game effectiveness as a learning tool are also discussed.},

  year={2013},

  pages={1283-1291},
  abstract={Modeling and simulating a real world scenario is fundamentally an abstraction that takes only part of the given scenario into the model. Furthermore, the level of detail in the model, a.k.a. the resolution, plays an important role in the modeling and simulation process. Finally, the abstraction and resolution of the model determine the fidelity of the modeling and simulation, which becomes the ultimate utility for the model users. While abstraction, resolution and fidelity are the corner stones of the modeling and simulation discipline, they are often casually utilized. Moreover, their interplay is not investigated in-depth with explicit operationalization of the concepts. This article operationalizes the concept of abstraction, resolution, and fidelity by focusing on the aspect of model information. This theoretic investigation answers propositions involving these concepts, i.e. whether or not a higher resolution model has higher fidelity and why, through set theoretic approaches.},

  abstract={This paper introduces trust and unauthorized operation to traditional RBAC model, and proposes a trust and unauthorized operation based RBAC model (TUORBAC model). The model has greatly improved in safety compared to traditional RBAC model. Before user activates the roles, TUORBAC model downgrade the roles of user according to the average severity of user historical unauthorized operation. When the average severity of user historical unauthorized operation is high, we directly downgrade roles of user to the lowest. Otherwise, we calculate the value of trust, and downgrade the roles of user according to the value of trust, finally activate downgrade roles. In addition, the model introduces downgrade roles, which stored downgrade roles of user. If downgrade roles are nonempty, we directly activate downgrade roles without re-judged, which improves the efficiency of the system.},

The thrust is mainly due to the new establishment/enrichment of various core engineering industry sectors like Automobile, Healthcare, Agriculture, Avionics, Structural, Telecommunication and Mobile Technologies. Currently even though the country graduates a bulk volume of engineers every year, a major composition of this volume is drained to IT service sectors for employment. To enhance the above thrust of the country many engineering education institutions started focusing on quality of the offered education in terms of numerical ability, creativity and design ability of engineers. The Course Outcomes and Programme Specific Outcomes have been designed with the above focus as a guideline. More emphasis on integration of technology into instruction with learner-centric approach is encouraged. Simulation tools as teaching aids will enrich the understanding ability of the learner. In this work the confidence level of the learners to attain the course level objectives through simulation based teaching pedagogy has been explored. The survey records ensure the impact of this innovative instructional design for the desired course outcomes.},

The performances of traditional automated service composition methods suffer from the complexity of the service composition problem. Hence it is hardly to apply these automated methods in real cases. Semi-automated service composition is an alternative for coping with the complexity of service composition. A novel end-user oriented service composition model based on quotient space theory and service relation diagram is presented. This model proposes a hierarchical service composition from coarse-grain to fine-grain. The performance analysis and simulation showed that this model can reduce the complexity of service composition efficiently.},

  abstract={The importance of teaching a solid design methodology is well-recognized and is the goal of many software development courses. There is an ongoing debate concerning how to approach the learning and teaching of this skill, i.e., by focusing on “design first” by means of the UML formalism or by “OO programming first”, deferring the development of UML specifications. This work presents a teaching experience and curriculum content where a “design-first” approach was used to teach Object Oriented Design, incrementally interleaved with Object Oriented Programming aimed at implementing the modeled software through laboratory activities. Working in groups allowed the students to improve communication and collaboration skills, and the use of web 2.0 technologies, such as a wiki, allowed for better course management and for the deployment of a project involving all the students. This approach was used in two year-long courses with students who had slightly different backgrounds and dispositions. Also presented are a preliminary analysis of the written examinations and laboratory exercises; an analysis of common errors and student misconceptions and a preliminary quantitative measure of the results.},

  abstract={1 in 88 children is diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Specific software, virtual worlds, and games may be used to improve social and language skills. These tools may be combined with the DIR/Floortime therapeutic model that encourages parents, teachers, and therapists to engage these children through their own (sometimes limited) interests. Applying this framework, this paper suggests the creation of a workshop modeled after the Computer Clubhouse, as developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which would take advantage of the children's sometimes above-average analytic and visual abilities. Participants would produce their own video games with Scratch or other age-appropriate tool. In this way, children on the autism spectrum could pursue their interests in computers and games while strengthening their creativity and problem-solving skills: areas that are sometimes difficult for those with the disorder.},
