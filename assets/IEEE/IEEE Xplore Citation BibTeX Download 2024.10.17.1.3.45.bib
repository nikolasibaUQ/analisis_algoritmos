  abstract={Recently, the realization of transformation method from whisper voice to voice sounds is expected. We easily think of the method using PARCOR analysis when we consider this method. This method is as follows: 1) The vocal tract characteristic is estimated by using the PARCOR analysis. 2) The voice sounds can be generated from the whisper voice by convoluting a periodic pitch with the estimated vocal tract characteristic. However, in 1), this method needs a lot of computational complexity to estimate the vocal tract characteristic. In this paper, we propose the estimation method of vocal tract characteristic with a little computational complexity using the blind estimation based on over sampling instead of PARCOR analysis method.},

  abstract={One from the most difficult tasks for Natural Language Processing (NLP) is to analyze poetry, which uses a different genre of language than that considered by computer-based techniques. Therefore, computational analysis is an interesting task when we use NLP in poetry, but it is also challenging. There are a number of researchers that entered this field from NLP and they got promising results using mathematical analysis for poetry, including rhythm analysis. In this paper we focused on providing solution for automating the rhythm detection of the Arabic poems and finding the number of rhythm for each verse in poem and the total percentage for each rhythm in all verses of poem, additional to other characteristics for the Arabic poem like percentage of mobile letter in Arabic “harf mutaharrik”, and The quiescent letter, in Arabic “harf sakin”, In spite of the number of studies in the computational analysis of poetry, we think it needs more, not only to make a better understanding of domain but also in developing applications, considering different literary tastes and the psychological effects, to give a recommendation to the readers and in plagiarism detection[1].},

  year={2022},

  number={},
  pages={87-91},
  abstract={With the rapid development of DNA microarray technology, the application of informatics research methods in oncology is becoming more and more popular. Because the gene expression data extraction experiment has the characteristics of a large number of genes and complex and changeable experimental conditions, clustering technology has been introduced into the field of molecular biology to assist research and analyze gene expression data. Currently, many clustering algorithms are applied in gene expression analysis. Nevertheless, owing to the high dimensionality of gene expression data, many algorithms face the problem of low computational efficiency. The method based on the graph theory thinks of the sample of gene expression data as the point in high-dimensional space. Its low sample performance determines that the constructed matrix is small in size. Therefore, it has lower computational complexity. Therefore, the graph regularized non-negative matrices factorization (GNMF) proposed by Cai et al. has been widely used for gene clustering. However, the deficiency of the GNMF algorithm is unstable with data variation for gene clustering. In this paper, we propose post-processing of Graph Regularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization Algorithm for Gene Clustering, called pGNMF. In the pGNMF method, we first normalize the solution of GNMF, thereby reducing the sensitivity of the traditional GNMF method to the prior selection of genes or initial conditions, and effectively improving the robustness of the algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing GNMF algorithms for gene clustering.},

  abstract={This research goes into the intricate interplay of linguistic and psychological aspects in Doris Lessing’s fiction by conducting a computational analysis of verba sentiendi, or verbs of thinking. Drawing on applied linguistics, computational analysis, text, and discourse inquiry, we unravel the portrayal of characters’ thoughts/mental events through three categories of verba sentiendi: Thoughts and Opinions, Senses and Perceptions, Feelings and Emotions. By quantitatively examining the frequency values and interpreting descriptive statistics data, we shed light on the psychological dimensions that underlie Lessing’s fictional tapestry. Using cutting-edge tools such as Voyant and R/R Studio, we process vast volumes of textual data to quantify the prevalence of verba sentiendi across different categories, offering insights into their quantitative significance. Descriptive statistics provide further nuance by revealing central tendencies, variations, and quartiles within the three main categories under study.},

  abstract={We began our journey with the goal of commoditizing pervasive connectivity for the remaining billions. We gravitated towards providing neighborhood connectivity in developing and rural regions. Businesses saw an opportunity and local government began to value blanket city-wide coverage. But success was not inevitable. Deployments failed and critics questioned the promises. Perhaps the technology was not ready for prime time. So we began "fixing" the technology, part of which included revisiting governmental policies around spectrum allocation. The US government listened and in a landmark ruling on Nov. 4, the FCC voted to open the unused low frequency bands for unlicensed use. In this talk, the author discussed the evolution of our thinking on how to achieve open pervasive Internet connectivity. The author highlight promising new directions that are full of interesting challenges. The author discussed solutions that researchers are developing and show their trajectory. The author's objective is to present what the author believe is the new frontier of wireless networking and ubiquitous Internet, at the intersection of cognitive systems, mesh networking, and white spaces. The author challenged the audience into taking on new technical problems and thinking about new business models, which will lead us to success in our original goal of commoditizing pervasive connectivity for the masses, bridging the digital divide, and enabling exciting new applications and services in the process.},

  pages={187-199},
  abstract={Intelligent agents working in real-time domains need to adapt to changing circumstance so that they can improve their performance and avoid their mistakes. AI agents designed for interactive games, however, typically lack this ability. Game agents are traditionally implemented using static, hand-authored behaviors or scripts that are brittle to changing world dynamics and cause a break in player experience when they repeatedly fail. Furthermore, their static nature causes a lot of effort for the game designers as they have to think of all imaginable circumstances that can be encountered by the agent. The problem is exacerbated as state-of-the-art computer games have huge decision spaces, interactive users, and real-time performance that make the problem of creating AI approaches for these domains harder. In this paper, we address the issue of nonadaptivity of game playing agents in complex real-time domains. The agents carry out runtime adaptation of their behavior sets by monitoring and reasoning about their behavior execution to dynamically carry out revisions on the behaviors. The behavior adaptation approaches have been instantiated in two real-time interactive game domains. The evaluation results show that the agents in the two domains successfully adapt themselves by revising their behavior sets appropriately.},

  pages={113199-113212},
  abstract={The evolution of the Internet and cloud-based technologies have empowered several organizations with the capacity to implement large-scale Internet of Things (IoT)-based ecosystems, such as Industrial IoT (IIoT). The IoT and, by virtue, the IIoT, are vulnerable to new types of threats and intrusions because of the nature of their networks. So it is crucial to develop Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that can provide the security, privacy, and integrity of IIoT networks. In this research, we propose an IDS for IIoT that was implemented using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature selection, and the Random Forest (RF) model was employed in the GA fitness function. The models used for the intrusion detection processes include classifiers such as the RF, Linear Regression (LR), Naïve Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Extra-Trees (ET), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). The GA-RF generated 10 feature vectors for the binary classification scheme and 7 feature vectors for the multiclass classification procedure. The UNSW-NB15 is used to assess the effectiveness and the robustness of our proposed approach. The experimental outcomes demonstrated that for the binary modeling process, the GA-RF achieved a test accuracy (TAC) of 87.61% and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.98, using a feature vector that contained 16 features. These results were superior to existing IDS frameworks.},

  year={2023},
  volume={114},
  number={4},
  pages={114-127},
  abstract={In this study, the specific absorption rate (SAR) and exposure index (EI) of access points (APs) and user equipment (UEs) in fourth-generation (4G) and fifth-generation (5G) wireless technologies are examined with regard to the effects of exposure to radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMF) radiation and the implications of their reduction. We characterize the EI using a classical mathematical method while considering the power density, the SAR, the electric field strength, and the tissue's density and conductivity. As such, a novel exposure-index open-loop power control algorithm is proposed to evaluate the realistic RF-EMF radiation exposure on human users from both the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) communication devices. To solve an EI minimization problem using the open-loop power control algorithm, we formulate it in the form of a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. As the energy capacity (i.e., power density) in wireless networks determines the radiation exposure (SAR and EI), it minimizes the EI by controlling and managing the transmitted and received powers under the restrictions of Quality of Service (QoS), interference, and power, while ensuring the users' QoS requirements are met. Our proposed scheme is numerically compared to other heuristic algorithms and exposure limits established by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and other similar organizations. Lastly, we compare the emissions from 4G and 5G networks to the emissions from UL and DL transmissions. Our simulation findings indicate that our proposed technique is a good alternative. Our assessment, in terms of numerical results and evaluation, also verifies that the exposures are bearable, fall within the recommended limits, and are minimized without impairing the users' QoS.},

  abstract={Advancement in wireless transmission has enabled the communication among multiple devices all over the world, as well as expanding the frontiers of wireless Internet access. As a result of these advancement, numerous devices are questing for wireless connectivity thereby congesting the existing spectrum. If new measures are not taken to reduce depletion of the reserved radio resource, new allocations of wireless Internet access will be impossible, thereby risking the development of the entire wireless ecosystem. The demands for resourceful spectrum consumption have continually driven researchers and stakeholders in the wireless industry to search for spare radio spectrum to offer affordable and reliable wireless connectivity. The TV broadcasting is not fully utilizing the spectrum in some geographical zone. These TV unused spaces called TV White Spaces (TVWS), are well-thought-out to be the probable future resolutions for unavailability of spectrum. The low frequency band (470 to 694 MHz) of the unutilized TV channel has exceptional broadcast features over extensive distances and enables transmissions through high-rise buildings, trees, and mountains. These features allow the applications of TVWS in Internet of Things (IoT), wireless sensor network, wireless connectivity, wireless switching, smart grid and cities, automated transportation, and logistics as well as connectivity in cloud infrastructure. This paper presents a study on the advantages and benefits of television white space as an alternative to wireless broadband connectivity.},

  abstract={The emergence of cloud computing technology has motivated a very high number of users in different organizations to access its services in running and delivering their various operations and services. However, this surge of cloud users has led to the problem of uneven load sharing among the cloud computing infrastructures. As a result, federated cloud infrastructure was initiated to provide more cloud computing resources to accommodate more cloud users’ requests and also to provide equal requests mapping with the available cloud resources. Nevertheless, the issue of unequal allocation of requests within the datacenter(s) that makes up the federated cloud environment still persists. This research work presents an intra-datacenter load balancing algorithm in a federated cloud environment named; the intra-balancer adapted throttled algorithm to evenly distribute requests in each datacenter that formulate the federated cloud infrastructures. The simulation of the intra-balancer was carried out in CloudAnalyst, the results of the implementation showed that the intra-balancer outperformed the Round-Robin and ESCE with 98.93ms and 2.26ms for the response and processing time respectively. The results assert that the intra-balancer algorithm provides a better load balancing solution in a federated cloud environment.},

As CPS become increasingly sophisticated and interconnected, it is important for students to have a basic understanding of how they work and how to use them safely and responsibly.In this work, the need for CPS education, the requirements from the teaching faculty and students, the course design methodology and its intent and a 20-hour lesson plan for CPS education is proposed along with a methodology to teach an introductory module on safety and security. CPS education in pre-university education should be comprehensive and hands-on, with an interdisciplinary approach, emphasis on safety and security, real-world applications, and integration of emerging technologies. This education will equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to thrive in a rapidly evolving technological world while being aware of the trust, safety and security aspects in designing and using the CPS interface.

  abstract={This study seeks to develop a model that would facilitate professional skill development in aeronavigation system operators by considering the neurophysiology that underlies the formation and development of functional systems. A key role is played by motivation which is realized by electrochemical processes in synapses. We present a model of synapse formation in the process of learning. A number of studies using the Brainbit brain-computer were carried out as a part of various activities, including the performance of tasks with the Expert air traffic controller simulator. Findings from computational processing of electroencephalography signals revealed the degree of synchronization of brain hemispheres depending on the complexity of the tasks. We propose to use a ratio of mean values of direct and inverse correlation across short epochs as a synchronization (coordination) factor for the activities of both hemispheres. We were able to identify regularities behind the change of the coordination factor depending on the complexity of the task and the degree of involvement in its performance. Three levels of task complexity (high, medium and low) were identified. The coordination factor will vary depending on the complexity level of a particular task. We were able to determine that a high involvement in the performance of a medium-complexity task is accompanied by a high level of coordination. This lets us determine the attained development level of professional and mental capabilities of an aeronavigation system operator and to develop an individual training path.},

  abstract={Reinforcement learning (RL) is effective in optimizing cumulative rewards, and it provides policies that account for how the system will interact over the future with the agent. However, when more than one learning agents are present, developing efficient collaborations/interactions is a challenging issue; not every agent may have access to the same amount of information and computational resources; not every agent may make the same assumptions about the decision-making mechanisms of one another; and many agents may not even be aware of the existence of other agents. These cognitive and physical limitations can be seen as a form of bounded rationality. Several recent experimental and empirical studies have found that the initial responses of decision-makers in multi-player games are often far from the equilibrium, which is very often out-predicted by structural non-equilibrium (e.g., cognitive hierarchy) models. This is because non-equilibrium play models allow for players who are boundedly rational and have limited information, so that their policy is not necessarily a best response to the actual adjustment laws of other agents. This tutorial talk will present computationally and communicationally efficient approaches for decision-making in boundedly rational stochastic games. Motivated by the inherent complexity of computing Nash equilibria, as well as the innate tendency of agents to choose non-equilibrium strategies, two models of bounded rationality based on recursive reasoning will be described. In the first model, named level-k thinking, each agent assumes that everyone else has a cognitive level immediately lower than theirs, and—given such an assumption—chooses their policy to be a best response to them. In the second model, named cognitive hierarchy, each agent conjectures that the rest of the agents have a cognitive level that is lower than theirs, but follows a distribution instead of being deterministic. To explicitly compute the boundedly rational policies, this tutorial talk will present both a level-recursive as well as a level-paralleled algorithm, where the latter can have an overall reduced computational complexity.

  abstract={A critical barrier in providing computer science learning opportunities to all is the dearth of professionals who have the expertise to teach computer science. Blended learning approaches have the potential to reduce this barrier by facilitating the distribution of expertise across distances. In this poster we present our approach to understanding how to design blended learning models for the informal space that take advantage of the expertise of adult mentors and computer science experts. Our theoretical framing is based on Nacu et al. (2014) adult mentor roles, which suggest that adults play different roles (e.g., encourager, monitor, broker) to support students learning. We use Minecraft, a popular, 3D, online, multiplayer game, as our study context. The poster presents two studies that investigate ways of facilitating mentorship in a blended learning environment to teach computational thinking. Study 1 focuses on documenting the roles mentors play while facilitating a computer science-related Minecraft workshop with middle school students. Study 2 focuses on understanding how these roles are modified when online and in person mentors work together to facilitate a computational learning opportunity. Our initial findings suggest that defining a scalable model to support blended learning models in informal spaces requires a variety of mentor roles. Additionally, when coordinating mentorship across mediums, gaps in student support can arise when there is a lack of (a) explicit strategies of communication in place between in-person and online mentors; and (b) clearly defined roles assigned to mentors.},

  abstract={No system in the real world can compute an appropriate response in reaction to every situation it encounters, or even most situations it is likely to encounter. Biological systems address this issue with four strategies: (1) a repertoire of already computed responses tied to a situation recognition process, (2) organized in a response-time hierarchy that allows a quick response to occur immediately, and one or more slower and more deliberate responses to begin at the same time, with (3) decision processes that allow one of them to take over after a little while, or that (4) merge several of them in a combined and possibly novel response. In this paper, we describe an approach to building self-adaptive computing systems that incorporates these strategies, to cope with their intended use in hazardous, remote, unknown, or otherwise difficult environments, in which it is known a priori that the system cannot keep up with all important events, and that “as fast as possible” is not appropriate for some interactions. The key to implementing these strategies is an abstraction/refinement hierarchy of behavioral models and processes at multiple levels of granularity and precision. The key to coordinating these different models is the collection of integrative mappings among them, which are developed along with the models, and used for managing system behavior. We also describe the system development process that we use to build such systems, which differs from conventional methods by taking the basic artifacts of development, considered as partial models of aspects of the system in its environment, and retains them all in a model hierarchy, which eventually becomes the definition of the run time system. We show how to implement such systems, explain why we think they are good candidates for real-time operational environments, and illustrate the method with an example implementation.},

Drawing on theories from cognitive science that model how professional designers and artists think, we argue how this setting differs from the former and introduce CICADA: a Collaborative, Interactive Context-Aware Drawing Agent. CICADA uses a vector-based synthesis-by-optimisation method to take a partial sketch (such as might be provided by a user) and develop it towards a goal by adding and/or sensibly modifying traces. Given that this topic has been scarcely explored, we also introduce a way to evaluate desired characteristics of a model in this context by means of proposing a diversity measure. CICADA is shown to produce sketches of quality comparable to a human user’s, enhanced diversity and most importantly to be able to cope with change by continuing the sketch minding the user's contributions in a flexible manner.},

  abstract={Historic settlements have adapted to the local climate and geographical environment accommodating residents over the years. Rich and precious scientific design concepts, including the site selection, the layout, and the building materials, should be investigated extensively. Different historic settlements will be presented and discussed, in terms of different design elements and urban planning forms, and through the use of computational fluid dynamics(CFD). This paper presents the strategic ideas behind the research thinking and methodology of the project. As illustrative case studies, the ambient wind environment within the Shang-Gan-Tang village in China and the Pierce bridge, Melling, Hawks head, Castle Combe villages in the UK, have been investigated quantitatively, to evaluate the interactions between settlement selection, layout, landscape design and ambient environment. The sustainable urban planning experiences were then summarized for the modern sustainable human settlement suitable for people living for another hundreds of years.},

  year={2010},
  volume={16},
  number={6},
  pages={999-1008},
  abstract={Although previous research has suggested that examining the interplay between internal and external representations can benefit our understanding of the role of information visualization (InfoVis) in human cognitive activities, there has been little work detailing the nature of internal representations, the relationship between internal and external representations and how interaction is related to these representations. In this paper, we identify and illustrate a specific kind of internal representation, mental models, and outline the high-level relationships between mental models and external visualizations. We present a top-down perspective of reasoning as model construction and simulation, and discuss the role of visualization in model based reasoning. From this perspective, interaction can be understood as active modeling for three primary purposes: external anchoring, information foraging, and cognitive offloading. Finally we discuss the implications of our approach for design, evaluation and theory development},

  title={Video2GIF: Automatic Generation of Animated GIFs from Video}, 
  year={2016},
  volume={},

  pages={1001-1009},
  abstract={We introduce the novel problem of automatically generating animated GIFs from video. GIFs are short looping video with no sound, and a perfect combination between image and video that really capture our attention. GIFs tell a story, express emotion, turn events into humorous moments, and are the new wave of photojournalism. We pose the question: Can we automate the entirely manual and elaborate process of GIF creation by leveraging the plethora of user generated GIF content? We propose a Robust Deep RankNet that, given a video, generates a ranked list of its segments according to their suitability as GIF. We train our model to learn what visual content is often selected for GIFs by using over 100K user generated GIFs and their corresponding video sources. We effectively deal with the noisy web data by proposing a novel adaptive Huber loss in the ranking formulation. We show that our approach is robust to outliers and picks up several patterns that are frequently present in popular animated GIFs. On our new large-scale benchmark dataset, we show the advantage of our approach over several state-of-the-art methods.},

  title={A Thorough Trust and Reputation Based RBAC Model for Secure Data Storage in the Cloud}, 
  year={2019},

  pages={778-788},
  abstract={Cloud computing is a widespread technology, which has attracted much attention nowadays. Among the many criteria that must be considered for data storage in the cloud, access control plays a vital role. Role-based access control (RBAC) is a well-known technique for secure data storage in the cloud. Since the traditional RBAC models are improper for open and decentralized environments, recently, some works have integrated the trust concept into the RBAC model. Nevertheless, they have not fully addressed the required security metrics of a trust-based system. Therefore, in this paper, we first introduce the security goals that should be considered in an efficient trust-based system. Second, we propose a novel trust and reputation based RBAC model that not only can properly withstand the security threats of trust-based RBAC models, but also is scalable as it has reasonable execution time. Third, we evaluate the proposed model using the famous trust network of advogato dataset. Eventually, we compare the proposed model with recently-published ones in terms of mean absolute error, execution time of indirect trust computation, and provided features. The achieved results are indicative of the priority of the proposed model to be employed in real cloud environments.},

  year={2010},
  volume={},

  abstract={Social engineering is a real threat to industries in this day and age even though the severity of it is extremely downplayed. The difficulty with social engineering attacks is mostly the ability to identify them. Social engineers target call centre employees, as they are normally underpaid, under skilled workers whom have limited knowledge about the information technology infrastructure. These workers are thus easy targets for the social engineer. This paper proposes a model which can be used by these workers to detect social engineering attacks in a call centre environment. The model is a quick and effective way to determine if the requester is trying to manipulate an individual into disclosing information to which the requester does not have authorization for.},
