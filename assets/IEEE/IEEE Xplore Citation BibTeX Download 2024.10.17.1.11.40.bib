  abstract={The number of network attacks is increasing at an unprecedented speed, and online phishing is the most common form of network attacks and the most close to our life. In order to enable users to better understand what kind of online phishing they have suffered, and enable scholars and researchers to more quickly customize detection for different types of online phishing detection. We need an in-depth summary of the existing types of online phishing and various detection methods. This paper classifies and summarizes all kinds of phishing, mainly introduces six kinds of phishing, including E-mail phishing and search engine phishing. For phishing detection methods, this paper also summarizes and classifies existing and widely used detection methods into seven categories such as list-based heuristic machine learning, and introduces them in detail. Then the paper analyzes the big data frontier technology and detection channel direction of assisted anomaly detection, and divides it into stream processing technology, Hadoop DPI parsing keyword recognition, web crawler recognition, etc. Finally the paper discusses and thinks deeply about the methods and techniques mentioned above as well as the current situation of phishing detection, and puts forward some forward-looking suggestions on the interpretation of data processing model selection and general detection architecture.},

  abstract={The national colleges and universities’ large-scale application of online education during the Covid-19. Academic dishonesty frequently occurs, leading to society’s attention to the problem of academic honesty. As a vital reserve force of academic talents, undergraduate students should pay more attention to their academic honesty. Nowadays, undergraduate students’ academic consciousness is weak, and their academic dishonesty is gradually showing new characteristics and problems under the large-scale application of online education. In the face of increasingly frequent and diverse academic dishonesty problems, various academic misconduct detection systems supported by computer technology have played a positive role in solving the problem of academic dishonesty among undergraduate students. We must study and think about improving undergraduate students’ academic honesty education with the development of online education combined with computer technology. This paper probes into the problems existing in undergraduate students’ academic honesty education under online education. Then it constructs the academic honesty education model from undergraduate students themselves, legal system, academic honesty training, and academic honesty supervision management mechanism, four aspects of standardizing undergraduate students’ academic behavior and forming an excellent academic moral atmosphere in colleges and universities.},

  title={Language-aware Visual Semantic Distillation for Video Question Answering}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},

  pages={27103-27113},
  abstract={Significant progress in video question answering (VideoQA) have been made thanks to thriving large image-language pretraining frameworks. Although image-language models can efficiently represent both video and language branches, they typically employ goal-free vision perception and do not interact vision with language well during the answer generation, thus omitting crucial visual cues. In this paper, we are inspired by the human recognition and learning pattern and propose VideoDistill, a framework with language-aware (i.e., goal-driven) behavior in both vision perception and answer generation. VideoDistill generates answers only from question-related visual embeddings and follows a thinking-observing-answering approach that closely resembles human behavior, distinguishing it from previous research. Specifically, we develop a language-aware gating mechanism to replace the standard cross-attention, avoiding language's direct fusion into visual representations. We incorporate this mechanism into two key components of the entire framework. The first component is a differentiable sparse sampling module, which selects frames containing the necessary dynamics and semantics relevant to the questions. The second component is a vision refinement module that merges existing spatial-temporal attention layers to ensure extracting multi-grained visual semantics associated with the questions. We conduct evaluations on various challenging video question-answering benchmarks, and VideoDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance in both general and long-form VideoQA datasets. In Addition, we verify that VideoDistill can effectively alleviate the utilization of language shortcut solutions in the EgoTaskQA dataset.},

  abstract={The generalization ability of current intent recognition methods is insufficient, and the evaluation of confidence level of intent recognition is the key to its popularization and application in the high-reliability military and civilian fields. The spatiotemporal Knowledge Graph can uniformly represent and efficiently organize entities containing spatial location information and temporal information. Battlefield situational objectives and their relationships can be abstractly expressed as a triplet composed of two specific types of spatiotemporal entities and combat intent relationships. Using typical confrontation scenario data to train neural networks, and fusing the confidence levels of the entity and Knowledge Graph, the confidence level evaluation results of the intent triple facing the existing spatiotemporal knowledge base are calculated. The simulation test results show that the method can effectively evaluate the confidence level of intent recognition results, and the accuracy rate is improved by more than 9% compared with the KGTTM model. This method breaks the “closed” assumption of the Knowledge Graph update and completion algorithm from the level of algorithm thinking, and completes the last link of the popularization and application of intent recognition methods.},

  abstract={Complexity of technology is constantly increasing; for the field of automation this means that economic considerations dictate a need for corresponding measures. Artificial intelligence boasts noteworthy successes in this area; however, its achievements appear modest when compared to the faculties of human intelligence. This paper will demonstrate that a new modeling approach is required via possibilities offered by the mindset and tools of computer technology, thereby demonstrating why a psychoanalytic approach seems sensible and necessary. The paramount goal of the research introduced in the following is a formal approach to describing the human psyche based on the neuro- symbolic and neuronal functional layers. Questions associated with this approach include: To what extent can the psychoanalytic model be confirmed by computer technology and the possibility of simulation? To what extent is an axiomatically developed terminology in psychoanalysis a prerequisite for the better integration of the natural-scientific way of thinking in psychoanalysis? The paper is based on the results of several fundamental research projects within the framework of ARS (Artificial Recognition System) which were funded in part nationally and in part by the EU.},

  abstract={Nowadays, we all know that due to the health emergency situation most of the universities and colleges opted for the virtual education. In this pandemic the student's learning process was affected mostly. So due to that purpose most of the educational centers proposed the virtual system. Many educational centers started their classes on different virtual tools such as Discord, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Skype and Zoom. So, the main objective of this paper is on the impact of student learning in video conferences. Most of the teachers were familiar with those tools; However, about 24% of them stated that their academic performance has been improved. But some of the teachers were facing some of the difficulties on a psychological level due to the new teaching procedure. In this paper we are using Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms to analyze the student’s behavior. After this analysis to prove that students and teachers agree that these virtual tools are very helpful in the online classes. "The challenges of this paper are that the teacher may know the student’s learning activity rate in online classes".The primary of this project is to develop a self-contained agent that can provide information to both teachers and students. Important academic outcomes such as critical thinking and the grades students receive in a topic are closely tied to the extent of student involvement.},

  abstract={This chapter describes the computer modeling of a psychic system that generates representations for a system that has an artificial corporeality. In this model, it defines how the sensation of thinking is formed in an artificial system and how such an artificial system can experience its idea generation. Next, the chapter discusses a multiagent approach to design the artificial psychic system. Further, it describes the organizational memory of the system. The organizational memory will be organized into networks of memory agents related through concepts of semantic proximities or semantic generalizations. The concepts of proximity, specialization and generalization can be precisely defined using qualifications related to the acquaintances of the agents. The chapter finally shows that the general psyche of an artificial system, when it is distributed over multiple corporeal systems with local artificial consciousnesses, can be unified.},

  title={Accurate Reliability Prediction Based on RIDM}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={The reliability of an item is the probability that it will adequately perform its specified purpose for a specified period of time under specified environmental conditions [1]. Uncertainty [2] in reliability prediction for complex electronic systems/equipment is mainly originated from the incomplete considerations on the specified environmental conditions and on the impacts to the equipment. This paper focuses on the incomplete considerations on the space radiation environment (SR see Acronyms in table 1) and their impacts on complex electronic equipment in satellites, airplanes, and ground network computers working daily in SR. Based on Risk Informed Decision Making (RIDM) analysis framework [3], this paper proposes an accurate reliability prediction method to accommodate SR and SR impacts on complex electronic equipment to avoid uncertainties originated from the incomplete considerations on SR theoretically more complete or accurate than the traditional methods, such as FIDES [4], MIL-HDBK-217 [5], etc, which has not considered SR. This paper is creative on the following 3 novel points. (1) SR reliability concept: For accurate reliability prediction, this paper proposes an SR reliability concept based on RIDM framework. The concept accommodates SR and SR impacts critical to mission success by the SR reliability definition and the RIDM 5 steps analysis method to have a close loop systematic thinking on incomplete considerations on SR. (2) SR reliability model: For an accurate reliability prediction based on the SR reliability concept, this paper proposes a new SR reliability model focused on the SR impact rate for complex electronic equipment, connecting the incomplete considerations of SR with mission success in a close loop by 1) The relationship [6] between Reliability and SR impact rate, 2) The relationship [6] between SR impact rate and TID, DD, and SEE impact rate, 3) The relationship between SEE impact rate and SEE effect rate. (3) SR reliability prediction application and verification: This paper provides 3 case studies on satellite, avionics, and ground network computer applications. Additionally, the SR impact rate for avionics of a satellite navigation receiver prototype is predicted and compared with the test results [7] with good agreement. Case studies show that for safety critical applications, the SR impact rate is significant and not negligible. And the SR reliability concept and model is practical and useful for displaying possible key contributions to SR mitigation strategies or Defense-in-depth systematically for mission success.This paper gives an example for the accurate reliability prediction based on RIDM, focusing only on accommodating SR. However, as a general systematic method, it can be applied in broader areas on more SR and non-SR stresses.},

  abstract={Our brain can effortlessly recognize objects even when partially hidden from view. Seeing the visible of the hidden is called amodal completion; however, this task remains a challenge for generative AI despite rapid progress. We propose to sidestep many of the difficulties of existing approaches, which typically involve a two-step process of predicting amodal masks and then generating pixels. Our method involves thinking outside the box, literally! We go outside the object bounding box to use its context to guide a pretrained diffusion inpainting model, and then progressively grow the occluded object and trim the extra background. We overcome two technical challenges: 1) how to be free of unwanted co-occurrence bias, which tends to regenerate similar occluders, and 2) how to judge if an amodal completion has succeeded. Our amodal completion method exhibits improved photorealistic completion results compared to existing approaches in numerous successful completion cases. And the best part? It doesn't require any special training or fine-tuning of models.},

  pages={880-887},
  abstract={Social media has become an essential means for communicating the review/opinions of people around the world due to the rapid expansion and availability of the internet. Reviews and opinions are expressed both as text and audio. But text communication via networking media is overwhelming. Each and every second, a vast amount of information is produced online because of social media sites. However, online reviews on social media provides an excellent and trustworthy channel for examining the areas that require improvement and for understanding the needs of customers. This paper tries to understand the various topics that are discussed by customers about food with the aim of providing an insight to improve the area where there are negative comments. By doing this, customer retention will increase and gradually the business also. Topic modeling is done to find the hidden topic in a set of comments or customer reviews to find out on which topic customers are talking, thinking, or discussing more about restaurant services. It helps to read customers' mindsets, and accordingly, improvements can be made to increase consumer demand for a restaurant. So, a system is proposed to detect topics of textual reviews of different restaurants using the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) modelling approach. A probabilistic, statistical strategy for document designing called latent document analysis (LDA) identifies latent semantic topics in sizable corpora. The dataset used for this study was taken from Kaggle, which had 111,105 reviews. First, topics from reviews were extracted using the LDA model, then data was visualised using the LDAvis tool. The experiment's findings show that the analysis obtained a successful topic division outcome especially in long-to-short text level topic classification.},

  year={2024},
  volume={16},
  number={1},
  pages={266-283},
  abstract={Artificial general intelligence revived in recent years after people achieved significant advances in machine learning and deep learning. This leads to the thinking of how real intelligence could be created. Consciousness theories believe that general intelligence is essentially conscious, yet no universal definition is agreed upon. In this work, global workspace (GW) theory is implemented and integrated with crucial cognitive components. With the focus on episodic memory and inspiration from the nature of episodic memory in psychology and neuroscience, the episodic memory component is implemented within the GW framework. In our experiment, the robotic agent operates in a real-world interactive context, forming episodic memory and demonstrating static, temporal, and context memory capabilities during interactions. Consciousness in this work engages in all formation, maintenance, and retrieval processes of episodic memory. The novelty and contributions of this work are: 1) this work is implementing episodic memory within the consciousness framework, suggesting the sustainable potential of such an integrated approach to cognitive agents with artificial general intelligence (AGI); 2) regarding the limited examples in consciousness-based cognitive architectures, this work attempts to contribute to the diversity of perspectives and approaches; 3) extant episodic memory implementations are suffering from various limitations, while this work summarises some key features for modeling episodic memory within a cognitive architecture; and 4) authors discuss the relationship between episodic memory, consciousness, and general intelligence, proposing the compatibility and relationship between machine consciousness and other AGI research. It is believed that a better alignment between them would further boost the fusion of diverse research for achieving desired cognitive machines.},

  abstract={Three-way decisions model adopts the idea of’’rule by three divisions’’ and “simplify complexity which provides a multi-level and multi granularity thinking framework and implementation method for solving complex uncertain problems. Within this framework, how to extend the application of the generalized model from decision system to interval-valued decision system is an important issue. In this paper, we propose multigranulation sequential three-way decision models in inter-valvalued information system. Firstly, three types of similarity relations from the view of optimistic, pessimistic and weighted are defined. Based on these similarity relations, the lower and upper approximations under multiple granular structures are computed. Then optimistic, pessimistic and weighted arithmetic strategies are adopted to compute three disjoint regions in each level of multigranulation sequential three-way decisions. Furthermore, nine types of multigranulation sequential threeway decision models were analysed. Finally, the experimental results show that the size of the probabilistic regions varies with the similarity relations and aggregation strategies.},

  volume={6},
  number={},
  pages={614-621},
  abstract={The vast majority of email viruses propagate by ensuring that every address included in the address book of the victim is sent the malicious message or attachment. There are a variety of approaches that can be utilized in order to package and present these viruses. Some of them can be immediately identified as malicious based on the content of the body, the sender, who may or may not be trustworthy, and the subject lines, which are just unintelligible. It may be difficult for receivers to identify individual email messages that include malware since the malicious actor puts a lot of effort into making it appear as though the email message was sent from a respectable sender. Phishing is an attempt to steal sensitive information by impersonating a trustworthy entity, typically a business. Cybersecurity is an extremely important topic in the field of information technology. Information security is one of the most pressing problems facing our generation at the moment. When we think of cyber security, the first thing that comes to mind is cybercrime, which is expanding at an alarming rate. This is because cybercrime is the most common kind of online crime. In order to put an end to these cybercrimes, various governments and businesses are pursuing a variety of preventative measures. In spite of the many safeguards in place, a significant number of people continue to be anxious about the safety of their online activity. The difficulties surrounding the use of email viruses as a threat to cyber security are the primary focus of this article. From the point of view of email viruses, a unified approach for assessing the level of cyber security has been developed. In addition to this, it examines the most recent developments in the methods of cyber security, as well as the ethics and trends that are influencing the industry.},

It will require logical thinking to evaluate or have in-depth knowledge about the object present in an image. In this study, we developed a multilayer Convolutional Neural Network to produce words that describe the images, and we used Long Short-Term Memory to accurately construct relevant sentences out of the words that are produced. To generate an accurate description, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model first compares the targeted image against a huge dataset of training samples. In this study, we have used the Flickr 8k dataset. We have used the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) metric to determine how well our model is generating captions for the images. It evaluates the generated text that has been translated from one language to a different language to evaluate the effectiveness of the machine translation system. In this study, we have also used two pre-trained models (VGG16, and XceptionV3) for comparative study.},

  abstract={Summary form only given, as follows. The H1N1 pandemic of 2009 and the ongoing Ebola outbreak in West Africa serve as a reminder of the social, economic and health burden of infectious diseases. The ongoing trends towards urbanization, global travel, climate change and a generally older and immuno-compromised population continue to make epidemic planning and control challenging. Recent quantitative changes in high performance pervasive computing have created new opportunities for collecting, integrating, analyzing and accessing information related to large urban social systems, disease surveillance and global logistics and supply chains. The advances in network and information science that build on this new capability provide entirely new ways for reasoning and controlling epidemics. In this talk I will overview of the state of the art in computational networked epidemiology with an emphasis on computational thinking and on the development of high performance computing oriented decision-support environments for planning and response in the event of epidemics. I will describe how such systems can be used to support near real-time planning and response during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu and the recent Ebola Outbreak in West Africa. Computational challenges and directions for future research will be discussed.},

  abstract={In this era of large-scale data, distributed systems built on top of clusters of commodity hardware provide cheap and reliable storage and scalable processing of massive data. With cheap storage, instead of storing only currently relevant data, it is common to store as much data as possible, hoping that its value can be extracted later. In this way, exabytes (1018 bytes) of data are being created on a daily basis. Extracting value from these data, however, requires scalable implementations of advanced analytical algorithms beyond simple data processing, e.g., statistical regression methods, linear algebra, and optimization algorithms. Most such traditional methods are designed to minimize floating-point operations, which is the dominant cost of in-memory computation on a single machine. In parallel and distributed environments, however, load balancing and communication, including disk and network input/output (I/O), can easily dominate computation. These factors greatly increase the complexity of algorithm design and challenge traditional ways of thinking about the design of parallel and distributed algorithms. Here, we review recent work on developing and implementing randomized matrix algorithms in large-scale parallel and distributed environments. Randomized algorithms for matrix problems have received a great deal of attention in recent years, thus far typically either in theory or in machine learning applications or with implementations on a single machine.},

  abstract={With more emphasis on internet as a primary mechanism for information access and communication, it is highly important that the platform stays safe and secure for anyone who uses it. Online scams and cybercrimes are becoming a common threat to the technology and systems that help mitigate these issues are in high demand. Businesses all over the world invest heavily to stay secure in the cyberspace and rely on security experts in defending their business from online threats. The immense scale of the internet and the dynamicity of the threat it holds forces the adoption of automated threat detection systems. Several cybersecurity use cases exist, but the two use cases discussed here are DGA detection and Malicious URL detection. This paper addresses the drawbacks of previous rulebased and machine learning based detection methods. Here, embedding concepts from NLP is incorporated into cybersecurity use cases to propose a new in house model christened S.P.O.O.F Net, which is a combination of a Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory Network. The proposed model is benchmarked with machine learning algorithm incorporating bi-gram feature engineering techniques and also a conventional CNN with character level embedding (same as the one used for S.P.O.O.F Net). It was observed that S.P.O.O.F Net gave better performance over the aforementioned methods with accuracy scores of 98.3% for DGA detections and 99% for malicious URL detection. This work also aims to demonstrate the possibilities of incorporating NLP concepts to cybersecurity use cases and provide future researches a new thinking curve to develop systems in this domain.},

  abstract={Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have garnered significant interest in research on high-performance computing because their computation and communication capabilities have drastically improved in recent years due to advances in semiconductor integration technologies that rely on Moore's Law. In addition to improving FPGA performance, toolchains for the development of FPGAs in OpenCL have been developed and offered by FPGA vendors that reduce the programming effort required. These improvements reveal the possibility of implementing a concept to enable on-the-fly offloading computation at which CPUs/GPUs perform poorly to FPGAs while performing low-latency data movement. We think that this concept is key to improving the performance of heterogeneous supercomputers using accelerators such as the GPU. In this paper, we propose an OpenCL-enabled data movement method to directly access the global memory of the GPU and show how to implement cooperative GPU-FPGA computation using it. The results of experiments show that our proposed method can achieve a latency of 0.59 μs and a data transfer rate as high as 7.0 GB/s between the GPU and the FPGA, thus confirming that it is effective at realizing high-performance cooperative GPU-FPGA computation.},

  abstract={Identifying DNA N4-methylcytosine (4mC) sites is of great significance in biological research, such as chromatin structure, DNA stability, DNA–protein interaction, and controlling gene expression. However, the traditional sequencing technology to identify 4mC sites is very time-consuming. In order to detect 4mC sites, we develop a multiview learning method for achieving more effectively via merging multiple feature spaces. Furthermore, we think about whether the multiview learning method can improve the across species classification ability by fusing data of multiple species. In our study, we propose a multiview Laplacian kernel sparse representation-based classifier, called MvLapKSRC-HSIC. First, we make use of three feature extraction methods [position-specific trinucleotide propensity, nucleotide chemical property, and DNA physicochemical properties) to extract the DNA sequence features. MvLapKSRC-HSIC uses a kernel sparse representation-based classifier with graph regularization. In order to maintain the independence between various views, we add a multiview regularization term constructed by Hilbert–Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). In the experiments, MvLapKSRC-HSIC is applied on six datasets, so as to compare with other popular methods in single-species and cross-species experiments. All experimental results show that MvLapKSRC-HSIC is superior to other outstanding methods on both single species and cross species. Importantly, MvLapKSRC-HSIC can identify a series of potential DNA 4mC sites, which have not yet been experimentally evaluate on multiple species and merit further research.},

  abstract={Understanding the I/O characteristics of applications on supercomputers is crucial to paving the path for application optimization and system resource allocation. We collect and analyze I/O traces of applications on a production supercomputer and reconfirm that I/O bursts exist in most applications. What's more, we find that the I/O bursts not only occur in short periods of time but also originate from a minority of adjacent compute nodes allocated to the applications, which we call spatiotemporal I/O burstiness. The concentration of I/O traffic in both time and space dimension will make applications experience poor I/O performance and incur I/O inefficiency of the storage system. Although there are some solutions, such as burst buffer, can help alleviate such inefficiency, there is still no work that measures, analyzes and further predicts the application I/O characteristic in terms of spatiotemporal burstiness, which we think is vital for application-aware optimizations, including but not limited to burst buffer allocation and job scheduling. In this paper, we first propose a mathematical model to measure the spatiotemporal I/O burstiness. Then a thorough analysis on the spatiotemporal I/O characteristic of all applications on the system is elaborated. We further make use of the job's submitting path to explore the I/O characteristic similarity among jobs, based on which a machine learning classification algorithm is proposed to accurately predict the job spatiotemporal I/O burstiness in advance. With accurate job I/O characteristic at hand, some useful suggestions are put forward to hedge the impacts of the spatiotemporal I/O burstiness.},
