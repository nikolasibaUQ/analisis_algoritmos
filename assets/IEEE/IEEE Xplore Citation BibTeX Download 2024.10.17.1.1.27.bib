  abstract={We live in space time dimensions and all physical and social sciences are based on the dimensions. The representation and digitization of scientific phenomena into data and computation of the digitized data greatly depends on the spatiotemporal principles that govern the relationships of phenomena. The latest advancement of cloud computing is not an exception. Conducting cloud computing in a spatiotemporal fashion will help use spatiotemporal principles, which exist in all physical and social sciences, to optimize cloud computing and science discoveries. This paper 1) introduces the latest advancement of distributed computing; 2) analyzes the impact cloud computing has on GIS science, application, and education; 3) illustrates how spatiotemporal principles exist and can be utilized to enable cloud computing and science discoveries; and 4) discusses research directions and agenda for GIScience professionals in the 21st centuries.},

  abstract={Historians of scientific thought and philosophy have emphasized during the Enlightenment a shift from chance-based medieval thought to probability-based modern thought. They have not, however, focused on the technology that makes the implementation of such thought possible. At the same time, historians of computing have emphasized the rise of mechanical calculators—predecessors of modern computers—in this same period, but only in reference to solving practical problems arising from increasingly complex societies. This paper will draw on the two different streams of historical thought to show how the rise of probability and statistics and the rise of mechanical calculating devices were inextricably linked in complex ways.},

  year={2023},

  pages={481-486},
  abstract={Designing robots is a multiphase process aimed at solving a multi-criteria optimization problem to find the best possible detailed design. Generative design (GD) aims to accelerate the design process compared to manual design, since GD allows exploring and exploiting the vast design space more efficiently. In the field of robotics, however, relevant research focuses mostly on the generation of fully-actuated open chain kinematics, which is trivial in mechanical engineering perspective. Within this paper, we address the problem of generative design of closed-chain linkage mechanisms. A GD algorithm has to be able to generate meaningful mechanisms which satisfy conditions of existence. We propose an optimization-driven algorithm for generation of planar closed-chain linkages to follow a predefined trajectory. The algorithm creates an unlimited range of physically reproducible design alternatives that can be further tested in simulation. These tests could be done in order to find solutions that satisfy extra criteria, e.g., desired dynamic behavior or low energy consumption. The proposed algorithm is called “respawn” since it builds a new linkage after the ancestor has been tested in a virtual environment in pursuit for the optimal solution. To show that the algorithm is general enough, we show a set of generated linkages that can be used for a wide class of robots.},

  abstract={Nanoscale technologies have gone from being just an ambitious concept to being a rapidly advancing area of interdisciplinary science with immense practical importance. Feynman's vision on nanoscience provided great impetus to the development of nanophysics, nanochemistry, nanoelectronics and nanotechnology in general. High resolution microscopic devices such as scanning tunneling microscope, transmission electron microscope and atomic force microscope etc. in mid 1980s allowed researchers to see individual atoms on surfaces and arrange them. The authors (nanobiologists, computer scientists, biotechnologists and material scientists) attempt to provide a review of the state of the art in the field of nanoscale technologies and its impact on various fields of research like computation, basic biology, medicine and agricultural biotechnology. Imprints of memory mechanisms in living systems operating at different levels (e.g. biochemical, immunological and neuronal) have provided inputs to design and fabricate 'bio-inspired' nanoelectronic devices suitable for various applications. Several examples of such nanoscale technology based frameworks and devices are presented in the scenario of their potential role in the development of future nanoscale technologies. Nanoscale technologies might finally revolutionize computational intelligence and thinking. The power and limits of computing processes govern the intelligence, knowledge acquisition and thinking process of human and machine. Present computational methods and models provide us courage to study the problem, but these tools are not yet sufficient to answer the following riddles of machine intelligence - what can computers do better than humans? What can humans do better than computers? And the most important one - what is computable? The authors try to present evidences that show bio-inspired nanoscale technologies might gain the power in helping us to go deeper into these challenges of research in future},

  abstract={Recently, Japan (also world-wide countries) has become aged society, and a wide variety welfare device and system have been developed. But evaluation of welfare system and device are limited only stability, intensity and partial operability. Thus, evaluation of usefulness is insufficient. Evaluation of usefulness is necessity to consider about interaction of human and welfare device. In this paper, we measure load of sitting and standing movement to use EMG (Electromyogram) and 3D Motion Capture and set a goal to establish objective evaluation method. We think that establishing objective evaluation method is necessity to develop useful welfare device. We examined possibility of assessing load and fatigue from measuring brain activity to use NIRS (Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy). We think that measuring load and fatigue is very important for developing user-friendly welfare device. Idea of universal design is widespread in welfare device and system. Measuring require verification of all generations. However, we performed to measure younger subjects as a first step. We think that younger subjects were observed the significant difference, because they had enough physical function. Considering younger subjects as a benchmark is appropriate for creating evaluation method.},

  abstract={Technology has become an essential part of our everyday life, and its use in educational environments keeps growing. In addition, games are one of the most popular activities across cultures and ages, and there is ample evidence that supports the benefits of using games for assessment. This field is commonly known as game-based assessment (GBA), which refers to the use of games to assess learners' competencies, skills, or knowledge. In this article, we analyze the current status of the GBA field by performing the first systematic literature review on empirical GBA studies. It is based on 65 research papers that used digital GBAs to determine: the context where the study has been applied, the primary purpose, the domain of the game used, game/tool availability, the size of the data sample, the computational methods and algorithms applied, the targeted stakeholders of the study, and what limitations and challenges are reported by authors. Based on the categories established and our analysis, the findings suggest that GBAs are mainly used in K-16 education and for assessment purposes, and that most GBAs focus on assessing STEM content, and cognitive and soft skills. Furthermore, the current limitations indicate that future GBA research would benefit from the use of bigger data samples and more specialized algorithms. Based on our results, we discuss current trends in the field and open challenges (including replication and validation problems), providing recommendations for the future research agenda of the GBA field.},

  abstract={While many initiatives have broadened participation of minoritized youth in K-12 computing education, far fewer efforts have focused on expanding the social, political and cultural contexts of CS identity development. In this study, we propose a “restorying” pedagogy which engaged high school youth in interrogating dominant narratives about computer science through collaborative, electronic textile quilt-making. In our social design experiment approach, we designed and implemented a workshop where 14 racially- and ethnically-diverse youth crafted and coded interactive quilt patches that were digitally “stitched” into a collaborative artifact, with each patch reimagining CS from youths' perspectives (particularly regarding what CS is, who can participate in CS, and how CS is done). By analyzing post-workshop interviews and participant artifacts, we observed that counterstorytelling through electronic quilting can act as accessible and authentic tools to support youth's political identity work, electronic counternarrative expression, and community building in computing education. In the discussion, we address how restorying can contribute towards developing self-authored identities and critical computational literacies among youth and educators, as well as political solidarity within CS learning environments.},

  abstract={The rapid growth of the manufacturing, automotive, robotics, and smart-grid industries will require engineers that posses attributes related to multidisciplinary formation and strong tools to design solutions to complex problems. The engineer's formation requires to include the development of multidisciplinary abilities into their programs and backing the theory with real-world practice. In this sense, specialized laboratories are necessary in order to carry out this kind of formation and training. However, the lack of specialized laboratories is one of the main obstacles preventing us from reaching this objective. The specialized laboratories require specialized installation, maintenance and cost management as well as a design that can accommodate a large number of students. In contrast, the virtual laboratories are one tool that can be used to deal with both issues which are the lack of specialized engineers and the absence of specialized laboratories. This work proposes a new design of a virtual laboratory in order to specialize engineers in several fields such as power electronics, electric machines, automatic control, and information and computational technologies. The laboratory proposed includes tools such as co-simulation, co-modeling, and co-design in order to face complex problems within the industry.},

  pages={18307-18317},
  abstract={Deep-learning based computer vision models have proved themselves to be ground-breaking approaches to human activity recognition (HAR). However, most existing works are dedicated to improve the prediction accuracy through either creating new model architectures, increasing model complexity, or refining model parameters by training on larger datasets. Here, we propose an alternative idea, differing from existing work, to increase model accuracy and also to shape model predictions to align with human understandings through automatically creating higher-level summarizing labels for similar groups of human activities. First, we argue the importance and feasibility of constructing a hierarchical labeling system for human activity recognition. Then, we utilize the predictions of a black box HAR model to identify similarities between different activities. Finally, we tailor hierarchical clustering methods to automatically generate hierarchical trees of activities and conduct experiments. In this system, the activity labels on the same level will have a designed magnitude of accuracy and reflect a specific amount of activity details. This strategy enables a trade-off between the extent of the details in the recognized activity and the user privacy by masking some sensitive predictions; and also provides possibilities for the use of formerly prohibited invasive models in privacy-concerned scenarios. Since the hierarchy is generated from the machine's perspective, the predictions at the upper levels provide better accuracy, which is especially useful when there are too detailed labels in the training set that are rather trivial to the final prediction goal. Moreover, the analysis of the structure of these trees can reveal the biases in the prediction model and guide future data collection strategies.},

On the basis of the exploration of the potentials if designing a teaching mode with the Scratch Graphical Programming Language, this paper builds a situational teaching mode of programming in high school with Scratch. This teaching mode first design a programming learning situation which is familiar by students because of its close connection to the students' daily life with Scratch for student through the analysis of the common elements between the situation and the concept of programming. The n guide students learning in the situation, and transfer back to the traditional programming environmental after he understand the content of concept. This teaching mode can arouse the students' interests of learning; promote the students' learning transfer ability. Ultimately this teaching mode can help students better understand algorithm programming and established their Computational thinking. Both of them play a significant positive role in developing students' logical thinking ability and their ability in solving practical problem.},

  abstract={The Ministry of Information Technology, Information and Communication, under the aegis of the Mauritian government aims at developing digital learning to improve the potential of Mauritian students for the future. As the country posits itself as a cyber-island with a fully developed information technology hub, it has become imperative to think about leveraging the teaching of computer science in lower secondary schools (Grades 7-9). So far, this has been limited to basic courses in computing that are essentially theory focused. This paper states that students at this stated level need to develop `computational thinking' so that they are ready for the workplace and will effectively enter the digital world. It limits itself to two key variables resource leveraging and teaching computing. In the first case, it raises arguments on programming languages, hardware and software that might apply to students in the new curriculum. In the teaching area, the paper suggests that a combination of teaching programming, inclusion and informal learning will be the possibilities to accompany students overcome the digital divide and get the opportunity to become effective as learners and trained ICT students to serve their nation.},

This preliminary data focus on a feasibility implementation of an assessment designed to embed these standards. Three elementary level classroom teachers and their students used the process and demonstrated that (1) teachers can learn to design and use this process and (2) their students demonstrate elements of computational thinking that not only includes the Common Core standards but extends them.},

  abstract={Mathematics teachers want to enable students to understand mathematical objects clearly and want to use their original class materials with accurate and impressive figures. To do so, it is suitable to use both TeX and Computer Algebra System (CAS). Nevertheless, the graphic output of CAS is not suited to the TeX document of the material. To improve it, since 2006, the authors have been developing KETpic as a plug-in based on CAS. The use of both TeX and KETpic based on CAS enables teachers to produce their original class materials with accurate and impressive figures. They wish not only to produce their original class materials with figures but also to use the class materials with figures produced by the others. To realize that objective, a good KETpic programming style is needed. For example, when educators produce a figure along with their material by KETpic, they wish to perform symbolic thinking, i.e. they create a KETpic program in a mathematical drawing procedure and concentrate their energy on qualitative improvement of the figures while they recognize the global image of the figure. Symbolic thinking is a factor in good elements of KETpic programming style. The authors investigated other good elements of KETpic programming style using a documentation approach, which is the method of checking teachers' records in detail for their improvement. In this paper, the authors present four good elements of the KETpic programming style.},

  year={2018},
  volume={36},
  number={14},
  pages={2955-2965},
  abstract={This paper proposes a novel carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimator for the coherent optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (CO-OFDM) systems using the matched-filter (MF) concept. We consider an OFDM symbol with N subcarriers so that the receiver takes N time samples of the received noisy CO-OFDM signal. Our idea is to first append these N received samples with (L - 1)N zeros at the end to get a sequence of LN time samples. By taking the discrete Fourier transform of these LN samples, we compute the spectrum of the CO-OFDM symbol at LN discrete frequency points. We think of this spectrum as being made up of L sets of N points each, each set consisting of the frequency points {2π/LN l, 2π/LN l + 2π/N , . . . , 2π/LN l + 2π(N -1)/N}, for each value of l, where l = 0, 1, . . . , L - 1. Each set of N points for one value of l can be considered as the spectrum of the CO-OFDM symbol corresponding to one hypothesized value 2π/LN l of the CFO. The receiver can now obtain the maximum likelihood (ML) CFO estimate by determining the hypothesized value that best matches the spectrum of the CO-OFDM symbol received from the channel. In the case of data-aided (DA) ML estimation, we treat the OFDM symbol as a pilot symbol in which we know the data in all the subcarriers, and this pilot symbol is used as the reference signal for the MF. In the case of blind (BL) ML estimation, the data in all the subcarriers are unknown, and the receiver uses an OFDM symbol with no data modulation in all the subcarriers as the reference signal. After making the ML decision of the hypothesized value of the CFO, a fine search will be carried out to determine the actual value more accurately. It turns out only one step is necessary to locate the actual value of the CFO. The DA MF ML algorithm can achieve full-range (integral and fractional part) CFO estimation with high accuracy, while the BL MF ML algorithm has low computational complexity but focuses on the fractional CFO estimation only. We discuss the complexity and performance of this MF ML algorithm, and present simulation results to demonstrate the estimation error variance for 16-PSK/QAM modulations. The simulation results show that the estimation error variance of the DA MF ML algorithm can achieve the Cramer-Rao lower bound in the absence of the laser phase noise.},

  abstract={Physical space appeared with the birth of the earth. With the emergence of social space, thinking space, and cyberspace (STCs), things in physical space are continuously enriched. Consequently, the PhiNet, an abstracted network concept such as relationships between things, is becoming more complex. Physical space plays a fundamental role in promoting the connection and development with the other three spaces. We think that PhiNet of Things (PoT) is a unified description of pure physical space and the evolving physical space affected by STCs. While the Internet of Things (IoT) is described from a cyber view, in this article, the definition of PoT is put forward from a natural view. Besides, the evolution of PoT is identified by the time sequence in which the four spaces appeared. At each stage, research is carried out from two perspectives of things and PhiNet, and two specific examples are presented to illustrate the change process of things and the related PhiNet. In addition, two applications are listed to explain the usability of PoT in the current development stage. Finally, the article gives the possible future development direction of PoT. The purpose of this article is to illustrate the fundamental role of physical space in the continuous development through time sequence.},

  title={Genetic Algorithm Optimization of Teams for Heterogeneity}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This work in progress study aims at developing a system to designate teams to relatively large groups of students in a classroom setting. It is motivated by recent changes in the ABET Criterion 3 accreditation guideline that requires students to demonstrate "an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives." Outside of accreditation guidelines, team-based learning is becoming the prescribed pedagogical tool to enhance student collaboration and prepare them for professional work environments upon graduation. One important factor in effective team-based learning is to ensure teams are balanced in their abilities and characteristics across team members. Demographical memberships of students can also play an important role in team dynamics and impact the overall success in content learning. Instructors usually assign teams to students by manually looking into their abilities from previous grades and other performance factors. This can then become tedious when aiming to maintain uniform heterogeneity in classrooms of students coming from diverse backgrounds of knowledge, skills, ethnicity, and gender. While some studies have presented the use of computer-aided tools, visualization categorization, and other Artificial Intelligence techniques, this work proposes the use of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to form teams optimized for heterogeneity. The Genetic Algorithm presented uses a discrete integer-based chromosome representation and groups alleles to represent each team. Standard GA operators enable the algorithm to be adapted to any optimizing criteria deemed fit by the instructor. The algorithm presented in this work uses self-reported competency data on 3 different computational skills for 1300 students enrolled in a firstyear engineering design thinking course divided into over 20course sections of strength 40-60 each. Net team scores for each computational tool are calculated and the variation across each skill minimized by the fitness function for individual sections. Constraints based on gender and ethnicity are applied to minimize demographical imbalance between teams. The algorithm is tested for all sections in the Fall 2019 cohort to give consistent team configuration. Discussions on the stability and validity of configurations generated are discussed. Future work include methods that use a fuzzy logic decision-making tool for multiple criteria optimization.},

  abstract={This paper summarizes an event which brought together modeling experts, users, potential users and healthcare management practitioners to explore the question of evidence in the field of healthcare: how it is, and how it should be, used. The paper is an abridged version of a full report on the event. The paper highlights the high status accorded to empirical evidence (generated, in particular by randomized controlled trials), and suggests that a more balanced view of evidence, as being composed of empiricist, rationalist, and historicist material, is of value. Modeling and simulation constitute sources of rationalist evidence. Tensions between different types of evidence are identified, and the tension between statistics and stories as evidential forms is explored. The paper concludes on an optimistic note: there are clear signs that within the UK National Health Service, modeling and simulation are being taken more seriously as sources of evidence.},

  abstract={We describe trial applications of fuzzy sets to data retrieval. The objectives are to test their ability to achieve conceptual matching between retrieved objects and the user's intention and to connect real data with symbolic notations. The algorithm proposed retrieves data that conceptually fit the meanings of the entered keyword. An algorithm is described that uses fuzzy sets to handle word ambiguity (the main cause of vagueness in the meaning of a word). It is based on conceptual fuzzy sets (CFSs), which represent the meaning of words by chaining other related words. Two trial applications of this algorithm to data retrieval are described. First, an application to image retrieval shows variation of data retrieval with conceptual matching and transformation of numeric values into symbols. Next, an application to the agent recommending a TV program shows the method that lets CFSs fit to the sense of a user by Hebbian learning.},

  abstract={It is one of a teacher's challenges in lesson planning to consider all levels of learning involving students' team skills while taking the actual subject content into account. This descriptive study examines how the student-centered approach can be utilized as supportive classroom climate and how it can be combined with cooperative team tasks for solving computational thinking problems using an easy accessible computer-coding environment. Drawing on existing concepts and research methods this study applies a case study approach with mixed methods to investigate students' development of team-attitudes and characteristics of team cooperation. It turned out, that students identified the quality of cooperation in their teams as beneficial and productive while from an outside point of view their teamwork seemed to be unorganized and not cooperative. These contradicting results were clarified in a classroom meeting, where it became clear, that the student-centered classroom climate still could have influenced students' team attitudes in a way that students felt comfortable to express themselves in their, sometimes not so nice, youth language during problem solving tasks but while be able to solve problems effectively.},

  abstract={Full paper, Research-to-Practice. With the nation's continuing shortage of scientists and engineers, there is an urgent need for diverse students, especially Hispanic students, to enter and complete science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education at all levels. Contributing factors to the low representation in STEM areas are the lack of Hispanic youth's exposure to engaging and relevant experiences with science in their early stages of development and the lack of Latino scientists as role models that are visible, tangible, real, and inspiring to their communities. In addition, student experiences in math and science in the middle grades have emerged as a “filter” that prevents many students from pursuing advanced STEM courses in high school and, therefore, limits their knowledge of and interest in exploring STEM subjects and careers later in their education. This paper presents a research-based approach to attract middle school students to STEM fields in a majority Hispanic region, using a game-based learning platform. The platform integrates computational thinking in the area of water conservation at middle-school level by using simulations and data visualization in concurrent learning modules. The concepts introduced in the platform are universal enough to be successfully employed in other geographical regions with different student demographics.},

  abstract={Japan's elementary school educators are facing the difficult task of teaching computer programming education and computational thinking in a playful way which affords students' time to acquire new knowledge while discovering new technology. Japan as a nation has constantly ranked lower than other developed nations in the field of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) literacy. The recent introduction of programming education has created an additional task for educators to learn about programming in order to teach it. Programming education was introduced in April 2020, and little research has been done to measure the knowledge gap of educators. In March 2020, a month before the implementation of programming instruction in Japanese schools, 22 elementary schools were visited to access readiness and to distribute an online survey. The surveys and informal interviews revealed the unpreparedness of educators for the task of teaching programming and limited programming material in the approved textbooks. This research is intended to inform stakeholders in order to improve the fundamental training of in-service and pre-service educators so they can have the necessary knowledge and confidence to teach programming in a fun and playful manner to their students.},

  abstract={While governments, teacher educators, and teachers recognize the importance of introducing computer science (CS) in K-12, there is limited understanding about when the teacher preparation should start and how it needs to be done. Furthermore, with the rapid expansion of digital technology in our society and the way it affects our lives, new educational frameworks for better teacher preparation have been developed, such as TPACK and CTIntegration, that situate new technologies and their role in education to meet the new societal demands. There is a larger body of research in Mathematics on how on how to prepare teachers to teach than in CS. This study explores how graduate teaching candidates and undergraduate pre-service teachers engage with Math+CS modules differently. We were interested in the similarities and differences in the way senior-level pre-service teachers in a mathematics and technology class and graduate-level teacher candidates in a methods class interact with Math+CS integrated modules. Working with the concepts of variable, input, and output, we investigated which knowledge domains were leveraged among groups in different classes, what connections they make between the concepts in math and CS, and their uncertainty. The results indicated that there was a difference in the way the teaching candidates in their methods class approached the computational modules than the pre-service teachers. The pre-service teachers focused more on developing their CS content knowledge, and the teacher candidates were interested in making connections between their knowledge domains, reflecting on how their students would think about the concepts in math, expressing more concerns, and asking more questions to develop their TPACK.},

  abstract={Computer science education in primary and secondary schools uses the. visual programming language "Scratch " to learn computational thinking. However, the limited number of course hours and overwhelmed teachers delay students’ learning progression. Although many Scratch instructional videos are available online, students still fail because of a lack of keyword-searching ability. Given this learning dilemma, we use the existing teaching videos online as hints assisting students in learning "Scratch." This project uses OpenCV to record the program blocks and analyze the behavioral intentions, and then compares and analyzes it with the video content to recommend and mark relevant segments that students need. We believe that through this recommendation system, intelligent hints in the form of videos can cultivate students’ self-learning ability and improve current teaching adversity.},
