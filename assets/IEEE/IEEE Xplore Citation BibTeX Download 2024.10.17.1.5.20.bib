  abstract={System Theories, analysis and design have been deployed within every corporate function and within a broad section of businesses and markets. Systems thinking involve changing paradigms about the way the world works, the way corporations function, and the human role in each. In systems thinking, analysis and design we look for interrelationships among the elements of a system. System engineering technology involves the interactions of science, an organization, and its environment as well as the information and knowledge bases that support each. The purpose of systems engineering is to support organizations that desire improved performance. Software Process Simulation is directly linked to software process improvement. Organizations can use software process simulation at all levels of maturity to obtain significant benefits. The aim is to determine how to usefully model a teaching-learning system for a specific course taught to a fresh graduate, and use simulation and modeling to predict consequences of changes to the process.},

  abstract={System thinking refers to the interrelationship between the parts of the organization that intend to design, produce and distribute products or services. System thinking is actually a conceptual language that encourages professionals into using “feedback loop" thinking rather than mere linear thinking. To solve a problem, systems thinking requires the building of a model by a diverse group with a varied input. The group modeling process which is an important process of system dynamics intervention in organizations is mainly developed by researchers from similar backgrounds and cultures. A research conducted in Israel, a country with a mixture of cultures and social backgrounds, evokes a different experience and approach to the more known group model building techniques. Since the participants in the group were from diverse backgrounds in terms of their culture, economic situation and their work position, they could easily be led by their social condition in their thinking and opinions. Therefore, knowledge elicitation through the group model building process during the group sessions and on the other hand, knowledge elicitation through personal conversation brought up contradictory information and called for constantly improving the elicitation process.},

  abstract={With the prime objective of understanding the direction in which the field of big data is heading, this paper emphasizes on the recent and upcoming trends in big data. The human brain handles big data in all its forms very efficiently and almost instantaneously, no matter what is the granularity of the data. The idea behind the field of processing big data is to mimic the manner in which the natural brain works and handles big data. All the fields and subfields of machine intelligence are based on identifying and mimicking the natural methods which are used by mother nature to handle big data. The current trends are mainly moving towards processing big data using the cloud infrastructure and machine learning techniques. By and large the intention of artificial intelligence lies in developing a humanoid robot which can work, talk and think like a human being. The future trends of big data are being applied to such techniques as microprocessors processing big data in a robot’s-brain to plan its actions, express emotions and ultimately to think like a human being.},

  abstract={Implementing the human way of thinking in different systems is still an open issue in artificial intelligence. Part of this thinking is also the so-called associative reasoning, which is based on associations arising mainly from the simultaneous observations of individual concepts representing our world. These observations can take both the form of images and simultaneous perceptions through other human senses (e.g., sound perceptions). This paper focuses on how to represent these perceptions and their sequence and ways to implement associative reasoning based on them. A data model enabling this functionality on large volumes of data will be presented, as well as the results of experiments on it.},

  abstract={The last few decades proves to be an era of booming communication and information disciplines, bringing about profound influence on people's life and every socio-economic sector. In this dramatically changed world, it is being found that many of the systems engineering principles and business practices that some industries have purposely pursued no longer function effectively in a System of Systems environment. This paper is inspired by the embedded, “system of systems (SoS) thinking” in the context of military programming. The purpose of this paper is to draw a conceptual framework for a smart tourism industry information system in responding to competitive challenges. The approach here is to illustrate how this SoS thinking and corresponding SoS engineering (SoSE) may be applied through the top-level design for the smart system. For designing a policy maker-responsive, informative system, an emerging complex spatial information approach, geographical simulation, is introduced. This holistic means includes: 1) simulation of the tourism SoS' architecture and evolution process through cellular automata (CA) and multi-agent systems (MAS) techniques, based on remote sensing data and GIS instrument; 2) illustration of the mechanism of industrial evolution by scale-free network analysis and social influence network with dynamic Bayesian network theory. This paper calls for a particular attention of communication specialists to concern the forefront of information (esp. spatial information) and systems engineering disciplines.},

  abstract={People are anxious about the potential dangers of scuba diving and like in all sports, there are dangers involved in it. Typically, people think sharks and shark attacks are the dangers of scuba diving, as sharks are one of the ocean's biggest predators, and the great white shark, in particular, is one of the primary threats to divers. The study proposes a deep learning approach to shark detection for underwater diving surveillance. A large collection of great white sharks' datasets underwater is used by the system for training as sharks are hard to differentiate from other sharks like animals in an underwater environment. A YOLOv3 algorithm that uses convolutional neural networks for object detection, multiscale prediction, and bounding box prediction through the use of logistic regression is used in the study. And with this approach, the testing of the shark detection system generates a good result.},

  abstract={The essence of fuzzy control is to build a model of human expert who is capable of controlling the plant without thinking in terms of mathematical model. The transformation of expert's knowledge in terms of control rules to fuzzy framework has not been formalized and arbitrary choices concerning, for example, the shape of membership functions have to be made. The quality of fuzzy controller can be drastically affected by the choice of membership functions. Thus, methods for tuning the fuzzy logic controllers are needed. In this paper, neural networks are used in a novel way to solve the problem of tuning a fuzzy logic controller. The neuro-fuzzy controller uses the neural network learning techniques to tune the membership functions while keeping the semantics of the fuzzy logic controller intact. Both the architecture and the learning algorithm are presented for a general neuro-fuzzy controller. From this general neuro-fuzzy controller, a proportional neuro-fuzzy controllers is derived. A step by step algorithm for off-line training is given along with numerical examples.},

The control logic plays vital role in an agile manufacturing system for proper functioning of the FMS. The effort to integrate the formal verification techniques with virtual commissioning is emerging, which is still not in a full fledged industrial usage, due to the isolated thinking of the user about formal verification techniques. Existing techniques like simulation has not been able to detect the hidden errors, which may propagate from one workcell to another workcell in a long run and create a complete breakdown in the manufacturing unit. These errors required to be carefully tested before the real time implementation. Control logics play a vital role to reduce the down-time and ramp-up time in a manufacturing industry. We need an integrated approach and techniques to support the consistent running of the production cycle. This paper explained about the positive aspects of manual and software based automated and virtual commissioning techniques to provide an applicable solution to the fast paced manufacturing industries.},

  abstract={The authors show a relationship between artificial potential field (APF) based motion planning/navigation and constrained optimization. They then present a simple genetic hill-climbing algorithm (SGHC) which is used to navigate a point robot through an environment using the APF approach. The motivation for the research is a robot that they are currently developing, named AGIE-3 (Autonomous Guided Intelligent Equipment 3), which senses and navigates through the use of a stereo vision head. They compare the SGHC with steepest descent hill-climbing (SDHC), using two environments. The first environment is composed of stationary obstacles while the second environment is composed of non-stationary obstacles. In SDHC, candidate moves are evaluated within a 360 degree radius and the best candidate is selected by the robot. One would think that the SGHC would be at a disadvantage; however, the performance of the SGHC is comparable with SDHC even though it does not search 360 degrees for candidate moves. The SGHC has an advantage in that it is capable of evolving the appropriate step size as well as the appropriate angle of movement.},

First, the principle of curvature measurement based upon fiber Bragg grating sensor was introduced, and the design of the layout of sensor's locations was optimized by the finite element (FE) analysis of the experimental model. Then, the algorithm description of surface reconstruction was given in detail. Finally, an experiment setup was built using an epoxy resin trapezoid plate equipped with distributed FBG sensors, combined with a data acquisition and a shape reconstruction algorithm system. Afterwards, the experiments of steady deformation and dynamic vibration behavior were implemented for the real-time shape reconstruction of wing model structure. The results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the presented method of deformation shape detection for a sort of wing model structure based on fiber Bragg grating sensor array, and indicate that the proposed method can provide useful research thinking for the further study of active monitoring for aerospace wing structures.},

  abstract={The events of recent years have shed new light on the crisis and change management practices of economic actors. It has been a truism that actors who are more receptive to change can be more successful and efficient than their peers in business markets. Perhaps the most significant changes in recent years have confirmed this even more. One only has to think of the impact of pandemic COVID-19, the energy crisis or the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. In a very short period of time, these events have brought about very significant changes and their impact has been largely negative for most economic actors. If it has not been sufficiently understood so far why it can be important to adapt to changes in a timely and appropriate way, or why good crisis management practices can be important, perhaps everyone will now. Meanwhile, other trends are shaping the global economy and will have an impact on the future state of the economy and society. Examples include sustainability (or the green transition) and digitalisation. Two global changes that will certainly have a long-term impact on society and business processes. No one can afford the luxury of ignoring these changes. What is more, the most competitive economic players are seeking to turn them to their advantage and to reap the benefits of sustainability or digitalisation. It is clear that our world has become faster and more complex than ever before. More and more things are changing around us, with ever more intense consequences. We need to recognise in time how we can respond to changing environmental conditions or circumstances. This is the subject of the present paper, which, after a brief literature review, draws on research findings to illustrate the importance and relevance of digitalisation.},

  abstract={Universities are institutions that educate and generate labor candidates; as a result, the process of selecting new university students should pay attention to several matters and these matters should be considered. Many universities in the process base the selection on the academic skills and consequently problems will appear when an individual should evaluate all the job criteria as he or she enters employment. Through this paper the researchers would like to propose a model, AHP-TOPSIS, for the process of selecting new university students and for predicting their future employment. With the sample of 30 students from Diploma 3 Aeronautics STTA Yogyakarta, an evaluation model was designed using the indicators of academic skills, English proficiency skills, psycho test, soft skills (communication, problem solving and critical thinking, time management, cooperation, and adaptation skills), and attitudes. The load for these indicators were attained using the AHP and then these indicators would be calculated using the TOPSIS in order to find the alternative rank of the students' selection. The rank was determined by gathering the interest score from the calculation using the AHP so that the integrated evaluation results could be provided. The main objective of this paper was assisting the decision-makers in the process of selecting new university students who have both academic and personality skills that would be necessary to support their performance in the future employment.},

  abstract={In this work, we are integrating thermal aware design approach in energy efficient Vedic multiplier on FPGA. In the beginning of this universe, Veda describes heat receiving from the Sun god as Suryamrit (Surya i.e. Sun +Amrit i.e. Nectar= Suryamrit i.e. Nectar coming from the Sun God). Now, whole world is feeling anxious about temperature. How our thinking pattern is changing with evolution of mankind? This paper deals with that question and the whole work is going in direction to get solution of this problem with mechanism of ambient (room) temperature scaling and energy efficient LVCMOS I/O standard. LVCMOS is an acronym for low voltage complementary metal oxide semiconductor. In this Vedic multiplier, we are using three LVCMOS I/O standard. LVCMOS12 is available only in 65nm and 40nm FPGA. Rest LVCMOS18 and LVCMOS25 is available among 40nm, 65nm and 90nm FPGA. In order to test the thermal sustainability of our Vedic multiplier, we are testing it in three different room temperature 20°C, 30°C, and 40°C. Using LVCMOS25, there is 12.99%, 19.23% and 10.28% reduction in power dissipation on 90nm, 65nm and 40nm respectively. For LVCMOS25, when our Vedic multiplier design is migrated from 40nm design to 90nm design, there is 87.72% reduction in power dissipation of Vedic multiplier when temperature is constant 20°C.},

  abstract={In this research, Wireless EEG equipment via Bluetooth technology named g-Mobilab was used to measure the brainwave signals in the right and left frontal area of the brain. The recorded EEG signals were channelled into an automatic artifact removal analysis whereby signals above values of 100 micro-volts were removed by means of a program using Matlab. Consequently, Power Spectral Density techniques and specific algorithm were employed to further enhance the EEG signals. The correlation between the left and the right brainwaves were achieved using paired T test from SPSS. The results, which are brainwave balancing index (BBI) and brainwave dominance, were presented via Graphic User Interface (GUI). The outcome shows that BBI system could be established using EEG signals. These findings (brainwave dominance and BBI) could be used as a straightforward indicator of one's ability to think and work leading to vast opportunity for constructive human potential advancement.},

  abstract={ICT readiness is not an issue any more-or so we think. In the 21st century, when the industry and society are infused with IT one would reason the more the better, because there cannot possibly be anyone to detest, or stand up against automatization and IT. However, it is not so. Not only the elderly people, who were born before the 2nd world war, but even GenZ people can be afraid of the speed and scope of ICT and modern technology taking over territories of their lives [1]. Of course, there is a substantial part of people who are eagerly looking forward the future fully automatized, and there are others, who simply don't care. But there is a significant group of people, who are not prepared for automatization, who simply do not trust robots and autonomous systems in their lives. Present paper endeavours to approach the notion of ICT readiness from the social, psychological point of view, utilising the framework of the principal-agent theory.},

  pages={675-679},
  abstract={In this paper, a modified method for landslide prediction is presented. This method is based on the back propagation neural network(BPNN), and we use the combination of genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm to optimize the weights and biases of the network. The improved BPNN modeling can work out the complex nonlinear relation by learning model and using the present data. This paper demonstrates that the revised BPNN modeling can be used to predict and calculate landslide deformation, quicken the learning speed of network and improve the predicting precision. Applying this thinking and method into research of some landslide in the Three Gorges reservoir, the validity and practical value of this model can be demonstrated. And it also shows that the dynamic prediction of landslide deformation is very crucial.},

  abstract={Recently, a novel form of web services had seen the light under the name of Cloud Computing which presents the dematerialisation of software, systems and infrastructures. However, in a world where digital information is everywhere, finding the desired information has become a crucial problem. In other hand, the users of cloud services starting asking about their privacy protection, particularly when they lose control of their data during the treatment and even some of them think about counting the service providers themselves as honest attackers. For that, new approaches had been published in every axis of the privacy preserving domain. One of these axis consists of a special retrieval models which allow both finding and hiding sensitive desired information at the same time. The substance of our work is a new system of private information retrieval protocol (PIR) composed of four steps the authentication to ensure the identification of authorised users. The encryption of stored documents by the server using the boosting algorithm based on the life of bees and multi-filter cryptosystems. The information retrieval step using a combination of distances by social bees where a document must pass through three dams controlled with three types of worker bees, the bee queen represents the query and the hive represents the class of relevant documents. Finally, a visualization step that permits the presentation of the results in graphical format understandable by humans as a 3D cube. Our objectives is to amend the response to users' demands.},

  abstract={Railways provide the cheapest and most convenient mode of passenger transport both for long distance and suburban traffic. Also, most of transport in India is being carried out by railway network. Still accidents are the major concern in terms of railway track crossing and unidentified crack in rail tracks in Indian railway. About 60% accidents are occurring at railway track crossing and due to crack in railway tracks resulting in loss of precious life and loss of economy. Therefore there is need to think about new technology which is robust, efficient and stable for both automatic gate closure system and crack detection in railway track. This paper proposes an unmanned gate crossing and faulty rail track detection. Unmanned level crossing is a IR sensors base system and crack detection is an dynamic approach which combines the use of GPS (global positioning system) tracking system and GSM (global system for mobile communication) modem to send geographical coordinate of location. Unmanned gate crossing controller system prevents accident which are caused due to railway track crossing and railway crack detection system prevents train derailment by detecting crack in railway track using internet of things technology.},

  abstract={This article illustrates a simulation method to find a sizing and economic of a required photovoltaic array for a photovoltaic building in Malaysia. This paper represents the result using by Matlab software and also mathematic equation. It is known that the important factor for photovoltaic system is cost of a system, and because of several kinds of the photovoltaic array we have the right to select the best array with the best efficiency and best price. The popular types of materials are crystalline and thin films, which have differences in terms of light absorption efficiency, energy conversion efficiency, manufacturing technology and cost of production. Different kinds of crystalline materials like a mono-crystalline, polycrystalline are available. In this paper, the generated current and generated power by the photovoltaic array is calculated according to daily solar irradiation when the case study is Malaysia. Think over generated power of each array's and also according to required energy for a typically building, the number of photovoltaic array is estimated then the cost of the solar array is calculated. System is simulated by Matlab software, and the results are discussed. The simulation is about sizing and economic in order to select the best array for photovoltaic system to have a optimize system according to size and price of the system.},
