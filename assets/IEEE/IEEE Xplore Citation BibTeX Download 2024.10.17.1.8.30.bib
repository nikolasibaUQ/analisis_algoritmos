  abstract={Why would you need a security clearance to work? The answer is that, depending on where you want to work and the kind of work you want to do, you may, in fact, need one. Even a low-level, non-academic position at it university may require a security clearance if the work being done is defense related. Out in the "real world", the need to have a clearance is much more commonplace. This is because much government-funded research is dictated by military requirements. Therefore, it is a good idea to think about the potential impact on your job prospects of needing to qualify for a clearance as well as the effect of doing work that is classified on your career development. The paper discusses these two issues.},

  abstract={Scalability is a fundamental problem in the development of computer games and massively multiplayer online games (MMOs). Players always demand more - more polygons, more physics particles, more interesting AI behavior, more monsters, more simultaneous players and interactions, and larger virtual worlds. Scalability has long been a focus of the database research community. However, the games community has done little to exploit database research. Most game developers think of databases as persistence solutions, designed to store and read game state. But the advantages of database systems go way beyond persistence. Database research has dealt with the beautiful question of efficiently processing declarative languages, and the resulting research questions have touched many areas of computer science. In this talk, I will show how the idea of declarative processing from databases can be applied to computer games and simulations. I will describe our journey from declarative to imperative scripting languages for computer games and simulations, introducing the state-effect pattern, a design pattern that enables developers to design games and simulations that can be programmed imperatively, but processed declaratively. I will then show how we can use database techniques to run scalable games and simulations cheaply in the cloud. I will then discuss how we can use ideas from optimistic concurrency control to scale interactions between players in MMOs, and I will describe how we can use these techniques to build elastic transaction processing infrastructure for the cloud.},

  abstract={We reason about a wide variety of continuous properties. Weight, level, pressure, heat, and temperature are examples of physical quantities. One-dimensional versions of position, force, acceleration, and velocity are also quantities. More abstractly, prices, quality, stability, difficulty, and simplicity are properties that we often think of as more or less continuous. For some quantities, like weight, instruments can measure reasonably accurate numerical values, calibrated upon some well-agreed-on cultural standard. For others, like depth of friendship, it is far from clear that any specific number can be easily measured, although we can often ascertain that we are closer to one person than another.},

  abstract={The main concept of the multilayer client-server queuing network model method is called the basic model. This basic model can be decomposed into two sub-models: client sub-model and server sub-model. These two sub-models can be solved using traditional queuing network analysis method such as MVA algorithm. It is proposed to predict performance of distributed software system based on existed queuing network analysis technique. The client sub-model calculates think time for server sub-model, and the server sub-model calculates waiting time for client sub-model. The overall model can be solved by iteration from one sub-model to the next sub-model. Then the basic model is extended to multiplayer client-server queuing network. This solution for multilayer client-server queuing network is called NLQN.},

This article presents an online conversational agent based on the dialogic teaching strategy for learning Chinese at college level. Our experimental results showed that there were no significant differences in student learning performance between the dialogic teaching and narrative teaching. The system performance is challenging and might negatively affect the impact of the dialog-based teaching strategy on student learning. However, the findings illustrated that students felt that the system-delivered learning experience was interesting, which helped them to think independently.},

  abstract={Intelligence is a multifaceted concept that is generally defined as the ability of comprehending the environment, reasoning, planning, thinking, and learning. The Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is a well-known measure of cognitive abilities associated with intelligence. Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that brain structure and function are related to IQ, which varies from person to person. In this study, we investigated the potential of neuronal effective (directional) connectivity, computed using regression Dynamic Causal Modeling (rDCM) applied to resting-state fMRI data from 100 unrelated subjects in the HCP database, as a source of information for IQ estimation. We used permutation t-test and step-wise wrapper methods to select 24 significant features derived from directional connectivity and applied machine learning algorithms of Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with 7-fold cross-validation to predict IQ. The results showed a reasonable IQ estimate, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of about 2 points and a prediction determination coefficient (R2) of about 70 percent. Our findings suggest that neuronal effective connectivity may provide valuable information for IQ estimation and support further investigation into its potential as a biomarker for intelligence.},

  abstract={The main aim of the paper is to establish a simulation environment for inquiry-based learning, in which learners can explore and think possible solutions of stray dogs problems in Taiwan. First, researchers collect related information of stray dogs in Taipei city and use Net Logo to build the model for simulating the both natural and social phenomena (i.e. stray dogs problem). "Agents", including stray dogs, dog-catchers, and animal rescuers, are designed and adjusted on the basis of the collected actual information to make simulation results more meaningful for learning. The main contribution of this study is to allow learners to experience the complexity of the social phenomena and the interaction between associated factors so that they can realize the research process of social science. Although the established model of the simulated learning environment for stray dogs is not very precise, it doesn't affect the design and process of the learning activity. The future research will conduct educational experiments of the designed learning activity with integration of the simulated environment for stray dogs and evaluate learners' cognitive and affective changes before and after the experiments.},

  abstract={Aiming at the problem of grammar and semantic information understanding of the network structure of software system, this paper proposes a method of software defect prediction, which is based on Transformer model, which is completely dependent on self-attention mechanism, it can embed key information in the code semantics of the end-to-end learning software modules. Firstly, the software module is converted into an abstract syntax tree, and later it is traversed to extract word sequence of the software module. Then, thinking of the word sequence as input, acts on the self-attention layer to perform semantic feature embedding of the software module. Finally, the Softmax neural network is used to predict the software defect. The experimental results show that the software defect prediction method based on Transformer model has better defect prediction effects in the three open source software, and it has an average increase of 3.2% than the optimal model based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).},

  abstract={The organizational environment increasingly requires that information systems are capable of meeting changing business needs. This situation is evidenced in the general cost profile of systems development where the bulk of spending and effort lies in the (evolutionary) maintenance, integration and interoperability of existing systems. This situation provides a challenge to the generally accepted approaches to systems development and, in response, one stream of thought seeks to divorce business issues from the underlying technology platforms by placing 'models' at the heart of systems development. In principle, model-driven approaches see the system development process as consisting only of models and their transformations. A concern for these approaches is that of providing a structure within which models can be developed at the right level of abstraction and can then be transformed into more concrete models. In fundamental terms, however, model-driven development requires significant thinking in relation to both models and the modeling process.},

  abstract={Today, the 3D evaluation of digitized medical image data is a routine examination in certain medical fields, we can think of the use of CT (Computer Tomography) or MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) equipment. In contrast, the evaluation of 3D images and 3D data in digital pathology has not yet reached this level. One of the reasons for this is the resolution of digitized pathological sections, as well as the computing capacity required for the 3D reconstruction model created from them. In the course of our research, we designed and developed a solution that helps overcome difficulties arising from hardware resources with a technique called real-time network video streaming. Our solution enables users to collaboratively visualize 3D medical data even on low computing capacity devices. In the paper, we describe a part of this solution, which refers to the definition of the quality of service indicator. In our research, we implemented several solutions to define quality service in order to provide the best possible result to the user. In the paper, we describe and compare these solutions.},

  abstract={One of the defining characteristics of engineering is the use of models in problem solving. Graphic models or cartoon-like depictions of an identified body of interest are used to design, to simulate, to test hypotheses and to make predictions. While students are repeatedly exposed to free body diagrams, circuit schematics and other forms of pictorial modeling in their textbooks and lectures, faculty repeatedly complain that students overlook the models and just seek an equation that they think fits the problem situation - a situation characterized as "plugging and chugging". This indicates that students do not fully understand the function these models serve as visual representations of mathematical models and provisional hypotheses of the problem space. The goal of this interactive workshop is to give engineering educators better tools to scaffold this process.},

In particular, knowledge of trending topics provides us with information about what people are attracted to and what they think is noteworthy. Yet detecting trending topics from a set of texts is a difficult task, requiring detectors to learn trending patterns while simultaneously making predictions. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model architecture for the challenging task of trend detection and forecasting. The model architecture aims to learn and attend to the trending values' patterns. Our preliminary results show that our model detects the trending topics with a high accuracy.},

  abstract={Today, we assist to the explosive development of mobile computing devices like PDAs and cellphones, the integration of embedded intelligence (like Web server) in more and more common devices, and the proliferation of wireless communication technologies (IRdA, Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11, GPRS). All these trends contribute to move us closer to the ubiquitous computing world described by Mark Weiser. But while the technology is here, applications, and more important, models and tools for designing future ambient computing systems are still rare. One of the first innovative concepts of ubiquitous computing, context-awareness is still hard to use and understand from a programming perspective. We think that the problem resides in the lack of system support: in traditional computing, operating system offers simple to use and easy to understand abstractions of computational resources. Ubiquitous computing involves an integration of "computing" into the real-world, which is a radically different environment for applications. We think that this environment requires new operating system services and abstractions. Because the real world is made of physical entities, "living" in the physical space, ambient computing software should be able to use abstraction representing such objects, in a simple way. In this paper, we present a light framework to design ubiquitous computing software, called SPREAD. Unlike many approaches which hides too much of the real-world behind traditional computing abstraction, SPREAD defines programming abstraction based on the properties of the physical space. Hence, physical properties, like relative proximity, are used as implicitly in SPREAD as variable addressing in a computer memory. In SPREAD, application (or process) behavior can be "mechanically" driven, in the sense that actions flow can be directly dependent of physical mobility. To support this concept, we introduce a programming and execution model allowing designing computing and information systems driven directly by arranging and moving physical objects in the space. We demonstrate the use of the model to implement a few practical applications, highlighting its simplicity and expression power.},

  abstract={Many Collect ive Adaptive Systems (CASs) exist in nature: think of ant colonies, where large collectives of ants operate autonomously but interact with other ants and the environment to provide resilient global behaviors that sustain their colony. Following scientific studies that were aimed at understanding and predicting the evolution of these systems, and fueled by technological advances, research has started to investigate CAS engineering: the methods, tools, and techniques for building CASs. This naturally leads to a vision where collectives of humans and computational elements, situated both in the digital and physical worlds, collaborate to give rise to "intelligent" collective behavior supporting novel kinds of applications and services. Humans can be involved in two ways: both as users and as components of the CAS, in the sense that human behaviors and limitations are often integral to the system description. This has significant social implications that need to be considered by CAS researchers: in this paper, we share a discussion that took place between some experts thinking about CAS engineering, focusing on the social implication of CASs and related open research challenges. We hope that this provides a useful context for future research projects, research grant proposals, and research directions.},

  abstract={The thrust of this article is this: There is a need now, more than ever before, for men to stretch their capacities in what we shall call evolutionary skills. Moreover, it is at last becoming possible technologically to enhance these skills in man by incorporating somewhat similar evolutionary skills in the machines which we design and build. However, if engineers are to develop machines with evolutionary capabilities, they will need to restructure their own way of thinking, throw out traditional ways of thinking, and find their way, through playing with evolutionary design techniques, into an ever-deepening understanding of the significance of such techniques. They must bootstrap themselves into a new kind of ``think,'' into a new climate of man-machine interaction, in which men evolve intelligent machines and intelligent machines evolve men. This new kind of think is what this article tries to unfold in an effort to spur lively support for the evolutionary direction.},
