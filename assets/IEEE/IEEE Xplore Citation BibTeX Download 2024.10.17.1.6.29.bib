  abstract={Cloud Data Centers are becoming a more and more important reality nowadays, as more and more services are being offered in the form of Cloud resources. In order to accommodate as many requests as possible, Data Centers typically deploy oversubscription, which requires a thoughtfully calibrated usage of the computing and network resources of the system. We especially need to re-think the usage of network resources, as the kinds of demands from applications we see today have more stringent network requirements than in the past. The Software-Defined Network paradigm offers new tools to manage the network in agile, flexible ways, according to specific needs. It enables to build new customized functions in order, for example, to monitor the instantaneous load of traffic, slice the network, route each flow according to specific policies that can be modified accordingly with the needs of the system. In this paper we present an orchestrator for Software-Defined Data Center, and the strategies used to allocate Virtual Machines, basing our decisions on the current state of the system.},

The basic idea is to acquire human intent in the product model by the application of improved communication process between human and information content based model creation procedure. Analyses were conducted to reveal characteristics of information content during process of human thinking about engineering objects and in interactive definition of product entities. New information content based modeling procedures and model entities were defined and structured. Conventional product model structure was rearranged for its improved communication with the information context based entities. The proposed methodology utilizes model description of complex intent composed using intent of several influencing humans. Knowledge advising in recent PLM systems for definition, import, capturing, sharing, reusing, management, and maintenance of corporate knowledge is considered as an entry-level starting point to information content based product modeling.

The criteria for weighing the software is the precision of the results with an acceptable time of calculation to simulate different models with multiple variables. The existance of COMSOL 3.3, at a time linking all the physics and having a good interactive interface seemed to be a good solution. Being new, and under development, COMSOL 3.3 needed to be valid on different points and specialy needs to be linked to another software to complete what COMSOL cannot do. As a first step, we validated the numerical platform by comparing results of different softwares and also some analytical solutions. The basic advantages and drawbacks of each software were considered then we have developed a method to link COMSOL and ANSYS since we think they are complementary.

  abstract={A technique called "Low-Cost Computing" has been attracting public attention in recent years. "Low-Cost Computing" is a method aimed at achieving the same level of performance of expensive commercial equipment or dedicated equipment by combining common, inexpensive equipment, software and services. One example of "Low-Cost Computing" is "virtual currency". Virtual currency often uses "distributed network" as an underlying technology. In a distributed network, data is stored using users' computers rather than a server for centralized data management. In short, virtual currency is realized by using the network to combine the users' computers. We think of this as "Network-Based Low-Cost Computing". There are many services using "Network-Based Low-Cost Computing", and they are becoming the mainstream of modern computers. As opposed to this, we propose "Infrastructure-Based Low-Cost Computing" in this research. "Infrastructure-Based Low-Cost Computing" proposed in this research means "combining commonly available devices and software to propose an environment for teleconference or remote class, and building an infrastructure with equivalent functionality to expensive systems or services". In this research, as the first step of this method, we aim to construct, with "Low-Cost Computing", a low-cost remote class environment which anyone can use. In this paper, we constructed a remote class environment with "Low-Cost Computing", and held classes at Toyo University. At the end of the remote class session, we conducted a survey on the remote class constructed in this research. Based on the survey results, we will summarize and consider the evaluation of remote class environment made available through "Low-Cost Computing".},

One of the characteristics is, large-dimensional data that needs to be analyzed; for example, high resolution images used in social media are used for sentiment analysis. Our research is oriented towards discovering approaches where stage-by-stage processing is done to bring out most salient features from high-dimensional data. However, we observe that data block processing, in most of the conventional approaches, does not scale well for higher dimensionality. Instead, we think of making blocks along the feature set and we propose a divide-and-conquer based feature extraction framework based on feature set partitioning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework using various feature set partitioning based PCA approaches.},

  abstract={Geometry is one of the oldest branches of science in mathematics that studies the shape of fields and spaces applied by architects and building technicians. Studying geometry provides many basic skills and helps to build thinking skills in analytical reasoning and problem-solving logic. Geometry is useful for understanding space in a real-life that helps in understanding better concepts. With the help of Smartphones as an information technology tool, today can simplify the calculation of a flat build. In this study will be presented the use of computer vision to calculate several types of flat shapes. The automatic calculation of the flat shape formula becomes a solution to calculate quickly to correct the answers to mathematical questions about regular or irregular flat shapes. The calculation process is done by detecting a flat shape that is taken using a Smartphone camera. Once detected, the image is converted into a binary image. Then the measurement of each pixel in the object image is measured, then the formula to be used and the calculation are processed by the application submitted. This study will utilize the Chain Code technique as a digital image processing which functions to generate codes in the form of several numbers based on the direction of the wind. This chain code can represent curves, lines, or contours of a field, determine circumference and area, and can determine the form factor of an object. From this method, it is used to detect objects and then scaling the size of objects so that the formula of the flat building that will be identified can be applied. The results showed that the detection of 2-dimensional objects was quite accurate with a percentage of 57.57% of 33 tests, and with 3 models of variation testing.},

In order to solve the difficult problem using theory of quotient space, the original universe of discourse space X will be turned into the new granular universe[X]. The process actually implies the idea of extenics. Extension method is mainly used to solve contradictory problems by transformations of matter-elements. So we integrate extension method with theory of quotient space to solve some complicated problems in artificial intelligence system, and set up an extension-based quotient space computing model. It provides a good scheme to find feasible approximate solutions in the problem space and realize relations and transformations between granule and granule in the whole granular worlds. And it also provides a new method for solving difficult problem. So it has great theory significance and practical value.},

But an important issue is not really described on the standards and even on the related guides for surge protection application: what is the real influence of the AC surge protector on the AC network, especially during their operation? As we know, the Power Quality (PQ) is a key point for the process continuity, the safety and even for the life expectancy of the sensitive devices connected to the AC distribution network: during their operation on surges, the surge protectors could generate some phenomena which could create disturbances or troubles on the AC network. Because the AC surge protectors are from different technologies and because the AC networks could have several configurations, many cases are possible, even the worse... Market analysis shows sometimes a low confidence of the end user in the surge protection, not because he thinks it is not efficient, but because he supposes the use of SPD could bring extra disturbances on his installation. For this reason, an in depth information about the real interaction would be useful.},

  abstract={Deployment of server virtualization almost becomes a universal basic concept of making full use of the data center resources. With the evolution trend for powerful multi-core servers, more memory capacity, and greater bandwidth network channel, it is necessary to think about the network I/O. To contribute this issue, Ezilla has been developed by Pervasive Computing Team at National Center for High-performance Computing (NCHC). Ezilla integrates the Cloud middleware, virtualization technology, and Web-based Operating System (WebOS) to build virtual machines in the distributed computing environment. The main character of Ezilla is simplifying a lot complexity of utilizing Clouds. Via the Ezilla with SR-IOV feature, Cloud users can create virtual clusters that are customized to meet the specific needs from the users. Our goal is to make scientists or users painlessly run their works on Clouds, and greatly improve the network I/O performance.},
