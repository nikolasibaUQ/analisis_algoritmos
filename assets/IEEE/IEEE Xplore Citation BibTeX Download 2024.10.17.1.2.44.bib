  abstract={The curse of dimensionality is a well-established phenomenon. However, the properties of high dimensional data are often poorly understood and overlooked during the process of data modelling and analysis. Similarly, how to optimally fuse different modalities is still a big research question. In this paper, we addressed these challenges by proposing a novel two level brain-inspired compression based optimised multimodal fusion framework for emotion recognition. In the first level, the framework extracts the compressed and optimised multimodal features by applying a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based compression on each modality (i.e. audio, text, and visuals). The second level simply concatenates the extracted optimised and compressed features for classification. The performance of the proposed approach with two different compression levels (i.e. 78% and 98%) is compared with late fusion (class level-1 dimension, class probabilities level-4 dimension) and early fusion (feature level-72000 dimension). The simulation results and critical analysis have demonstrated up to 10% and 5% performance improvement as compared to the state-of-the-art support vector machine (SVM) and long-short-term memory (LSTM) based multimodal emotion recognition systems respectively. We hypothesise that there exist an optimal level of compression at which optimised multimodal features could be extracted from each modality, which could lead to a significant performance improvement.},

  abstract={Fake news caused worldwide alarm because its impacts are unprecedented due to the AI technology that can create fake video so vividly and proliferate fake news as fast as a viral spread. In response to the threat, various efforts or actions have been initiated such as fact-checking, algorithmic, platform design, and policy changes. However, evidences show the volume of false stories circulated on social media remains high. To solve the problem of fake news needs an interdisciplinary effort, not only technology but also social and political input. We propose a good solution through a collaborative project that develops a trusting news platform by A.I. and blockchain technology and effectively utilizes the common supervisory power of the society. In addition, we propose studies from humanity perspectives in order to give some guide-lines and fundamental base for creating a trusting news ecosystem.},

  pages={524-531},
  abstract={We consider the problem of constructing critical paths from incomplete information. In general, a directed acyclic graph of tasks with their execution times (i.e., a task graph) is necessary to extract critical paths. We assume, however, that only the set of tasks, and their start and end times are known, e.g., an execution trace in the form of a Gantt chart. This information can be extracted from real machines or from the output of analysis tools, whereas extraction of the exact task graph often is problematic due to imperative modeling formalisms and complicated platform semantics (resource allocation, varying execution speeds). We show that, based on start and end times only, an over- approximation of the critical paths of an unknown task graph can be extracted nevertheless. Furthermore, this approach is generalized to deal with "noisy" execution traces of real machines in which control overhead is present. Finally, we discuss various methods to deal with false positives, and apply our approach to a complex industrial case study.},

  abstract={Today, the advancement in Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) pave the way for establishing a simulated three-dimensional world for educational purpose and interactive learning. AR technology witness an increasing usage in recent years in the learning process of several areas of knowledge. However, using AR in education is still a big challenge and limited. There are certain constrains linked to the perception of learners to use AR as well as it is unclear to what extent this technology improves the spatial performance of learners in certain academics. Another question this study tries to answer, why AR is more effective than VR in preserving knowledge in learners’ minds. The purpose of this paper is to review the most important theories and reports on AR in education, and its connection to human spatial memory. The review of literature reveals that VR is an efficient technology and provide good tools for spatial memory research, but it still not compared with respect to spatial performance with AR. The significant impact of AR on learning ability of student is high by creating a sustainable and immersive education environment which enhance students’ spatial memory, especially in academic fields that are based on visual topics.},

  pages={601-606},
  abstract={From the perspective of information security engineering, ISO/IEC 15408, one of ISO/IEC security standards, plays an important role to ensure the whole security of an information/software system. ISO/IEC 15408 is a complex security standard which requires involvement of wide range of participants to perform a quite number of tasks as well as various documents. ISO/IEC 15408 is periodically reviewed and maintained to achieve ongoing improvement so that workflow of tasks and contents/format of documents related with the standard are changed according to changes of the standards. Consequently, it is difficult to do all of the tasks related with ISO/IEC 15408 without any supporting tools. However, there is no study to identify which tasks related with ISO/IEC 15408 can be supported by software tools. Indeed, no one makes clear what the tasks and participants exist. This paper presents the first analysis to identify all software supportable tasks related with ISO/IEC 15408. The paper enumerates all of the participants, documents, and tasks related with ISO/IEC 15408 and shows relationship among them, and identifies all software supportable tasks. The analysis and its results become a basis to construct an information security engineering environment based on ISO/IEC 15408 for ensuring the whole security of an information/software system.},

  abstract={Many methods have been studied for mining association rules efficiently. However, because these methods usually generate a large number of rules, it is still a heavy burden for the users to find the most interesting ones. In this paper, we propose a novel method for finding what the user is interested in by assigning several keywords, like searching documents on the WWW by search engines. We build an ontology to describe the concepts and relationships in the research domain and mine association rules by Genetic Network Programming from the database where the attributes are concepts in ontology. By considering both the semantic similarity between the rules and the keywords, and the statistical information like support, confidence, chi-squared value, we could rank the rules by a new method named RuleRank, where genetic algorithm is applied to adjust the parameters and the optimal ranking model is built for the user. Experiments show that our approach is effective for the users to find what they want.},

  year={2018},

  pages={950-957},
  abstract={Scientific creativity refers to exploration of original scientific development/creation. Although there are evidences of research on artistic creativity, including painting, music etc., there is hardly any research outcome on the biological basis of scientific creativity. This paper attempts to provide the biological basis of scientific creativity by identifying the brain activation patterns during the mental progress of scientific creation. It explores the scope of inductive learning in the psychological process of scientific concept formation from the commonality of positive instances of inductive learning, and use the formed concept to solve unknown problem, preferably in a new domain. The learning of the subject is monitored by acquiring the N400 brain signal and the correct application of the concept learnt to the unknown problem is detected by P300 event related potential. To identify the brain lobes involved in the learning (and planning) phase, we first trained an interval type-2 fuzzy-neural classifier with known input instances collected from selected (literature-provided) brain lobes and classes defined by N400 (P300) response of the subject. We then test the classifier performance by submitting arbitrarily selected brain lobe patterns as input to the classifier. In case the classifier produces the right class for the given input instance then the arbitrarily selected brain region carries significance in the learning (planning) phases. We declare a brain region responsible for learning/planning and hence creativity, if repeated testing of the region yields favorable outcomes of the pre-trained classifier. Experiments undertaken on 60 pre-college students indicate that pre-frontal and frontal lobes are responsible for inductive learning and prefrontal, parietal and occipital lobes for planning/scientific creativity. We also validate the brain region activation by using e-LORETA software.},

  abstract={Work design theory research has a long and rich tradition in the industrial and organisational psychology. Work design identifies tasks, activities, relationships, and responsibilities in a specific job. It provides a comprehensive job description useful for examining and creating optimal working conditions, also by developing empowering workers or by restructuring their responsibilities. Human-robot interaction is among the domains with a high demand for work design. It is related to the widespread human fear of being replaced by machines at work, as well as the still small number of publications in this field, mostly devoted to human-robot interaction analysis conditions. Scholars have identified an elaborated set of tasks by a human during working with a robot. From work design perspective, besides expanding what tasks are considered, it is crucial to consider its meaning for creating critical psychological states, which are important for individual and organisational results. Thus, the paper preparation’s impetus describes and analyses the tasks carried out by robot operators in a more precise manner, by using psychological work analysis from the work design perspective. The research group consists of 32 robot operators from a large international manufacturing company. The Work Design Questionnaire (WDQ) by Morgeson and Humphrey (2006) was used to describe 21 of work characteristics. Results show that Task Variety, Information Processing, Task Identity, Specialisation, Skill Variety, Problem-solving, Task Significance, Received Interdependence, Feedback From Others, and Feedback from Job are the highest work characteristics of robot operators. It suggests that robot operators distinguish non-routine, cognitive, and interpersonal tasks as more substantial than other tasks. Alike, according to the work design theory, the work characteristics indicated by respondents are recognised as important job-specific factors for workers’ critical psychological states i.e., experiencing meaning, feeling responsible for outcomes, and understanding the results of their efforts, and helping shape the context of the work. It is imperative that further and more extensive research is conducted to bring more attention to how work design can support individuals’ cognitive, social, and identity development in human-robot interaction.},

The main task of this study is to emphasize the role of personality traits in the employee's job satisfaction and to study the impact of personality traits such as neuroticism, extraversion and psychoticism on job satisfaction. The variables include big five personality traits and job satisfaction. The main focus of this work reveals that there is no substantial link within the following big five factors and the job satisfaction. The above-mentioned factors would importantly impact on job satisfaction. The examination of linkage between factors like neuroticism, extraversion, psychoticism and job satisfaction was carried out using the correlation analyzing. This study was conducted to collect the main data using the purposive sampling method. The distinctive feature of this study is the collection, processing and analysis of consolidated information from personal questionnaires depending on the type of professional activity of the sixty employees in aviation industry. Two questionnaires i.e. Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-revised (EPQ-R) and Job Satisfaction Survey were used to make an assessment of the impact of personality traits on the overall level of job satisfaction. The future impact of this study can support to increase the productivity level of the employees and also, spread awareness about the positive impact of extraverted personality traits on the job satisfaction.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a two-tiered, evolutionary architecture for computer based synthesis of textures. In this architecture, a traditional tree based texture generation system is controlled by a set of evolutionary agents. The main contribution of this work is that the user is able to choose the degree of interaction and control they exert over the system. Evolutionary agents are designed to contain information about desirable image features, and they evolve based on user feedback. The agents in turn control the main evolutionary engine for generating textures. This system allows the computer to continue working when the designer leaves without limiting the designerpsilas ability to control the texture generation process when they are available to interact with the system. An experimental implementation is developed to verify the utility of the proposed architecture for texture synthesis. Results show significant improvements in the average user ranking of the agents as the genetic algorithm progresses.},

  year={2011},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={367-372},
  abstract={Monotone prediction problems, in which the target variable is non-decreasing given an increase of the explanatory variables, have became more popular nowadays in many problem settings which fulfill the so-called monotonicity constraint, namely, if an object is better in all attributes as another one then it should not be classified lower. Recent approaches to monotone prediction consider linear ordering on attribute domains, thus the meaning of being better in an attribute is limited to having a larger or a lower value in that attribute. However, this limitation restricts the use of recent approaches in cases where middle or marginal values of an attribute are better, what is natural in many real-world scenarios. We present a simple attribute value-transformation approach in this paper. The idea is to map attribute domains to real values where the mapped values express how the given value of an attribute contributes to higher classification of objects. Thus, we are searching for an data-specific approximation of a fuzzy membership function on the domain of each (numerical) attribute. Then, instead of the original attribute values we use their mapped values to mitigate the violation of monotonicity constraints in the data. Our approach is quite simple and is not limited to numerical attributes only. The described approach was tested and evaluated on benchmark datasets from the UCI machine learning repository.},

  abstract={One of the main goals of the Arabic world since decades has been to search, bring and deliver new sources and forms of art in the field of interior design and architecture that could satisfy the recent increasing human demands. Today people strive to showcase their tradition and cultural heritage in the modern world. People of Arabic Peninsula are all about representing the beauty of their Islamic culture in unique contemporary ways that would astonish the world. Arabic calligraphy is one of such sources. The distinctive geometric shapes and forms of different character types and styles like Kufi, Naskh, Diwani, Thuluth etc., gives designers the opportunity to design and develop exquisite pieces of art in both interior design and architectural field. The design elements of modern interior design act as a guiding principle infusing this art form in design. Modern Arab interior and architectural designs are incredibly unique yet sophisticated and luxurious. The usage of calligraphy in design can prove to be a substantial method of portraying history and culture expressed through the character of letters to be used in furniture, columns, ceiling, architectural buildings etc. This paper shows how Arabic calligraphy is not limited to just traditional decorative purposes but can have much wider application at both macro and micro level in modern world of design. It is a great source of inspiration for designers attempting to integrate the art of calligraphy in design of modern furniture as well as architectural structures. The paper demonstrates how designers like Zaha Hadid, and many others borrowed this traditional art form, infused it with modern touch and took it to new heights of contemporary design through their modernized lenses and vision. The ravishing amalgam of calligraphy and design can give birth to some magnificent and timeless masterpieces in future.},

Several interesting theoretical results related to this problem (e.g. for optimization) are also given.

  abstract={In this paper a tool is presented for the automation of horizon scanning. Horizon scanning is the systematic process of examining the scientific literature to identify opportunities, risks, threats and emerging issues. This tool has been named the Autonomous information Comprehension Engine (AiCE). AiCE has the ability to ingest large quantities of unstructured text based data from a variety of sources, extract a wide variety of features and analyse trends across the corpus of collected source material. AiCE is used to analyse science and technology literature and identify developments which may be of strategic relevance to a specific domain. In this paper AiCE is introduced and its components are outlined. The benefit of the proposed system is demonstrated through a time expenditure study comparing this new system to the traditional manual process of horizon scanning. The proposed system is also demonstrated by analysing literature from the computer vision community to extract relevant research to the natural language processing community.},

  abstract={Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) has been studied in ways never before possible because to breakthroughs in brain imaging technology. Indirectly, the accuracy and interpretability of findings affect our understanding of neurodevelopmental processes, highlighting the crucial necessity of dependable techniques. There are a wide variety of obstacles to overcome in this field, from the intricacies of researching developing brains to the subtle interplay of different cognitive processes. Overcoming these problems demands creative approaches and enhanced procedures that can capture the changing character of cognitive growth. The goal of this framework is to improve the accuracy and sensitivity of cognitive neuroscience studies, leading to a deeper comprehension of the complex mechanisms at play during brain development. In this study, there is a method called functional magnetic resonance-based tensor imaging (FMR-TI) that combines the strengths of both methods to provide more precise mapping of cognitive growth throughout time. As a bonus, the suggested method uses simulation analyses to verify its efficiency and resilience in capturing the nuances of cognitive development, making the results of the study more trustworthy. The proposed methodology can be used to a wide range of fields, such as educational neuroscience, clinical psychology, and developmental neuroscience. Understanding cognitive growth better has far-reaching effects on educational programs, diagnostic methods, and treatment plans. Moreover, this methodological improvement holds promise for unraveling the neurological foundations of neurodevelopmental diseases, helping to the development of focused therapies and tailored treatment strategies. The robustness of the processing, the flexibility of the paradigm, and the validity of the simulation are all taken into account during the investigation.},

  abstract={Collaboration performance is often enriched by the interaction of a diversity of personalities and opinions in a team. There is little research on discussion-assistance systems to monitor and control the state of diversity and cohesion of opinions. This study proposes a system that guides participants to concentrate on differences in their opinions and to reach a decision with more satisfied agreement by encouraging cognitive empathy (i.e., understanding others’ thoughts). The system evaluates the similarity of opinions among participants, then it provides feedback on the similarity score to them. Receiving the feedback, participants can determine the necessity of the exchange of opinions to converge the discussion (not debate). We prepared a team-building task in which two participants alternately presented their opinions based on individual thoughts and emotions; then, they checked the similarity between their opinions and discussed cooperatively them to reach an agreement. We show that the feedback of opinion similarity score increases cognitive empathy, which is also objectively validated by observation of brain activities. Particularly, we observed the strong phase-synchronicity of theta wave between the discussion participants’ left lateral prefrontal cortexes. Satisfaction of participants with the result of the discussion marginally increased and the similarity score of their opinions significantly increased along with the task process. In conclusion, the feedback system during the team task promoted positively the consideration of their own and their partner’s emotions and thoughts. This study also contributes to hyperscanning studies in real-life situations because it used a simple electroencephalographic device and experimental design in communication.},
