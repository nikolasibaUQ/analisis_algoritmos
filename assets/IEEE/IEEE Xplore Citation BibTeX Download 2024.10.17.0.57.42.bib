  abstract={The work presented in this Full Paper is categorized as Innovative Practice, as per FIE guidelines. Robofest is a worldwide robotics competition program for students in 4th-12th grade and college. Student teams design, construct, and program their autonomous robots in a variety of competition categories. In the 2019–2020 academic year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we designed an innovative and novel online robotics competition format using Zoom Webinar tools rather than cancelling the world championship competition. The purpose of this paper is to show how we designed, implemented synchronized online robotics competitions, and to analyze the results and efficacy of the Robofest Online World championships (ROWC). One hundred and fifty-three teams comprising of 360 students competed in three age divisions and six categories held weekends from Aug. 28 through Oct. 10, 2020. Most teams set up playing fields at home and we trained judges online prior to the competitions. We sent the description of an unknown game ending task and unknown playing field factors to local volunteer judges at the same time just before the 30-minute work time on the competition day. After checking to make sure that all the teams were ready to play, we sent the game start signal to all the teams at the same time through Zoom. The local judges scored the runs and submitted videos to the Robofest office for score verification. Robofest office staff also proctored the competitions through Zoom screens for fair competition results and maximum learning opportunities. It was an innovative practice of using online conference tools to organize the world's first unique “synchronized” online autonomous robotics competitions for engineering and computing education. Anonymous coach & judge survey results after the ROWC showed that the satisfaction rate was better than the in-person competition surveys of previous years. Additionally, 95 % of students surveyed after the ROWC exposure said that they would now consider a career involving STEM versus 91 % of students surveyed after the 2019 in-person competitions.},

  abstract={The Digital Logic and Computer Architecture related courses are one of the key knowledge areas in Computer Science (CS) used to enhance students' understanding of Boolean algebra, logic gates, registers, arithmetic logic units, etc. and provides insights how software and hardware are related in a computing system. Experimental Centric based Instructional Pedagogy (ECP) with portable laboratory instrumentation might provide real hands-on experience to obtain a practical understanding of the concepts at a lower cost compared to virtual hands-on laboratories. This paper presents the initial adaptation of an evidence-based, experiment-focused teaching approach to introduce the fundamentals of digital logic concepts using the commercial ADALM 1K Active Learning Module in a Computer Architecture course for the first time in the CS department at a university serving predominantly minority students. To evaluate the impact of the ECP on student performance in the Computer Architecture course, we conducted three different evaluations, which are class observation, signature assignment, and the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaires (MLSQ) survey. The results of the Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM (COPUS) show more student engagement when ECP is implemented; the output of the signature assignment shows an increase in students' learning outcomes; and the MLSQ survey, which tests the students' motivation, critical thinking, curiosity, collaboration, and metacognition, ascertains the effect of the ECP on the CS students who participated in the experiment.},

  abstract={This innovative practice work in progress paper discusses the integration of Model-Eliciting Activities (MEA) into in software engineering (SE) classes, and the challenges faced in preparing and delivering these activities. The preparation and implementation of MEA in SE classes can be challenging, as it requires creating self-assessable MEA questions that simulate real-world problems, ensuring the integration of MEA in SE course topics, providing feedback, and analyzing learning outcomes. In this research, the authors address these challenges and gain practical experience in designing and implementing MEA in SE classes. The authors conducted experiments over two consecutive semesters in SE courses that cover topics such as requirement solicitation, design and implementation, software testing techniques, secure software, and software quality assurance. They incorporated MEA questions that simulate real-world problems into both face-to-face and online classes, ensuring the integration of MEA in SE course topics, providing feedback, and analyzing the learning gains. This paper contributes to the distribution of MEA application for SE courses. It presents the authors' experiences, challenges, reports evaluations, and findings in implementing MEA in SE courses. Overall, this paper provides insights into the effective integration of MEA into SE courses, and the benefits it can bring to students' learning outcomes.},

  abstract={The computer chess is an important research direction of artificial intelligence. Amazon chess game is an extremely complicated strategy game and the search algorithm relies heavily on the evaluation function. The design of evaluation function faces great challenges. This process requires a comprehensive consideration of the characteristics of the board and build up a series of complex formulas, which requires a lot of human experience to support. The author tries to apply the reinforcement learning method to the design process of Game of the Amazons evaluation function. Using the self-game generated data sets and reward signals to stimulates network, it could learn how to evaluate the situation of chess board without human experience. Then this neural network can be used as an evaluation function. Finally, through battling with the game of Amazon chess game using traditional evaluation function, it is verified that the evaluation function design method proposed in this paper can reduce the human experience requirement in the design process of Game of the Amazons evaluation function and effectively evaluate the situation.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently been used as a tool for various visual storytelling, but text-to-image models are a stochastic machine learning process that requires human intervention to assist creation better. As we all know, pre-visualization is an important stage in film production, involving subjective choices by the creators. This paper investigates how AI can assist filmmakers during the pre-production stage by generating mood boards from text. We propose a novel preproduction pipeline and guidelines that leverage text-to-image models to create visual previews of film projects. We also conduct a case study to validate and evaluate our approach's effectiveness. Our case study suggests that following the guidelines we have developed can assist filmmakers in generating mood boards that effectively convey the desired atmosphere of their projects and potentially contribute to enhancing the creative process. Our paper aims to contribute to the field of AI art and the film industry.},

  abstract={As computing technologies develop, there is a trend in traffic simulation research in which the focus is moving from macro- and meso-simulation to micro-simulation since micro-simulation can provide more detailed quantitative results. Moreover, the success of the Artificial societies-Computational experiments-Parallel execution (ACP) approach indicates that integrating other metropolitan systems such as logistic, infrastructure, legal and regulatory, and weather and environmental systems to build an Artificial Transportation System (ATS) can be helpful in solving Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) problems. However, the computational burden is very heavy as there are many agents interacting in parallel in the ATS. Therefore, a parallel computing tool is desirable. We think that we can employ a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), which has been applied in many areas. In this paper, we use a GPU-adapted Parallel Genetic Algorithm (PGA) to solve the problem of generating daily activity plans for individual and household agents in the ATS, which is important as the activity plans determine the traffic demand in the ATS. Previous research has shown that GA is effective but that the computational burden is heavy. We extend the work to GPU and test our method on an NVIDIA Tesla C2050 GPU for two scenarios of generating plans for 1000 individual agents and 1000 three-person household agents. Speedup factors of 23 and 32 are obtained compared with implementations on a mainstream CPU.},

The emerging discipline of Computational Science brings Thinkers and Software Experts together to create environments for Thinkers. Thinkers are well educated domain and problem focused computationally literate end users. On a day by day basis thinkers live in Big Data to collaboratively solve their business and technical challenges. Thinkers reject being passive misunderstood requirements changing Agile customers. They have no use for end user tools for dummies. They question the cost and complexity of accepted software engineering and IT approaches. Lacking better alternatives they often resort to hodge-podge collections of scripts and arcane tools.

  abstract={Artificial neural network is an intelligent bionic model based on physiology, which simulates the thinking ability of human brain, and finds out regular things by studying, recalling, summarizing and sorting out a large number of cases. Because of the heterogeneity, distribution and dynamics of grid, traditional resource management methods are not suitable for grid environment. In view of the fact that the traditional resource management model can't meet the demand of service grid, this paper studies the resource management model based on the principles of computational economics and the characteristics of service grid environment, and proposes a resource management model based on computational economics. Most of the traditional economic models based on econometrics are linear models. Although such a model is a powerful economic analysis tool, it also has its own defects, that is, it can not reflect a large number of nonlinear relationships in the economic system. In this paper, an artificial neural network is used to establish a national economic forecasting model. In the process of modeling, immune particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to optimize the weights and thresholds of the neural network model, so that the predicted data of the model is closer to the actual data.},

  abstract={A cellular automaton (CA) recently developed by D.H. Rothman and J.M. Keller (1988) simulates the flow of two incompressible, immiscible, viscous fluids in two dimensions. This automaton has been simulated on the CM-2 Connection Machine using a sequence of logical operations and table lookups to determine the state of a CA site from its old state and those of its neighbors. The logical operations are performed in parallel by each of the Connection Machine processors, while the table lookups use the indirect addressing capabilities among groups of 32 processors. A description is given of CA fluids, including the issue of isotropy, the choice of a rule set, and the averaging procedure used to obtain hydrodynamical quantities. The CM-2 Connection Machine is then described, with emphasis on the indirect addressing capabilities of the machine. A complete description is also given of the Rothman-Keller model for two-phase flow. It is shown how the indirect addressing is used in the simulation algorithm, and how a symmetry in the dynamics is used to reduce the size of the lookup tables by a factor of six. A time sequence of results showing the separation of two immiscible phases from an initially homogenized state is presented.<>},

  abstract={In the age of Big Data, efficient algorithms are in higher demand more than ever before. While Big Data takes us into the asymptotic world envisioned by our pioneers, it also challenges the classical notion of efficient algorithms: Algorithms that used to be considered efficient, according to polynomial-time characterization, may no longer be adequate for solving today's problems. It is not just desirable but essential that efficient algorithms should be scalable. In other words, their complexity should be nearly linear or sub-linear with respect to the problem size. Thus, scalability, not just polynomial-time computability, should be elevated as the central complexity notion for characterizing efficient computation. Scalable Algorithms for Data and Network Analysis surveys a family of algorithmic techniques for the design of scalable algorithms. These techniques include local network exploration, advanced sampling, sparsification, and geometric partitioning. They also include spectral graph-theoretical methods, such as are used for computing electrical flows and sampling from Gaussian Markov random fields. These methods exemplify the fusion of combinatorial, numerical, and statistical thinking in network analysis. Scalable Algorithms for Data and Network Analysis illustrates the use of these techniques by a few basic problems that are fundamental in analyzing network data, particularly for the identification of significant nodes and coherent clusters/communities in social and information networks. It also discusses some frameworks beyond graph-theoretical models for studying conceptual questions that arise in network analysis and social influences.},

  abstract={Hesitant fuzzy linguistic preference relation (HFLPR) is an utilitarian tool to capture diverse information from decision makers under uncertain situations. How to improve the unacceptable consistency level for HFLPR is a key issue to guarantee the reliability of the decision information. This paper introduces the worst consistency index for HFLPRs to judge the logic of DMs in the worst case. Under the purpose of minimizing the amount of modification, an optimization model is constructed to achieve an acceptable worst consistency level for a HFLPR. A linear programming model is established to reduce the difficulty of solving the presented optimization model. It ensures the consistency indices related to all the possible linguistic preference relations (LPRs) from a given HFLPR meet the predefined consistency level requirement. Finally, the proposed model is applied to a numerical example to show it's significance.},

  abstract={Autism Spectrum Disorder is a neuro-development behavioural disorder that is classified as a chronic disability leaving individuals unable to accurately grasp their environment and can lead to limited development of communication skills, thinking and other social skills. Prediction of ASD using video recordings is an open-ended critical problem in machine learning to facilitate the process of early intervention which requires high computational resources. This research aims to predict ASD in children using videos by extracting features and converting them into a binary classification problem thereby eliminating the need for high computational resources. This research postulates a study of machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Neural Networks in comparison for the prediction of ASD as well as a novel approach to reduce the computational requirements for the analysis of videos. This research also addresses the lack of publically available video datasets for the analysis of Autism. The highest accuracy metric for the models was using the Neural Network architecture closely followed by the Decision Tree Classifier which yielded accuracies of 99.8% and 99.65% respectively. In this article, we offer an overview of predicting Autism Spectrum Disorder whilst focusing on the importance of video datasets.},

  abstract={Hybrid state estimation determines the states of systems monitored both by conventional SCADA measurements and PMUs. This paper proposes a decentralization method in order to improve the computational performance of hybrid state estimators with minimum loss of accuracy. The proposed method utilizes sensitivity matrix that relates measurement errors to state estimates in order to form the so-called isolated bus groups and observable subislands. Although the proposed decentralization method can be applied to any state estimator, the paper is developed using a least absolute value (LAV) estimator for demonstration purposes, which is known to be robust against bad data. The high computational burden of LAV estimator compared to the well-known weighted least squares estimator is eliminated, thanks to the proposed decentralization method.},

  abstract={Reasoning, a trait of cognitive intelligence, is regarded as a crucial ability that distinguishes humans from other species. However, neural networks now pose a challenge to this human ability. Text-to-image synthesis is a class of vision and linguistics, wherein the goal is to learn multimodal representations between the image and text features. Hence, it requires a high-level reasoning ability that understands the relationships between objects in the given text and generates high-quality images based on the understanding. Text-to-image translation can be termed as the visual thinking of neural networks. In this study, our model infers the complicated relationships between objects in the given text and generates the final image by leveraging the previous history. We define diverse novel adversarial loss functions and finally demonstrate the best one that elevates the reasoning ability of the text-to-image synthesis. Remarkably, most of our models possess their own reasoning ability. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons with several methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach.},

  abstract={This paper explores impediments to innovation in aerospace and suggests how successful pathways from other industries can be adopted to facilitate greater innovation. Because of its nature, space exploration would seem to be a ripe field of technical innovation. However, engineering can also be a frustratingly conservative endeavor when the realities of cost and risk are included. Impediments like the ¿find the fault¿ engineering culture, the treatment of technical risk as almost always evaluated in terms of negative impact, the difficult to account for expansive Moore's Law growth when making predictions, and the stove-piped structural organization of most large aerospace companies and federally funded research laboratories tend to inhibit cross-cutting technical innovation. One successful example of a multi-use cross cutting application that can scale with Moore's Law is the Evolutionary Computational Methods (ECM) technique developed at the Jet Propulsion Lab for automated spectral retrieval. Future innovations like computational engineering and automated design optimization can potentially redefine space exploration, but will require learning lessons from successful innovators.},

Shape grammars have been used to represent the knowledge behind the creative work of architects, designers and artists. This kind of grammars are inherently visual and they allow the implementation of computational mechanisms to either synthesize or analyze designs of visual languages, including the detection of emergent sub-shapes languages. They have obvious applications to design, including for marketing. The infrastructure presented, together with the algorithm to which it gives support, the latter proposed in another, twin, paper, is a core component of a system, described in our past work, that allows users to build their own shape grammars and experiment with and use them.},

  abstract={A pattern classifier named Hash-based Associative Memory-like Pattern Classifier (HAPC) based on hashing technique, associative memory, and human deep-thinking logic is proposed in this paper to solve pattern classification problems without complicated mathematical computation. In the hashing layer of the designed system, one of the similarity-preserve hashing is used to convert the input samples to hashed data which dramatically reduces the dimensionality of the data but keeps the similarity information. In the clustering layer, hashed samples are divided into different clusters, which can be considered a feature extraction process based on the similarity of the hash value. In the associate memory layer, each cluster will be trained as an associate memory to store the hashed data stably. In the logical layer, Bayesian inference is used to perform the decision-making process to classify the testing sample without complicated mathematical computation.

  abstract={The aim of this article is to investigate the role of fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) and foresight techniques in supporting strategic foresight to reduce uncertainty in the field of Futures Studies. The combination of these approaches helps to better understand the future alternatives available to decision-makers by combining storytelling with trend extrapolation using a proposed new hybrid process called FLighTS (Future Lighthouse Trending Scenarios). Thus, in the process of determining the most appropriate future, it is possible to reduce the uncertainty due to vague and ambiguous value judgments in the process of inference of decision makers.The work presented in this article aims to improve the combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches to facilitate further exploration of the possibilities of a new non-linear way of thinking about the future. The article includes a conceptual model and an experimental example that develops a case for a higher education institution (HEI).The article ends with a reflection on conceptual modeling and suggests ways for use in future research.},

  abstract={Accurate recognition of the meaning of words in the given document fragments has a long historical standing in computational linguistics. Because of its importance in understanding natural language semantics, it becomes one of the most challenging issues within this field. In this paper, we present an enhanced knowledge-based word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithm that manipulates by calculating the semantic similarity between definitions of the target word and an extended syntactic context vector. The actual meaning of the target word is identified as that for which the semantic similarity between definition and extended syntactic context vector is highest. Therefore, while traditional WSD approaches are based on semantic information, our method is built on both semantic and syntactic relations between sentences. This allows it to take advantage of a better use of comprehensive knowledge and more in line with the human being way of thinking. For the sake of improving the performance of WSD, we combine the syntactic importance of the words within the original document piece to provide a sequence that can be used to decide which words should be disambiguated. Finally, the evaluation performed on two standard datasets shows that our algorithm goes better beyond the baselines and has more desirable features than other popular algorithms.},

  abstract={While most contemporary researchers argue that Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides overwhelming and profound advancements in technology and beneficial tools used daily to advance human life on earth, there exist a host of other researchers who hold contrary opinions to this view, with regard to the rising adverse ontological and existential consequences which the products of super-intelligent technologies has on an alarming number of mankind in the 21st century. Scholars like Vardi, Tegmark and Greene likened this scenario to a time-bomb waiting to go off any moment. The recent endorsement of 23 AI principles by 1200 AI/Robotics researchers and over 2342 other researchers from diverse disciplines, in a just concluded Future of Life (FLI) Conference, adds credence to the worries which most researchers have about the presumed benefits of AI to mankind. The study draws from a combination of Marxian Alienation and ontological theories which basically holds that: rising advancements in AI technologies, continues to alienate mankind from his existential human nature. The ex-post facto research design in the social sciences and Deriders' deconstructive and critical reconstructive analytic method in philosophy, for interrogating the meaning of concepts, arguments and current debates on the relevance and risks of IA, were adopted for the study. The study identified justifiable grounds and reasons for the alarm raised over current innovations in the field of AI technologies. The study strengthen the resolve of current researchers to identify ways of reducing or avoiding the impending adverse consequences of evolving conscious AI and machines in the feature. The research proposes a radical legal enforcement and adoption of the 23 newly established AI principles as one of the pertinent measure for saving mankind from the impending threats posed by innovations powered by advances in AI technology.},

  abstract={Human cognition stems from his identifying the relationship or relative distance between himself and any other objects or persons, for which prerequisite is establishing his 'self'. In other words, it is presumable that the potential of intelligent machine's establishing its 'self' would require us to engineer its sense of 'ego' and 'intention', which involves such factors as 'emotions', 'instincts', and 'sensibilities'. This dissertation introduces the psycho-quantum theory which illustrates the human psychodynamics by the quantum mechanics approach, and its application for constructing the distribution model of emotional modalities and the autonomous system, the essential elements for creating an ego in a computer. We have attempted to create the artificial 'ego' and 'desire' based on our probability model and state transition analysis, then accordingly developed our methodology of the artificial thought process as well as the judging mechanism of such computer. Furthermore, this dissertation introduces the sensibility inference function of our psycho-quantum computer, by which we discuss our methods to itemize 126 emotional modalities of human, construct the three-dimensional dynamic model of emotions, and analyze the emotion distribution and its longitudinal modal transition so as to derive the artificial instinct and to determine/infer its relationship with external factors. Currently, our technology to construct the comprehensive psycho-quantum computer is yet in developmental stage; however, its potential is enormous so that it will constitute a key technology in new robotics industry.},

  abstract={The surge of interest in artificial intelligence systems has sparked new directions of research in the realm of music data analysis. At the same time, the exploration and exploitation of intrinsic musical structures and sequences, a timeless endeavor, continue to captivate scholars and practitioners alike. In this context, the fusion of computational techniques with music analysis emerges as a natural progression. One of the pivotal crossroads in this convergence is the identification of musical phrase boundaries, pivotal demarcations that underpin the organizational fabric of a musical composition. This article pioneers an inventive approach to address the challenge of detecting these musical phrase boundaries, harnessing the power of artificial neural networks. However, the innovation does not stop there; the pinpointed phrase boundaries undergo a comprehensive dissection utilizing pattern mining techniques. The focus of this analysis is on unveiling recurrent motifs and classifying phrases into coherent clusters, predicated on the repetitions and similarities exposed through these neural network-driven techniques. This exploration was conducted using an extensive repository of folk songs, a treasure trove of foundational musical expressions that indelibly shape the stylistic contours of musical compositions. We claim that the presented approach not only opens avenues for penetrating and nuanced analysis, but also enriches our comprehension of the intricate interplay of musical components and their manifestations inspired by neural networks.},
