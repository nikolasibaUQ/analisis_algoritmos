  abstract={In this study the pair computational problem-solving between the student and ChatGPT was analyzed. The three university students who were experienced in using Python program in computational problem-solving participated in the study. In data collection, a problem involving “limit and sequence” from calculus was used to examine students' collaboration with ChatGPT. Students were asked to construct a program that produces a solution to this problem in Python, and meanwhile, it was stated that they could work in pairs with ChatGPT. The responses provided by ChatGPT to the students in the computational problem-solving were evaluated in both computational and mathematical contexts and a list of cases in which ChatGPT could and could not support students in the computational thinking practices was created. Aside from the incorrect or implicit answers provided by ChatGPT, in general, it was determined that ChatGPT supported the student's performance in computational thinking. It was deduced that it was important for the student to make a rational problem-solving plan and to guide the ChatGPT with the appropriate prompts in order to use rational questioning that leads to productive argumentation with ChatGPT.},

  abstract={Representing human knowledge plays an important role in artificial intelligence science. Nowadays, there are many effective methods for representing knowledge such as semantic networks, conceptual graphs, computational networks. Computational Objects Knowledge Base (COKB) can be used to represent knowledge in many kinds of knowledge domain, such as Linear Algebra, Analytic Geometry, Direct Current Electrical Circuits. However, COKB model cannot be used to represent knowledge and solve problems about chemical elements efficiently. In this paper, we propose a variation of COKB model called Che-COKB which is the useful tool to represent knowledge about chemical elements and solve some kinds of problems in this knowledge domain. Furthermore, the algorithms for solving problems on model have been built up. In addition, the proposed model and algorithms were also applied to construct an application for solving some problems about chemical elements on mobile devices.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={One important pedagogical approach is to motivate students actively learn and discover new knowledge by using contemporary instructional design methods. This is in sharp contrast to another approach that forces students to take a passive rote-learning strategy. To promote active learning, CityU Hong Kong adopted the so-called discovery-enriched curriculum (DEC) pedagogical approach to enhance student learning at the tertiary education setting. While various curriculum design and instructional methods have been explored in recent years, an effective way to assess students' novel discoveries and creativity remains a great challenge. This paper investigates into a relatively new text analytics computational approach to facilitate instructors of identifying and assessing the concrete evidences of students' achievements under a DEC-based pedagogical approach. In particular, we illustrate a topic modeling-based text mining method which can extract the hidden intents and creative ideas of students embedded in their project work. According to our best knowledge, this is one of the few successful research work of applying a topic modeling method to enhance the assessment of students' achievements under a DEC pedagogical approach. The practical application and implications of our work is that educational practitioners can apply the proposed computational method to facilitate the assessment of students' novel discoveries.},

  abstract={Processes in the mind: perception, cognition, concepts, instincts, emotions, and higher cognitive abilities for abstract thinking, beautiful music are considered here within a neural modeling fields (NMFs) paradigm. Its fundamental mathematical mechanism is a process ¿from vague-fuzzy to crisp,¿ called dynamic logic (DL). This paper discusses why this paradigm is necessary mathematically, and relates it to a psychological description of the mind. Surprisingly, the process from ¿vague to crisp¿ corresponds to Aristotelian understanding of mental functioning. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements confirmed this process in neural mechanisms of perception.},

  abstract={In view of the relatively backward situation of automation information technology in manufacturing enterprises, this paper analyzes the manufacturing process of industry, designs and constructs a HD_MAS (Hierarchical Distributed Multi-Agent Systems(MAS)) architecture for collaborative control of process industry process so as to achieve collaborative control optimization for the whole manufacturing process. Based on MAS technology, this paper constructs a collaborative control model for manufacturing system that integrates multiple production units. This model combines several intelligent modules and physical entities organically. Based on the cooperation between Multi-agents, the improved MADDPG (Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) algorithm is proposed. A new algorithm framework called DS_MADDPG (Distributed Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) is applied to this model. Through the cooperation of Multi-agents, a certain intelligent control system is formed so that it can accurately complete complex production tasks and achieve distributed collaborative control of the manufacturing process, which will drive manufacturing companies to transform into the smart manufacturing.},

  abstract={Involvement has become an important variable in consumer behavior and marketing research for a long time. The purpose of this study is to develop a model that can explain the complicated relationship between antecedents, consequences, and different types of involvement at the same time to understand the internal state of consumers better. Specifically, this model has to be capable of handling the vague interactions between different types of involvement. We develop this integrated model by the using of the intuitionistic fuzzy automata. We choose the cell phone as the stimulus product in this research. There are 19 antecedents, 5 types of involvement, and 10 consequences in the integrated involvement model. According to the results, we find that the intuitionistic fuzzy automata can deal with the interactions between different types of involvement. Second, the intuitionistic fuzzy automata can observe the relations between antecedents, consequences, and 5 types of involvement at the same time. Besides, we can observe the internal state inside consumers through the intuitionistic fuzzy automata, especially the degree of hesitation when they make decisions.},

  year={2022},
  volume={24},
  number={},
  pages={87-102},
  abstract={A large number of individuals are suffering from suicidal ideation in the world. There are a number of causes behind why an individual might suffer from suicidal ideation. As the most popular platform for self-expression, emotion release, and personal interaction, individuals may exhibit a number of symptoms of suicidal ideation on social media. Nevertheless, challenges from both data and knowledge aspects remain as obstacles, constraining the social media-based detection performance. Data implicitness and sparsity make it difficult to discover the inner true intentions of individuals based on their posts. Inspired by psychological studies, we build and unify a high-level suicide-oriented knowledge graph with deep neural networks for suicidal ideation detection on social media. We further design a two-layered attention mechanism to explicitly reason and establish key risk factors to individual&#x0027;s suicidal ideation. The performance study on microblog and Reddit shows that: 1) with the constructed personal knowledge graph, the social media-based suicidal ideation detection can achieve over 93&#x0025; accuracy; and 2) among the six categories of personal factors, <i>post, personality,</i> and <i>experience</i> are the top-3 key indicators. Under these categories, <i>posted text</i>, <i>stress level</i>, <i>stress duration</i>, <i>posted image</i>, and <i>ruminant thinking</i> contribute to one&#x0027;s suicidal ideation detection.},

  title={DeepStealth: Game-Based Learning Stealth Assessment With Deep Neural Networks}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={13},
  number={2},
  pages={312-325},
  abstract={A distinctive feature of game-based learning environments is their capacity for enabling stealth assessment. Stealth assessment analyzes a stream of fine-grained student interaction data from a game-based learning environment to dynamically draw inferences about students' competencies through evidence-centered design. In evidence-centered design, evidence models have been traditionally designed using statistical rules authored by domain experts that are encoded using Bayesian networks. This article presents DeepStealth, a deep learning-based stealth assessment framework, that yields significant reductions in the feature engineering labor that has previously been required to create stealth assessments. DeepStealth utilizes end-to-end trainable deep neural network-based evidence models. Using this framework, evidence models are devised using a set of predictive features captured from raw, low-level interaction data to infer evidence for competencies. We investigate two deep learning-based evidence models, long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and n-gram encoded feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). We compare these models' predictive performance for inferring students' knowledge to linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) and naïve Bayes models. We perform feature set-level analyses of game trace logs and external pre-learning measures, and we examine the models' early prediction capacity. The framework is evaluated using data collected from 182 middle school students interacting with a game-based learning environment for middle grade computational thinking. Results indicate that LSTM-based stealth assessors outperform competitive baseline approaches with respect to predictive accuracy and early prediction capacity. We find that LSTMs, FFNNs, and CRFs all benefit from combined feature sets derived from both game trace logs and external pre-learning measures.},

  abstract={Adaptive online learning can facilitate students' support by responding immediately to the user's interactions. Good feedback to students helps closing the gap between actual and desired performance. In this paper we analyze how to introduce online adaptive formative learning in Computer Science, a discipline with well documented challenges that are hard to tackle with traditional classroom methods. Specifically, we developed illustrative learning items teaching Model-Driven Design and implemented them in an online system that implements a model for automatic formative assessment developed by University of Torino. The model takes advantage of an automatic assessment system initially designed for STEM disciplines, then adopted for teaching languages and other disciplines too. The key features of the adaptive model supported by the online system are algorithmic questions, availability, contextualization, immediate feedback, interactive feedback, and open answers. These features are portable across subject domains, so the system can be adapted to include new subjects. We chose MDD because it is a topic of Computer Science education connected with Computational Thinking, software design, and formal methods, which are three of the core areas in need of enhanced support.},

The research was delineated with a methodology of action research, which made possible the evaluation of the Scratch language and the pseudocode at the end of the approach of each content. The steps of approaching each content were initiated with the application of the diagnostic evaluation, and finalized with the evaluation of performance. The results indicate that the use of the Scratch language presented better results during the initial stages; as the complexity of the content increased, the use of the pseudocode produced better results. Nevertheless, it is worth noting the good acceptance of the Scratch language for the teaching-learning process of the contents, as well as the contribution that it has had to the learning of logic and programming algorithms.},

  abstract={Automatic assessment of learner competencies is a fundamental task in intelligent tutoring systems. An assessment rubric typically and effectively describes relevant competencies and competence levels. This paper presents an approach to deriving a learner model directly from an assessment rubric defining some (partial) ordering of competence levels. The model is based on Bayesian networks and exploits logical gates with uncertainty (often referred to as noisy gates) to reduce the number of parameters of the model, so to simplify their elicitation by experts and allow real-time inference in intelligent tutoring systems. We illustrate how the approach can be applied to automatize the human assessment of an activity developed for testing computational thinking skills. The simple elicitation of the model starting from the assessment rubric opens up the possibility of quickly automating the assessment of several tasks, making them more easily exploitable in the context of adaptive assessment tools and intelligent tntorino systems.},

  abstract={Despite the enthusiasm and initiatives for making programming accessible to students outside Computer Science (CS), unfortunately, there are still many unanswered questions about how we should be teaching programming to engineers, scientists, artists or other non-CS majors. We present an in-depth case study of first-year management engineering students enrolled in a required introductory programming course at a large North American university. Based on an inductive analysis of one-on-one interviews, surveys, and weekly observations, we provide insights into students' motivations, career goals, perceptions of programming, and reactions to the Java and Processing languages. One of our key findings is that between the traditional classification of non-programmers vs. programmers, there exists a category of conversational programmers who do not necessarily want to be professional programmers or even end-user programmers, but want to learn programming so that they can speak in the “programmer's language” and improve their perceived job marketability in the software industry.},

In this work, we advocate the use of comics—a medium capable of presenting abstract ideas in a concrete, familiar way—for introducing programming concepts. Particularly, we propose a design process and related tools to help students and teachers create coding strips, a form of comic strips that are associated with a piece of code. We conducted two design workshops with students and high school computer science teachers to evaluate our design process and tools. We find that our design process and tools are effective at supporting the design of coding strips and that both students and teachers are excited about using coding strip as a tool for learning and teaching programming concepts.},

  abstract={In this paper, we propose that the data generated by educational robots can be better used by applying learning analytics methods and techniques which can lead to a deeper understanding of the learners' apprehension and behavior as well as refined guidelines for roboticists and improved interventions by the teachers. As a step towards this, we put forward analyzing behavior and task performance at team and/or individual levels by coupling robot data with the data from conventional methods of assessment through quizzes. Classifying learners/teams in the behavioral feature space with respect to the task performance gives insight into the behavior patterns relevant for high performance, which could be backed by feature ranking. As a use case, we present an open-ended learning activity using tangible haptic-enabled Cellulo robots in a classroom-level setting. The pilot study, spanning over approximately an hour, is conducted with 25 children in teams of two that are aged between 11-12. A linear separation is observed between the high and low performing teams where two of the behavioral features, namely number of distinct attempts and the visits to the destination, are found to be important. Although the pilot study in its current form has limitations, e.g. its low sample size, it contributes to highlighting the potential of the use of learning analytics in educational robotics.},

  abstract={Starting from our teaching experience and previous research on programming for non-technical university students in Japan and Denmark, we identify an unarticulated dependency of programming materials from other technical domains, which causes a knowledge domain mismatch in learners. We approach this mismatch on two fronts: by defining a novel way to structure beginners courses that moves away from the classic bottom-up approach based on math-related problems, and instead leverages on multimedia as a motivational and powerful general-purpose domain to ground programming and scaffold its understanding; and via the design and implementation of new Python library that simplifies multimedia programming. We are currently organizing tests of both multimedia library and the new course structure in Japan and Denmark.},

  abstract={In order to realize a cooperative supercomputing environment, Large-scale scientific simulation data should be exchanged among supercomputers over the internet. To maintain the interactivity of the time-series simulation in such an environment, real-time data compression is required. Given the accuracy requirements of scientific simulation, we only focus on lossless data compression. In this paper, we propose Think Mantissa as Integer method to decrease the entropy of scientific datasets, achieving a good compression ratio and speeds. We evaluate this scheme in two experiments and compare it with the existing compression strategies (gzip, bzip2). Our approach gets about a 30% improvement in the compression ratio and hundreds of times speed acceleration. We also computed the total time of the data transfer using this method under some specific bandwidth cases, and nearly all of them have gotten a good acceleration.},

  abstract={A reconstruction model of agile logistics was proposed in this paper, based on related agile and agile logistics research. At first, there was a short discussion about the agile logistics modular thinking and modular categories based on the operation of agile logistics processes, then the level of the customer service parameters and the functional modules of the logistics (transport, storage, distribution, package, etc) were analyzed by the antinomy relations between customer service and logistics cost, and then, the objective function of the reconstruction was identified. Secondly, the gray relational grade was used to acquire the result of decision-making result of the reconstruction model of agile logistics. At last, a real application was given for the model, calculated the gray relational grade and geted the best decision.},

  title={Empirical Evidence of the Usage of Programming Languages in the Educational Process},

  abstract={Contribution: A systematic literature review on the empirical evidence regarding the usage of programming languages for learning purposes is presented. The review analyzes different methods and tools at different educational levels and with different objectives. Background: Learning programming has gained relevance in the last decade. This is due to the massive presence of programmable elements ranging from computers to toys. Because of this, the interest of researchers on this topic has increased. Questions, such as what to use, in what educational stages to use it, the effectiveness of the method, and the focal objectives for learning programming are questions that do not have obvious answers. Research Questions: 1) What empirical evidence exists on the use of educational programming languages (EPLs)? 2) In what context is the research performed? 3) How is effectiveness reported in the literature after applying EPLs? 4) What pedagogical goals are achieved by using EPLs? Methodology: Following a formal protocol, automated searches were performed for primary studies from 2007 to 2018. A total of 62 studies were identified, of which 29 were selected and analyzed since they include some type of empirical evidence. Findings: After performing the evaluation, the results support the need for better approaches with empirical evidence when reporting research on the usage of EPLs. Some research opportunities are identified which concerns the used programming languages, the areas or stages of their application, or the need to have more empirical evidence in general and more studies in non-WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) contexts.},

  abstract={Creative problem solving model is a behavioral representation of users thinking, this kind of models helps to customize the user requirements to achieve a certain needs. Different studies have been reported the difficulties of learning in term of designing and developing a modern computer games applications which presents a complex activity by involving many participants from a variety of disciplines. Generally, developing a computer games is different from other types of software development because of video games include far more artistic content than other types of software systems, and there is many briers try to avoid other users or students who are willing to develop their own skills in this field. Hence, this research seeking for optimizing creative problem solving (CPS) model to help non programmers to learn how to design and develop computer games based framework. This research employed Virtools framework for providing an appropriate environment to design and develop computer games applications for non programmers.},
