  abstract={During the height of the CoViD-19 pandemic in 2020 and early 2021, schools throughout Europe have been closed for several months, leaving teachers with the responsibility of providing distance learning through video conferencing and remote-presence systems, while parents were scrambling for appropriate tools and support. School outings have also suffered from the limited mobility of students given by stay-at-home orders and other restrictions. In this paper we present a set of technologies developed to reproduce the school trip experience, allowing students to stay at home or in school and requiring only a Web browser and Internet access, while integrating communication tools that allow participants to actively be engaged in interactive lessons and educational experiences. In 2020 the tool has been used during the “CodyTrip” event, a two-day visit to the town of Urbino, attended by more than 15.000 students, followed up with a series of events in 2021 with over 115.000 participants. Results from the pilot events show very high engagement and demonstrate the feasibility of organizing online visiting experiences with massive participation without compromising the perceived interactivity of the proposed activities, which can be equally engaging for different audience demographics. Findings also suggest that this solution may be adopted not only as a contingent substitute for traveling during the pandemic, but as an effective tool to widen the scope and appeal of cultural tourism.},

  abstract={Computer programming courses are mandatory for many majors. However, the high rate of failures shows that students have difficulties in assimilating the topics. The objective of this research is to understand these difficulties. Analyzing diaries filled out by students and interviews with instructors, we identified difficulties related to language and understanding and some strategies used to mitigate them. The analysis and understanding of the difficulties may support the creation of teaching strategies and tools to facilitate the teaching and learning of computer programming.},

The first question that guided our research is how is the Pace University D.P.S. program related to other doctoral computing programs in the United States and globally. The second question that guided our inquiry is dissertation topics pursued by graduates in dissertation research, specifically by IT professionals in the Pace University program. To answer this second question, we analyzed the first 114 dissertation abstracts that have been defended at Pace University in the Seidenberg School of Computer Science and Information Systems. We used machine learning and natural language processing to determine commonalities among research topics in order to gain an understanding of the topic categories and topic spread produced by the program.},

  abstract={This study aims to explore educational methods for conceptual modeling for novices. The subjects of this study are primarily Grade 9 students in secondary school who are enrolled in compulsory education. This study relies heavily on model-driven development (MDD) and a domain-specific language (DSL). Using MDD, learners are not asked to write code, but rather to create a model to evaluate their model by observing the behavior of the target device. Teachers can control the difficulty of the problems assigned to their students by using a DSL. In this study, we describe our research approach using MDD and a DSL and then show our experiment design and results. We also discuss the qualitative and qualitative effectiveness of UML programming in Technology class for Grade 9 students.},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Computer science for all initiatives have broadened the participation of students enrolled in elective computer science (CS) courses and introduced compulsory CS instruction in many areas of the United States. However, there is a shortage of K-12 teachers with the background, preparation, and experience necessary to teach CS. To build capacity to deliver this instruction, districts must provide teacher preparation that includes not only CS content, but also high-quality pedagogical approaches that will meet the needs of all students enrolled in a wide variety of school settings. In this paper, we explore teacher outcomes across multiple CS professional development opportunities, in one large urban district. The teacher outcomes were measured via a survey administered between eight months and two years after teachers received training to implement CS. Though our findings are from a single district, we believe these findings are relevant to other settings and provide useful information about the outcomes of teacher professional development for CS education, as well as supports and barriers to implementing CS, in a large, urban school system. The results offer insight into professional development quality, teacher confidence, the ability of teachers to implement CS in their classrooms, and supports and barriers to offering CS instruction (even in a district where CS education is a priority). They also shed light on how supports and barriers differ in schools serving students with high economic needs and lower academic performance compared with schools serving students with lower economic needs and higher academic performance. These differences underscore the importance of considering economic need and academic performance (in addition to race and gender) when developing and executing CS for all initiatives.},

  abstract={Coding skills have become the new language of communication for the tech world. At an educational level, applying the concepts and logic of programming is a complex task for the student. The investigation of this problem was carried out with the intention of knowing if there are tools that could help the student understand programming by using augmented reality technology. For this purpose, a systematic mapping study was carried out to identify, filter and classify the information through a query applied in different ways of research. As a result, 34 articles were selected and classified. The main results show that: a) programming learning is not limited in terms of the student's age; b) Augmented reality has potential advantages in programming learning; c) Due to the extensive content of the programming, applications focused on specific topics were found according to the level of studies; d) The software used in the development of AR applications, mostly uses Unity with Vuforia; and, e) Augmented reality contributes to different learning techniques and styles that improve the way information is perceived and visualized. In conclusion, augmented reality technology has proven to have positive consequences in the programming learning process, providing a starting point for the development of a tool that contributes to the programming learning based on the characteristics found and analyzed in this document.},

  abstract={Worldwide we see an increasing focus on implementing STEM, CT and Educational Robotics, within K-12 curricula and the British BBC and the Danish DR, have provided more than one-million pupils with the micro:bit technology. However, research show that breadboards and circuit diagrams, can be difficult to understand. In this paper, we have evaluated a set of tools and materials - designed to support the teaching of electronics and CT, for use with micro:bits, breadboards and circuit diagrams - by integrating them in a case study of a robotics course for 7th grade primary school pupils (n=21). The tools and materials consist of 3D-printable covers designed to visualize the internal connections of a breadboard, and a new type of circuit diagrams, incorporating visual cues from the these, into their designs. Results show that the tools and materials ease the learning of the breadboard and of how to use and interpret circuit diagrams. Furthermore, the tools and materials, have been made available free of charge.},

  title={Developing a Real World Escape Room for Assessing Preexisting Debugging Experience of K12 Students}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={521-529},
  abstract={Debugging code is a central skill in learning to program. Nevertheless, debugging poses a major hurdle in the K12 classroom, as students are often rather helpless and rely on the teacher hurrying from one student-PC to the other. Despite this, debugging is an underrepresented topic in the classroom as well as in computer science education research, as only few studies, materials and concepts discuss the explicit teaching of debugging. According to the constructivist learning theory, teaching and developing concepts and materials for the classroom have to take learners' preexisting experience into account. Students' preexisting debugging experience is built through troubleshooting, where they frequently find and fix errors in their daily lives - before they learn to program - for example when repairing their bicycle or if “the internet” stops working. Debugging is a special case of general troubleshooting and shares common characteristics, such as the overall process or particular strategies. Thus, the aim of this study is to develop an instrument for assessing preexisting debugging experience in the form of a real-world escape room consisting of debugging-related troubleshooting tasks. This allows us to observe students' troubleshooting process, strategies, and overall behavior in a natural environment and thus assess preexisting debugging experience. To this end, a design-based research process was conducted and a real-world escape room consisting of various troubleshooting tasks was developed. Those tasks and the escape room setting provide an innovative methodological approach to study students troubleshooting behavior and assess their preexisting debugging experience.},

  abstract={The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought to the fore the need to educate students about AI. The aim is not to keep AI a black box and at the same time to be recognized as a transferable literacy with multiple learning benefits per age group of students. In order to strengthen this perspective, the design of workshops to introduce the basics of artificial intelligence to middle school students according to educational neuroscience principles is presented. With these workshops, the importance of AI literacy is emphasized, and students are given space for hands-on activities. The proposals are based on the axes of perception, representation and reasoning, learning, physical interaction, and social impact and include sections on Introduction to Machine Learning, Machine Learning Application Examples, Supervised Learning, and Training-Test Processes, Unsupervised Learning, and Machine Learning Algorithms.},

It utilizes virtualization to encourage group collaboration and grants anytime, anywhere access to the smart home facility. It incorporates dynamic binding capability that allows students to either use the sensors and actuators hardware they check out and install locally for development, or to conduct experiments in the smart home facility. Once the development is completed, the programs can be deployed remotely, and students can make observations through web cams strategically situated in the smart home facility and the logs of the system's operations and users' activities. The REACH platform is designed to support a large spectrum of computer science courses, from the equivalence of computer science lab 101, interdisciplinary projects, all the way to research projects in artificial intelligence, pervasive computing, and human computer interactions.},

  abstract={The original concept of space has emerged in Paleolithic times from the concept of orientation. Its appearance cannot be interpreted as a random event, but it must be seen as the result of considerable brainwork. Current operational structures of cognition appear rooted in prehistoric thought. Pictograms, ideograms and logograms signify fundamental steps for the later emergence of the linear writing and linear time as history and thought. Binary logic and elementary first order propositional calculus are an important aspect of language and seems to have little in common with the perception of objects in space. Nevertheless, we show that classical logic can be derived from the primeval concept of orientation that has emerged in human cognition during Paleolithic worship activity. From there, all higher thought structures can be developed. Thought is a neuronal filter for the perception of that which is. Understanding this deep layer of thought is vital to develop highly competitive, reliable and effective cognitive robot and brain-inspired system.},

  year={2021},
  volume={15},
  number={6},
  pages={1161-1173},
  abstract={With advances in circuit design and sensing technology, the acquisition of data from a large number of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors simultaneously to enable more accurate inferences has become mainstream. In this work, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the fusion of multimodal and multiresolution data obtained from several sensors. The proposed model enables the fusion of multiresolution sensor data, without having to resort to padding/ resampling to correct for frequency resolution differences even when carrying out temporal inferences like high-resolution event detection. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated for sleep apnea event detection, by fusing three different sensor signals obtained from UCD St. Vincent University Hospital&#x2019;s sleep apnea database. The proposed model is generalizable and this is demonstrated by incremental performance improvements, proportional to the number of sensors used for fusion. A selective dropout technique is used to prevent overfitting of the model to any specific high-resolution input, and increase the robustness of fusion to signal corruption from any sensor source. A fusion model with electrocardiogram (ECG), Peripheral oxygen saturation signal (SpO2), and abdominal movement signal achieved an accuracy of 99.72&#x0025; and a sensitivity of 98.98&#x0025;. Energy per classification of the proposed fusion model was estimated to be approximately 5.61 <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\mu$</tex-math></inline-formula>J for on-chip implementation. The feasibility of pruning to reduce the complexity of the fusion models was also studied.},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive neurological disorder that causes memory and thinking skill loss. Many different methods and algorithms have been applied to extract patterns from neuroimaging data in order to distinguish different stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the similarity of the brain patterns in older adults and in different stages makes the classification of different stages a challenge for researchers. In this paper, convolutional neuronal network architecture AlexNet was applied to fMRI datasets to classify different stages of the disease. We classified five different stages of Alzheimer's using a deep learning algorithm. The method successfully classified normal healthy control (NC), significant memory concern (SMC), early mild cognitive impair (EMCI), late cognitive mild impair (LMCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The model was implemented using GPU high performance computing. Before applying any classification, the fMRI data were strictly preprocessed. Then, low to high level features were extracted and learned using the AlexNet model. Our experiments show significant improvement in classification. The average accuracy of the model was 97.63%. We then tested our model on test datasets to evaluate the accuracy of the model per class, obtaining an accuracy of 94.97% for AD, 95.64% for EMCI, 95.89% for LMCI, 98.34% for NC, and 94.55% for SMC.},

  abstract={Enhancing student academic performance and transdisciplinary ability is challenging, but the time and effort put into accomplishing this ambitious feat is priceless. We develop secure privacy preserving across Personal Health Data (PHD) repository and single-cell genomics research for building an Innovative Systematic Pedagogy for Integrated Research - Education (INSPIRE) (http://americancse.org/events/csce2017/csce17_awards). In this paper we further build a novel, eclectic, and insightful framework based on classical and popular machine learning approaches to help us meet the educational challenge. Our framework focuses on using integrative research technologies to help solve “Education’s Performance Prediction Data Mining Crisis” (EPPDMC), by putting to rest issues associated with mining and making best use of big data for educational enhancement, such as multi-source education acquisition, data fusion, and unstructured data analysis. We exploit the uses of deep learning, text classification, and semi-supervised learning approaches to solve challenging problems that educators face when analyzing multiplatform big data involved in education, research and training students. Based on new machine learning approached we developed for genomic big-data research and in combination with machine learning methods (http://americancse.org/events/csce2017/keynotes_lectures/yang_talk) and the vast availability of education data available to us, not only can we utilize structured, unstructured, and even multi-media data, but while engaging in leaning intelligent thinking along the way, we can also maximize the utilization of big data by studying the motion and performance of these data. Hence we build the INSPIRE model that can further incorporate Student Face Expression in Class (SFEiC) to help educators and managers make further improvements as they become involved in the teaching-learning process. This research further facilitates the effectiveness of the INSPIRE model.},

  abstract={In an increasingly technological world, it is becoming more important to be able to fix equipment as it breaks down. In many places, it seems like companies do not focus on such abilities, whether it is through the design of the product, some form of warranty, or Digital Rights Management companies trying to get in the way of repairs. This trend may have been going on for longer than we think, with many companies seemingly changing focus at some point. Nevertheless, what are the benefits of device and product repair? Why not just throw out the broken product and buy a new one? In this paper, we will give a history of the right to repair and discuss how long the anti-repair engineering trend has gone on. We will also go into the potential costs and benefits of engineering with the right to repair in mind and the expenses that come with the current way companies operate. In the end, this paper should inform how, as a whole, the greater world could benefit from right to repair legislation and design. We also intend to cover the potential benefits of the right to repair for businesses that normally impede the right, in addition to the tangible benefits of applying Six Sigma to right to repair.},

  abstract={This article presents methods for correct decomposition for high performance computations related to large sets of graphs. These computations contain large number of calls of sequential, recursive algorithm for NP-complete problem - proper edge coloring of graph. Decomposition of this computational problem is not trivial, since the number of recursions in various parts of the computation is different and causes a high load and time imbalance. We designed, implemented and experimentally verified a new decomposition method that significantly reduces the computational time for a large set of graphs (up to 404 million graphs). This method ensures the same duration of computational time for partial subtasks and thus eliminates the need to wait for synchronization of parallel computations.},

  abstract={Summary form only given. Intelligence science is a cross-discipline that dedicates to joint research on basic theory and technology of intelligence by brain science, cognitive science, artificial intelligence and others. Brain science explores the essence of brain, research on the principle and model of natural intelligence in molecular, cell and behavior level. Cognitive science studies human mental activity, such as perception, learning, memory, thinking, consciousness etc. In order to implement machine intelligence, Artificial intelligence attempts simulation, extension and expansion of human intelligence using artificial methodology and technology. The above three disciplines work together to explore new concept, new theory, new methodology. It will be successful and create a brilliant future in the 21 century. Brain science points out that perceptive lobes have special function separately, the occipital lobe processes the visual information, the temporal lobe processes auditory information, the parietal lobe processes the information from the somatic sensors. All of three lobes deal with information perceived from the physical world. Each lobe is covered with cortex where the bodies of neurons are located. Cortex consists of primary, intermediate and advanced areas at least. Information is processed in the primary area first, then is passed to intermediate and advanced areas. Comparing with computer system, the brain is the same as hardware and the mind looks like software. Most work in cognitive science assumes that the mind has mental representations analogous to computer data structures, and computational procedures similar to computational algorithms. Connectionists have proposed novel ideas to use neurons and their connections as inspirations for data structures, and neuron firing and spreading activation as inspirations for algorithms. Cognitive science then works with a complex 3-way analogy among the mind, the brain, and computers. Mind, brain, and computation can each be used to suggest new ideas about the others. There is no single computational model of mind, since different kinds of computers and programming approaches suggest different ways in which the mind might work. The mind contains perception, rational, consciousness and emotion. The long-term scientific goal of artificial intelligence is human-level intelligence. In this lecture, we will discuss basic research topics related to intelligence science, such as learning, memory, thought, language, consciousness etc. We also report the recent progresses containing: visual perception; introspective learning; linguistic cognition; consciousness model; and platform of agent-grid intelligence},

  abstract={Through observation of a large number of numerical simulations in engineering application, we find that the resonance response calculation of traditional volume-surface integral equation (VSIE) method based on volume equivalence principle (VEP) is not accurate enough. We are used to thinking that this is because of the mismatch of normal component of electric fields on medium-metal interface. However, in this paper, through strict formula derivation, we proved that the normal boundary condition of electrical fields and the continuity equation of electric currents at the medium-metal interface are implicit in the solving process of VSIE with method of moment (MoM). We agree that not the normal component but the tangential component mismatch is responsible for the frequency deviation of VSIE simulation. Furthermore, the singularity treatment of Green's function with singular term extraction is also presented in this paper with strict deduction in special case of model discretization with quadrilateral and hexahedral elements, which would be quite useful for reducing the number of unknowns, improving the matrix condition and enhancing the accuracy for electromagnetic simulation in FSS (frequency selected surface) or IC (integrated circuits) applications.},

  abstract={Big data will bring revolutionary changes from life to thinking for society as a whole. At the same time, the massive data and potential value of big data are subject to many security risks. Aiming at the above problems, a data privacy protection model for big data platform is proposed. First, the data privacy protection model of big data for data owners is introduced in detail, including protocol design, logic design, complexity analysis and security analysis. Then, the query privacy protection model of big data for ordinary users is introduced in detail, including query protocol design and query mode design. Complexity analysis and safety analysis are performed. Finally, a stand-alone simulation experiment is built for the proposed privacy protection model. Experimental data is obtained and analyzed. The feasibility of the privacy protection model is verified.},

  abstract={Software as a Service (SaaS) has the potential to transform the way information-technology (IT) departments relate to and even think about their role as providers of computing services to the rest of the enterprise. The emergence of SaaS as an effective software-delivery mechanism creates an opportunity for IT departments to change their focus from deploying and supporting applications to managing the services that those applications provide. A successful service centric IT, in turn, directly produces more value for the business by providing services that draw from both internal and external sources and align closely with business goals. Despite the promised benefits of cloud computing and software as a service (SaaS) -- greater flexibility and scalability, infrastructure cost avoidance, "anywhere access" to applications and data -- concerns about security and governance have made some organizations hesitant to turn over a chunk of their IT systems to a third-party service provider.},

  abstract={In the stage of schematic design, some data needed to calculate design cooling load can not be supplied with accurate values, designers have to assess a value according to their experience only. The calculation of a building's design cooling load is different from the load analysis of existing buildings, it is a prediction of the maximum possible load of a future building when it is put into use, so it has the characteristic of uncertainty and prediction. In order to improve calculation efficiency and enhance accuracy, expert system technology is introduced and incorporated with a load index assessment method. Consequently, an expert system for the calculation of a building's design cooling load is established on the basis of artificial neural network theories. Application examples indicate that this system is simple and workable; the calculation results thereof achieve high accuracy, and calculation methods are in conformity to the thinking habits of designers.},
