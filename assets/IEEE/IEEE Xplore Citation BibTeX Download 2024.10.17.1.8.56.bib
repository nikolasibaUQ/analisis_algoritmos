  abstract={In this study, working with the task of object retrieval in clutter, we have developed a robot learning framework in which Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is first applied to enable a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to learn the intricate interactions between a robot arm and a complex scene containing many objects, allowing the DNN to partially clone the behavior of MCTS. In turn, the trained DNN is integrated into MCTS to help guide its search effort. We call this approach learning-guided Monte Carlo tree search for Object REtrieval (MORE), which delivers significant computational efficiency gains and added solution optimality. MORE is a self-supervised robotics framework/pipeline capable of working in the real world that successfully embodies the System 2 → System 1 learning philosophy proposed by Kahneman, where learned knowledge, used properly, can help greatly speed up a time-consuming decision process over time.

  abstract={Game designers can use computer-aided game design methods to model how players may experience the perceived difficulty of a game. We present methods to generate and analyze the difficulty of a wide variety of minimal action game variants throughout game space, where each point in this abstract design space represents a unique game variant. Focusing on a parameterized version of Flappy Bird, we predict hazard rates and difficulty curves using automatic playtesting, Monte Carlo simulation, a player model based on human motor skills (precision and actions per second), and survival analysis of score histograms. We demonstrate our techniques using simulated game play and actual game data from over 106 million play sessions of a popular online Flappy Bird variant, showing quantitative reasons why balancing a game for a wide range of player skill can be difficult. Some applications of our techniques include searching for a specific difficulty, game space visualization, computational creativity to find unique variants, and tuning game balance to adjust the difficulty curve even when game parameters are time varying, score dependent, or changing based on game progress.},

  pages={456-481},
  abstract={This paper presents a general problem-solving method combining the principles of artificial intelligence and evolutionary computation. The problem-solving method is based on the computer language GENETICA, which stands for "Genetic Evolution of Novel Entities Through the Interpretation of Composite Abstractions." GENETICAs programming environment includes a computational system that evolves data abstractions, viewed as genotypes of data generation scenarios for a GENETICA program, with respect to either confirmation or optimization goals. A problem can be formulated as a GENETICA program, while the solution is represented as a data structure resulting from an evolved data generation scenario. This approach to problem solving offers: 1) generality, since it concerns virtually any problem stated in formal logic; 2) effectiveness, since formally expressed problem-solving knowledge can be incorporated in the problem statement; and 3) creativity, since unpredictable solutions can be obtained by evolved data structures. It is shown that domain specific languages, including genetic programming ones, that inherit GENETICAs features can be developed in GENETICA. The language G-CAD, specialized to problem solving in the domain of architectural design, is presented as a case study followed by experimental results.},

  abstract={Advancing technology nodes have increased the impact of lithography variation on design yield and performance. Although lithographic distortion is emerging as the dominant mode of failure, particulate defect still remains an important source of defect. In this work, we present a novel critical area analysis technique that deals with non-deterministic line edges that arise due to statistical lithography variations. Previous critical area analysis techniques are based on fixed printed structures with variable defect sizes. The proposed solution integrates lithographic variations within critical area analysis, using available tools while keeping the computational complexity in check. The key optimizations include weighted stratified sampling of important lithographic parameters and Monte Carlo based Probability of Failure (POF) calculation that is scalable to large chips. Simulation results on ISCAS benchmarks show that inclusion of lithography induced physical variations can increase critical area by as much as 2X, while overall yield due to particulate defects in large designs may decrease by more than 5%; validating both the need for an integrated solution and its feasibility on large designs.},

  year={2015},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Most models of thought are based on the idea of associative memory: The combination of distinct concepts through their association with each other based on experience. Thus, the pattern of associations in the mind is thought to be a critical factor in determining the ideas - both familiar and unfamiliar - that thought can generate. The Itinerant Dynamics with Emergent Attractors (IDEA) model has been proposed as a computational representation of the process by which ideas might emerge in an associative memory system. However, the effect of how “association” is defined in this context remains an important unexplored issue. In this paper, we consider three different ways of defining associations between concepts based on their joint usage in texts, and show that these lead to very different dynamics in the process of emergent conceptual combinations. We use data from two real-world text corpora to instantiate the model: The collected poems of Dylan Thomas, and the Memoirs of the economist Ludwig von Mises. The two sources differ greatly in the nature of their content as well as the statistics of their word usage, which makes them interesting subjects for comparison.},

  number={},
  pages={207-214},
  abstract={While K-12 STEM Education test scores have been steadily improving over the past decade in the United States, achievement gaps still remain among minorities and women in STEM courses and careers. There are numerous factors that contribute to these disparities, such as poverty, low status and other sociocultural factors in classrooms that impede learning. Difficulties in STEM Education engagement and encumbered participation are often due to decontextualized learning - incongruence between meaningful contexts and learning processes. Game based learning methods are common STEM Ed models that provide youth with extrinsically motivating knowledge frameworks for learning, however, research has proven that even these procedural spaces often are disconnected from students' social and cultural realities. Amidst the STEM Ed achievement gaps problematic are similar disparities found in popular video game spaces, where there is a less than 20% chance that these same disparity groups will navigate computational worlds with protagonists that look like them. These gamers/students are lacking the “under-the-hood” (STEM) knowledge of the very games they engage with on a daily basis. This contradiction is central to this paper and the conceptualization of Metatuning - a game design pedagogical framework that aims to empower students to discover their identities as agents of change, and to see that game design can nurture their internal motivations. In this case study, Metatuning was used to foster an intrinsically motivated learning environment, where a young designer was able to iteratively design a social justice themed game that empowered her as a designer and an aspiring doctor.},

  abstract={Examples are useful for inspiring ideas and facilitating implementation in visualization design. However, there is little understanding of how visualization designers use examples, and how computational tools may support such activities. In this paper, we contribute an exploratory study of current practices in incorporating visualization examples. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 university students and 15 professional designers. Our analysis focus on two core design activities: searching for examples and utilizing examples. We characterize observed strategies and tools for performing these activities, as well as major challenges that hinder designers' current workflows. In addition, we identify themes that cut across these two activities: criteria for determining example usefulness, curation practices, and design fixation. Given our findings, we discuss the implications for visualization design and authoring tools and highlight critical areas for future research.},

  pages={740-753},
  abstract={Promoting creativity is considered an important goal of education, but creativity is notoriously hard to measure. In this article, we make the journey from defining a formal measure of creativity, that is, efficiently computable to applying the measure in a practical domain. The measure is general and relies on core theoretical concepts in creativity theory, namely fluency, flexibility, and originality, integrating with prior cognitive science literature. We adapted the general measure for projects in the popular visual programming language Scratch. We designed a machine learning model for predicting the creativity of Scratch projects, trained and evaluated on human expert creativity assessments in an extensive user study. Our results show that opinions about creativity in Scratch varied widely across experts. The automatic creativity assessment aligned with the assessment of the human experts more than the experts agreed with each other. This is a first step in providing computational models for measuring creativity that can be applied to educational technologies, and to scale up the benefit of creativity education in schools.},

This K-12 education initiative ran for 4 years (2015-2019), formed a learning community based on creativity, innovation and digital skills enhancement and collaborated with researchers, professionals, scientists who contributed voluntarily in the Club’s projects. This paper presents the experiences gained and the lessons learned during this four-year period and throws light on the role of a potential Coding Club founder. The results of this learning path, indicate that a Coding Club is an inclusive after-school programme that can function as an umbrella for innovative activities like programming, educational robotics, STEM, STEAM and ESTEAM (Entrepreneurship – Science – Technology – Engineering – Art – Mathematics).},

  pages={13-21},
  abstract={The understanding, framing, and support of learning, working, communicating, and collaborating is media-dependent: tools, materials, and social arrangements have always been involved in defining and conceptualizing these activities. Historically the emphasis has been to educate and support individual “Renaissance scholars”. In today's world, most of the significant problems are systemic problems that transcend not only the individual human mind but cannot be addressed by any one specialty discipline. To cope with these problems requires not only “Renaissance Scholars” but “Renaissance Communities” in which stakeholders coming from different disciplines can collaborate. Our research at the Center for Lifelong Learning & Design (L3D) over the past two decades has been focused on creating a new understanding of learning, new media, and new learning organizations. Our co-evolutionary perspective explores the dialectical relationship between: (1) how a deep understanding of learning creates innovative demands and design criteria for future generations of social-technical environments; (2) how the unique potential of computational media impacts and transforms learning by transcending "giftwrapping" and “technology-centered” approaches; and (3) how new learning organizations contribute to reconceptualizing and reinventing learning and education in the 21st century. The conceptual framework is illustrated by specific developments of social-technical environments that we have designed and evaluated including: collaborative, domain-oriented design environments, environments created by mass collaboration, and courses-as-seeds.},

  abstract={The expansion of computer science (CS) education in K-12 and higher-education in the United States has prompted deeper engagement with equity that moves beyond inclusion toward a more critical CS education. Rather than frame computing as a value-neutral tool, a justice-centered approach to equitable CS education draws on critical pedagogy to ensure the rightful presence of political struggles by emphasizing the development of not only knowledge and skills but also CS disciplinary identities. While recent efforts have integrated ethics into several areas of the undergraduate CS curriculum, critical approaches for teaching data structures and algorithms in particular are undertheorized. Basic Data Structures remains focused on runtime-centered algorithm analysis. We argue for affordance analysis, a more critical algorithm analysis based on an affordance account of value embedding. Drawing on critical methods from science and technology studies, philosophy of technology, and human-computer interaction, affordance analysis examines how the design of computational abstractions such as data structures and algorithms embody affordances, which in turn embody values with political consequences. We illustrate 5 case studies of how affordance analysis refutes social determination of technology, foregrounds the limitations of data abstractions, and implicates the design of algorithms in disproportionately distributing benefits and harms to particular social identities within the matrix of domination.},

  abstract={Color psychology is the study of the effect of colors on human behavior. This area of study is interesting and challenging because there is no simple “one-size-fits all” mapping between a color and the message that color can evoke in a particular person. Nevertheless, many of our daily decisions are influenced by the color palettes being presented to us. In this paper, we propose a novel computational algorithm to create color palettes that convey certain messages. It starts by constructing a weighted graph of color categories and messages that are based on semantic similarities between vector representation of the messages and delta-E color similarities between colors. The color selection process for a given message includes applying a Personalized PageRank algorithm on the graph, treating the message nodes as the personalizing factors. As a result, we have a distribution of probabilities over all the color nodes that have higher probabilities for the nodes neighboring to given messages. Finally, palettes are ranked on the basis of visual aesthetics, novelty, and the conflicting/reinforcing messages they evoke. We have applied this work to several interesting use cases where artists and fashion designers used the resulting color palettes to assist their creation process.},

  abstract={Earth satellite networks are playing an increasingly important role in observation, surveillance and reconnaissance of specific targets or areas with dramatic growing of the demand for such services. The harsh and vulnerable space environment makes satellite nodes susceptible to a variety of attacks and prompts us to protect satellite networks by securing them with efficient defending strategy. In this paper, we propose a satellite scheduling problem in a vulnerable space environment. A set of complex operational constraints is imposed to make the best defending strategy between task requests and satellites under protection. To reduce the complexity, we decompose the original problem into two subproblems of satellite scheduling and satellite protection. A joint optimization algorithm is adopted to find near optimal solution. The results of extensive computational experiments show its effective and superior scheduling performance.},

We have adapted the EarSketch curriculum to satisfy the requirements of an undergraduate level introductory programming course. We have deployed the curriculum at Georgia Gwinnett College starting in Spring 2016 with the goal of observing improvements in content knowledge and attitudes towards computing.

  abstract={Whether the central nervous system of primates uses a body-centered or an eye-centered frame for reaching is still a controversial debate in neurosciences. Does the proprioceptive information allow to represent the visual information with respect to the body or inversely, does it transform the hand position in retinal coordinates? In this paper, we implement and test two control schemes associated to each of these two hypotheses by using a computational approach from robotics. To this end, biological models of motor control are applied to a realistic dynamic model of upper body including a 4 DOF eye-neck kinematic chain and a 6DOF arm. Important characteristics, such as proprioceptive biases and sensory delay, are considered. Simulation results allow to compare the geometry of trajectories and illustrate the better robustness of the eye-centered control scheme with respect to biases and sensory delay. Applications to the control of the humanoid robot HRP2 are finally presented.},

They also continually simplify or speed up solutions to previous problems. We report on results of first experiments with POWERPLAY. A self-delimiting recurrent neural network (SLIM RNN) is used as a general computational architecture to implement the system's solver. Its weights can encode arbitrary, self-delimiting, halting or non-halting programs affecting both environment (through effectors) and internal states encoding abstractions of event sequences. In open-ended fashion, our POWERPLAY-driven RNNs learn to become increasingly general problem solvers, continually adding new problem solving procedures to the growing repertoire, exhibiting interesting developmental stages.},

  abstract={The prime focus on the deliberations related to Industry 5.0 lies in creativity, efficiency and resilience for adapting various organic components such as accurate decisions, customized demands in consumer electronics with promising/sustainable solutions. This transformation and paradigm shift inside the Industry 5.0 frame can be comprehensively understood by integrating the factors related to human values with the cutting-edge technologies of consumer electronics for compatibility with the issue of sustainable development. The present work proposes an integrated approach for extensive study with a set of criteria and possible Industry 5.0 enablers in consumer electronics using a novel decision-making approach. The approach comprises of  $T$ -spherical fuzzy information containment/processing through an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and then utilizing the weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) sequentially to obtain the necessary weights of selected criteria. Further, the obtained weights from AHP would be used in WASPAS for the computational assessment while finding the prioritization/ranking of industry 5.0 enablers. The results with the sensitivity analysis validate the robustness-cum-resilience of the proposed integrated approach with standard managerial implications and the findings take care of cognitive in the human socio-technical environment. The regulated adoption of Industry 5.0 enablers would help consumer electronics manufacturers in finding optimized solutions.},

  abstract={A computational aesthetics model developed for the game of international chess showed a good and positive correlation with human player aesthetic assessment. The unique approach taken here suggests that, in addition to things like personal taste and environmental factors, humans also likely assess beauty based on `universal metrics' within the domain itself. From the standpoint of artificial intelligence (AI), this means that weights for aesthetic features need not, for example, be determined by analyzing a particular data set of aesthetically-rated objects, or through consultation with human experts. Instead, certain metrics can be used as `building blocks' to formalize aesthetic principles or features in a logical and dynamic way. This is arguably an improvement over existing methods. The aesthetics model developed is explained and relevant experimental results are presented. The importance of universal metrics in the aesthetics of chess and other domains is also explored.},

  abstract={In this research full paper, we examine students’ improvement in spatial visualization skills when using MYR (short for "My Reality"), a browser-based, cloud-hosted programming environment for beginning through advanced programmers to create immersive, three-dimensional virtual reality scenes.The research literature suggests that there is correlation between students’ spatial abilities and their success in programming. In this study, we conducted a three-week (six hour) virtual after-school program which introduced high school students with different programming backgrounds to coding in MYR. During the program, students learned the basics of MYR, introductory CS topics, and completed individual coding projects, creating an original MYR scene.A study examined changes in students’ spatial reasoning as a result of this intervention. The students’ performance in spatial skills was measured using the Revised Purdue Spatial Visualization Test: Visualization of Rotations (Revised PSVT:R) [1]. Students completed this instrument using a pre/post survey design. We analyzed the impact of the intervention using a paired samples T-test. We further developed a rubric for analyzing the sophistication of students’ MYR code and applied it to evaluating the programming expertise of our study participants.The program was hosted twice with two different groups of high school students. Most showed interest in MYR programming and expressed their creativity and learned skills in their original project. With the first group of students, we found increases in their spatial visualization performance after the intervention with MYR, though statistical significance was not reached. The second group of students had higher baseline prior experience in computing and spatial visualization skills; these students did not further increase in their spatial visualization skill.The analysis showed that the MYR has a potential to improve spatial skills and engage students’ interest in computing. We recommend that MYR and related computational environments be further studied and made available to students.},

  abstract={In order to analyze Electrocardiograms (ECGs) in real time, this research is the first to integrate Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) into a cloud-based healthcare system. By utilizing sophisticated computational algorithms and an interpretivist perspective, the research seeks to transform cardiac diagnosis. Though extremely useful, traditional ECG analysis techniques have processing speed as well as scalability issues. The suggested method instantaneously interprets ECG waveforms by utilizing RNNs' temporal modeling capabilities. This paradigm change makes it possible to identify cardiac problems in a timely manner, potentially improving patient outcomes. Setting up a scalable cloud system for effective data processing is part of the study methodology. The RNN model is trained, verified, and then incorporated into the cloud system using secondary ECG data. The system's efficacy is confirmed by performance evaluation criteria like processing speed, sensitivity, and accuracy. Scalability, safety of data, and interpretability issues in models are highlighted via critical analysis. Techniques for improved model openness, strict data protection policies, and thorough scalability testing are all included in the recommendations.},
