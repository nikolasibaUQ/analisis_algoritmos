  abstract={Conceptual architecture involves a highly creative exploration of novel ideas, often taken from other disciplines as architects consider radical new forms, materials, textures and colors for buildings. While today's generative AI systems can produce remarkable results, they lack the creativity demonstrated for decades by evolutionary algorithms. SCAPE, our proposed tool, combines evolutionary search with generative AI, enabling users to explore creative and good quality designs inspired by their initial input through a simple point and click interface. SCAPE injects randomness into generative AI, and enables memory, making use of the built-in language skills of GPT -4 to vary prompts via text-based mutation and crossover. We demonstrate that compared to DALL. E 3, SCAPE enables a 67% improvement in image novelty, plus improvements in quality and effectiveness of use; we show that in just three iterations SCAPE has a 24% image novelty increase enabling effective exploration, plus optimization of images by users. We use more than 20 independent architects to assess SCAPE, who provide markedly positive feedback.},

  abstract={At this stage of development of science in the world raises the question of new methods for solving optimisation and a large number of applications, i.e. the creation of innovative solutions. This article analyses the state of science in the direction of innovation solutions for different problems. In scope of the article the possibility of creative computing and type-variety principle in different fields of knowledge is described with the review of literature. The goal is to obtain new results with higher quality while combining those two knowledges. Universality of diversity concept, described type-variety principle, understanding it as a tool for creating a new way for solving problems (as a tool for the formation innovation solutions) and the breadth of its application provide a basis to identify and define it as the fundamental principle of contemporary applied systems analysis. Type-variety principle explains the importance of various interdisciplinary levels and appears to be the root and active source of solution innovations.},

  title={Detection of Latent Gender Biases in Data and Models Using the Approximate Generalized Inverse Method}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={191-196},
  abstract={Gender bias creates inequalities in roles, expectations, and opportunities between males and females. When such biases are incorporated into artificial intelligence models, the corresponding technological solutions and products can further entrench the social biases. Herein, a new method for investigating the extent to which latent biases in text-based training data affect a language model is presented. Potential gender bias is identified by deriving values assigned to male/female words via inverse operations from embedded expressions to the original words using the approximate inverse model explanation (AIME). In particular, AIME constructs approximate generalized inverse operators for black-box models. A biased embedded representation used in machine learning models as an internal representation of word/sentence vectors likely introduces bias into the overall prediction results of such models. The OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 large language model, which provides embedded expressions, is employed to determine the gender bias included in the proposed method. Experimental results show that the OpenAI textembedding-ada-002 model is partially gender-biased owing to the training text data. These results are expected to (i) contribute to the development of effective measures preventing gender bias during the design and training of language models, (ii) promote the identification and mitigation of gender bias in future language models, and (iii) provide insights into the effect of language models and their limitations from technical, social, and cultural perspectives.},

  title={Modeling Emotion-Focused Coping as a Decision Process}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={People experience many stressful, emotion-evoking situations in everyday life. How they cope with these situations is crucial to their well-being. Research shows that people may change their beliefs to perceive the situations in a better, less-stressful light. Therefore, understanding how people change their beliefs to cope with stress and emotion is an important research question. Toward that end, we model coping, based on Lazarus's appraisal theory of emotion, as a two-step decision problem. However, people do not hallucinate arbitrary alternative realities in order to reduce stress. So a central challenge here is to model the constraints on belief change. We specifically stipulate two key factors influencing the degree of belief change: the utility of holding the alternative belief and constraints on changing a belief based on its underlying uncertainty. To investigate these factors and the model's assumptions, we applied the model to a simple hurricane situation and conducted an experiment based on this situation, where participants observed hurricane information and reported their beliefs about it. We found that when the hurricane worsens, those who stayed believe the hurricane to be less severe than the most likely outcome from the information and those who evacuated. The results also show that the uncertainty of information and the utility of the beliefs about that information is related and together determine how emotion-focused coping alters the person's beliefs. Overall, the results support the assumptions and predictions of the model. These findings illustrate the relevance of applying a decision-making model analysis to coping.},

  pages={319-325},
  abstract={In the era of "Internet plus Education", precise ideological and political education is a key subject for higher education and an important indicator of contemporary college students’ education evaluation. The precise evaluation of ideological and political education focuses on the multi-source collection of teaching evidence throughout the entire process, emphasizing the multidimensional evaluation and measurement of the teaching process and its effectiveness, and providing new ideas for learning evaluation. This article draws on the ideas of teaching evaluation and combines the characteristics of the integration of online and offline precise ideological and political education. From the process of "individual student modeling learning value precise ideological and political evaluation", a multi-source data representation model is established; A multi-source data fusion method for precise evaluation of ideological and political education has been established from three levels: behavior, cognition, and communication; Furthermore, a multi-source data fusion evaluation system based on Kalman filtering algorithm was proposed, which includes four stages: data acquisition, data association, data fusion, interpretation, and decision-making. Through empirical research, it has been found that in a precise ideological and political evaluation system, multi-source data from online teaching platform logs, classroom teaching videos, learning performance and effectiveness can accurately evaluate the types and performance of students’ ideological and political learning engagement, and have a good prediction of the status of ideological and political learning engagement.},

  abstract={New demands for Computer Science education arise in response to changing models of computing provision, in which earlier models of computing `as a product' are being superseded by models of computing `as a service'. Typical names for this shift are service-oriented computing or services computing. Both academic and industry sectors of computing are reacting to this trend in differing ways. This article provides an insight into the development of an undergraduate major in service science and a masters programme in service-oriented computing at the AUT University in Auckland, New Zealand, and an overview of the service computing offerings in the New Zealand market. We also provide an insight into the considerations that take place in developing new university programmes, the unique dialog that is part of a university programme approval process in New Zealand and the arguments our proposal received from other universities. We will also compare how these programmes relate to the proposed curriculum reference models for Service Computing. This in turn has lead to the establishment of a specialist Service Science Innovation Research group.},

  abstract={This study analyzes the process of online pedagogical mediation in a Distance Education undergraduate Pedagogy course based on the students’ perception of the learning experience in a virtual learning environment (VLE). Online pedagogical mediation is understood in this study as an educational and communicational process that aims at collective and collaborative construction of knowledge involving multiple mediators (human and non-human). To analyze this process, the community of inquiry (CoI) theoretical model played a central role in our study, especially in the interaction between online pedagogical mediation and the elements that constitute this model, considered interdependent and crucial for a successful higher educational experience: teaching presence, social presence, and cognitive presence. Data was collected with a questionnaire survey, which allowed us to identify the student’s conception of online pedagogical mediation and to assess the perception on the development of the presences of the CoI model in the pedagogical mediation used in the course VLE. The results suggest that most students share the perception that online pedagogical mediation is related to the role played by teachers and tutors. Regarding student’s perception of the learning experience, the results show that they positively perceive the development of the presences of the model, while also suggesting aspects of the online pedagogical mediation process that can be improved, aiming at the constitution of a community of inquiry more focused and effective in the development of learning.},

Thus, in the most recent years, a few information-driven methodologies have been proposed to survey the believability of client created content diffused through online life as on-line audits. Particular methodologies frequently think about various subsets of qualities, i.e., highlights, associated with the two audits and commentators, just as to the system structure connecting unmistakable elements on the survey site in test. This work goes for giving an examination of the fundamental audit and commentator driven highlights that have been proposed up to now in the writing to identify counterfeit surveys, specifically from those methodologies that utilize directed AI systems.

  title={New Life in Dusty Decks: Results of Porting a CM Fortran Based Aeroacoustic Model to High Performance Fortran}, 
  year={1997},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={16-16},
  abstract={The High Performance Fortran language is a 'standard by consensus', developed by individuals and vendors in the high performance computing industry, to provide a low barrier entry to parallel computing. It promises to be an easier to use development environment for distributed memory computing platforms compared to the programming complexity required by message passing libraries such as PVM and MPI. HPF promises much and is still in its infancy. Since HPF was developed in part based on experiences gained with early parallel Fortran compilers such as Thinking Machines CM Fortran, we decided to test the effectiveness of HPF with today's generation of HPF compilers by porting a complex existing model code originally developed using CM Fortran. The model code that we selected is a hybrid computational aeroacoustics code that solves the 3D, time-dependent Euler equations in the near flow field and uses a moving surface Kirchhoff's formula to predict the far field sound radiating from turbofan engine inlets. The original CM Fortran model code was developed on a Thinking Machines CM5. The extensive production research use of this model, using varying grid sizes, provides excellent benchmarks with which to compare the HPF port. Two HPF compilers were selected in the porting effort -- The Portland Group's (PGI) pghpf and the xlhpf compiler from IBM. IBM's xlhpf does not implement some elements of the HPF subset while PGI's offering provides several full-HPF extensions. porting efforts using each compiler exposed the strengths and weaknesses of each. Porting this complex code exposed many of the growing pains associated with the current generation of compilers. Critical sections of the code will be explained and these critical areas of the conversion effort will be discussed. Where necessary we will demonstrate how different porting strategies affected the performance of the code. Finally we will present how the ported code ran, using a varying number of processors, on an IBM SP2 and an SGI Origin 2000. While the current simple port does not match the speed of a CM-5, we hope further porting efforts and improved compiler technology will enable us to eventually match and then surpass CM-5 performance levels. With the shutdown of the NCSA CM-5 and the eventual removal and failure of the remaining Thinking Machines hardware currently installed, this effort will demonstrate that investments in CM Fortran code need not be abandoned and that new life can be breathed into those dusty decks.},

IoT has been studied extensively across many disciplines such as the networking, communication, security, business, and management communities. However, many unsolved challenges, especially in managing heterogeneous IoTs, remain to be discussed. Recent studies propose using blockchain, an emerging technology that enables decentralized coordination, to address inherent challenges in IoT. This article presents a preliminary study on an architecture that implements blockchain in managing heterogeneous IoT systems. We start by pointing out the limitations of prior IoT systems and the difficulties of integrating IoT and blockchain. Then we outline an architecture to manage a large-scale heterogeneous IoT system.

The results show that the proposed method preserves format compliance of the H.264/AVC and has a low impact on the compression ratio. It is secure and very efficient. Moreover it can be realized in real time application. The metrics used to evaluate our scheme are Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) and the Encryption Rate (ER).

  abstract={The development of adequate security solutions and in particular of authentication and authorization techniques for grid computing systems is a challenging task. Challenges arise from the heterogeneity of users, the presence of multiple security administration entities, the heterogeneity of security techniques used at the various grid hosts, the scalability requirements, and the need for high-level policies concerning resource sharing. Recent trends, like accessing grid through science gateways and the use of virtual organizations (VO) for managing user communities, further complicate the problem of security for grid computing systems. Currently, the GSI component developed as part of the Globus Toolkit, the de-facto standard for grid infrastructures is not fully suited to meet those challenges. The main drawback of such an approach is that it relies on a low level identity-based authorization scheme. .A low-level access control policy maps a user's identity (distinguished name) to a local account. Such approach does not scale and does not address many of the outlined requirements. We thus need security solutions that go beyond the simple solutions currently in use. The goal of this paper is to make a first step towards such solutions. The paper discusses and analyzes authentication and authorization solutions that better fit novel grid infrastructures characterized by virtual organizations and science gateways. Some of these solutions derive from ongoing work in current grid infrastructure projects; others are new proposals that we think worthy of discussion. In particular, we analyze the solutions proposed as part of the GridShib and the VO Privilege projects},

Therefore, the pedestrian detection has been a challenging problems and a hot research topic in computer vision. In order to improve the detection speed and guarantee the detection accuracy, this paper proposed a pedestrian detection algorithm based on multi-feature cascade. The algorithm has two important points. The one, using the improved HOG feature to quickly eliminate negative samples to improve the detection speed. The other, using the cascade structure to guarantee the detection accuracy. In this paper, the experiment proves that the algorithm indeed improves the detection speed obviously, and prove that the algorithm is indeed effective in the improvement of these two important points. The algorithm is a research result which is obtained through study some classical pedestrian detection algorithms.

  volume={30},

  pages={1102-1113},
  abstract={Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) is an extension of the intuitionistic fuzzy set. It has a wider space of membership degrees. Thus, it is more capable in expressing and handling the fuzzy information in engineering practice and scientific research. However, PFSs lack a mathematical tool to express stochastic or probability information, rendering it unsuitable for application in many scenarios. In this article, an ordered number pair is used to describe fuzzy information and stochastic information under uncertain environments, namely constrained Pythagorean fuzzy set (CPFS). The CPFS has two components, $\text{CPFS}=(A,P)$, where $A$ is the classical PFS, while $P$ is a measurement of reliability for $A$. For PFS, CPFS is the first unified description of fuzzy information and probabilistic information, which is a more flexible way to describe knowledge or thinking. Furthermore, the similarity measure of CPFSs is presented, which meets the similarity measure theorems and can better indicate the flexibility of CPFSs. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate that the CPFSs similarity measure is reasonable and effective. The method of similarity measure can be degenerated to the similarity measure of PFSs under specific case and can avoid generating counter-intuitive results. In addition, similarity measure of CPFSs is applied to medical diagnosis and target classification of Iris. These experimental results have proven the practicability and effectiveness of our model.},

  year={2022},
  volume={10},
  number={},
  pages={74111-74130},
  abstract={Cryptoeconomic incentives in the form of blockchain-based tokens are seen as an enabler of the sharing economy that could shift society towards greater sustainability. Nevertheless, knowledge of the impact of these tokens on human sharing behavior is still limited and this poses a challenge to the design of effective cryptoeconomic incentives. This study applies the theory of self-determination to investigate the impact of such tokens on human behavior in an information-sharing scenario. By utilizing an experimental methodology in the form of a randomized control trial with a  $2 \times 2$  factorial design involving 132 participants, the effects of two token incentives on human information-sharing behavior are analyzed. Individuals obtain these tokens in exchange for their shared information. Based on the collected tokens, individuals receive a monetary payment and build reputation. Besides investigating the effect of these incentives on the quantity of shared information, the study includes quality characteristics of the information, such as accuracy and contextualization. The focus on quantity while excluding quality has been identified as a limitation in previous work. In addition to confirming previously known effects such as a crowding-out of intrinsic motivation by incentives, which also exists for blockchain-based tokens, the findings of this paper point to a hitherto unreported interaction effect between multiple tokens when applied simultaneously. The findings are critically discussed and put into the context of recent work and ethical considerations. The theory-based-empirical study is of interest to those investigating the effect of cryptoeconomic tokens or digital currencies on human behavior and supports the community in the design of effective personalized incentives for sharing economies.},

  year={2021},
  volume={29},
  number={2},
  pages={427-441},
  abstract={Motivated by the practical demands for simplification of data toward being consistent with human thinking and problem-solving, as well as tolerance of uncertainty, information granules are becoming important entities in data processing at different levels of data abstraction. This article proposes a method to construct classifiers from multiresolution hierarchical granular representations using hyperbox fuzzy sets. The proposed approach forms a series of granular inferences hierarchically through many levels of abstraction. An attractive characteristic of our classifier is that it can maintain a high accuracy in comparison to other fuzzy min-max models at a low degree of granularity based on reusing the knowledge learned from lower levels of abstraction. In addition, our approach can reduce the data size significantly as well as handle the uncertainty and incompleteness associated with data in real-world applications. The construction process of the classifier consists of two phases. The first phase is to formulate the model at the greatest level of granularity, while the later stage aims to reduce the complexity of the constructed model and deduce it from data at higher abstraction levels. Experimental analyses conducted comprehensively on both synthetic and real datasets indicated the efficiency of our method in terms of training time and predictive performance in comparison to other types of fuzzy min-max neural networks and common machine learning algorithms.},

  abstract={Commuting is an important property in any two-step information merging procedure where the results should not depend on the order in which the single steps are performed. In the case of bisymmetric aggregation operators with the neutral elements, Saminger, Mesiar, and Dubois, have already reduced characterization of commuting n-ary operators to resolving the unary distributive functional equations, but only some sufficient conditions of unary functions distributive over two particular classes of uninorms are given out. Indeed, it is very difficult to get the full characterizations of these equations because they are bound up with the famous Cauchy functional equation, which has so far not been completely solved. Along this way of thinking, in this paper, we will respectively investigate and fully characterize the following two functional equations f(U(x,y))=S(f(x), f(y)) and f(S(x,y))=U(f(x),f(y)), where f:[0,1]→ [0,1] is an unknown function, U is a representable uninorm, and S is a continuous t-conorm. These results are an important step toward obtaining complete characterization of the other unary distributive functional equations previously mentioned. Our results show that commuting is suitable for only the second equation but not for the first one. This is because solutions of the first equation are all piecewise constant functions, while those of the second equation are formulas with parameters. In addition, the two equations both have nonmonotone solutions completely different from those ones obtained.},

  abstract={We give new characterizations and lower bounds relating classes in the communication complexity polynomial hierarchy and circuit complexity to limited memory communication models. We introduce the notion of rectangle overlay complexity of a function f. This is a natural combinatorial complexity measure in terms of combinatorial rectangles in the communication matrix of f. Furthermore, we consider memory less and limited-memory communication models, originally introduced in Brody, Chen, Papakonstantinou, Song, and Sun with slightly different terminology. In these communication models there are two parameters of interest: The maximum message length s (which we think of as space) and the number of memory states w. Specifically, these are one-way protocols which proceed in rounds. In each round, Alice sends a message of at most s bits to Bob, receiving a message from Alice, Bob has to decide on the spot whether to output 0 or 1, or to continue the protocol. If he decides to continue, he immediately forgets Alice's message. In memory less protocols, no memory is transferred between different rounds (but Bob still has "space" to hold Alice's messages within each round). We can make Bob more powerful by giving him w memory states. He can change into a new state at the end of each round. We show that rectangle overlays completely characterize memory less protocols. Then, we go on to show several connections to the communication complexity polynomial hierarchy defined by Babai, Frankl and Simon in 1986. This hierarchy has recently regained attention because its connection to the algebrization barrier in complexity theory (Aaronson and Wigderson, 2009). We show that P^NP^cc is completely characterized by memory less protocols with polylog(n) space (maximum message length), and thus it admits a purely combinatorial characterization in terms of rectangle overlays. If Bob has 3 memory states and Alice sends messages of length polylog(n), they can compute every level of Sigma_k in the communication complexity hierarchy (for constant k), and also every function in AC0. Furthermore, we show that with 5 memory states and messages of length polylog(n) they can compute exactly the functions in the communication class PSPACE^cc. This gives the first meaningful characterization of PSPACE^cc in terms of space, originally defined in Babai, Frankl, and Simon without any notion of space. We also study equivalences and separations between our limited memory communication model and branching programs, and relations to circuit classes.},

  year={2005},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={601-606},
  abstract={In this paper, we introduce a reinforcement learning method for autonomous robots to obtain generalized behavioral concepts. Reinforcement learning is a well formulated method for autonomous robots to obtain a new behavioral concept by themselves. However, these behavioral concepts cannot be applied to other environments that are different from the place where the robots have learned the concepts. On the contrary, we, human beings, can apply our behavioral concepts to some different environments, objects, and/or situations. We think this ability owes to some memory structure like schema system that was originally proposed by J. Piaget. We previously proposed a modular-learning method called Dual-Schemata model. In this paper, we add a reinforcement learning mechanism to this model. By being provided with this structure, autonomous robots become able to obtain new generalized behavioral concepts by themselves. We also show this kind of structure enables autonomous robots to behave appropriately even in a novel socially interactive environment.},

  year={2006},

  number={},
  pages={46-46},
  abstract={This paper deals with the specification and analysis of Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS). We use a timed process algebra called BTC (for Bounded True Concurrency) that we have developed from CSP and which takes into account that the available resources in a system have to be shared by all the processes. It is able to consider heterogeneous resources of any type (preemptable and non- preemptable) which makes it suitable for specifying FMS. We show by means of an example that the specifications obtained suit the real systems quite well, are straightforward and deadlock-free. Due to the great interest (and need) in obtaining shorter manufacturing lead times, we also carry out a performance evaluation using an algorithm which allows us to estimate the time required to evolve between states. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to do this with process algebras, and we think that it is a good way to be able to split up the system into subsystems, which will be easily analyzed without the deadlock problems that researchers in Petri Nets have encountered.},

  title={Sentiment Analysis of Handwritten and Text Statement for Emotion Classification using Intelligent Techniques: A Novel Approach}, 
  year={2023},

  abstract={Traditionally, many people still wish to write on pen and paper. However, it has some drawbacks, like accessing and storing physical documents efficiently, searching through them, and sharing them efficiently. Handwriting to Text Conversion (HTC) classifies and converts an individual’s handwriting into digital form. However, HTC removes all the mentioned problems as storing, retrieving, and using the text as and when required is easier. Emotions are a basic and particularly important aspect of one’s life. To understand this important aspect of an individual’s life, we must detect emotions using affect data like text, voice, and image. We have used text as the effect data for this work. We can find a person’s emotions behind his text by sentiment analysis. Sentiment recognition and analysis is a topic with wide research as many brands, companies, and even famous personalities are very much interested in getting feedback and thus do the evaluation of their performance and knowing what people think about them around the world. Authors have proposed a model where they collected data from social media reviews and classified it into three broad categories, which are positive, negative, and neutral. Find the emotions category viz. happiness, sadness, shame, anger, disgust, fear, surprise, or neutral from three types of classified sentiments. The proposed model combined machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing techniques to achieve the best outcome.},

  abstract={The design and development of smart products and services with data science enabled solutions forms a core topic of the current trend of digitalisation in industry. Enabling skilled staff, employees, and students to use data science in their daily work routine of designing such products and services is a key concern of higher education institutions, including universities, company workshop providers and in further education. The scope and usage scenario of this paper is to assess software modules ('tools') for integrated data and analytics as service (DAaaS). The tools are usually driven by machine learning, may be deployed in cloud infrastructures, and are specifically targeted at particular needs of the industrial manufacturing, production, or supply chain sector. The paper describes existing theories and previous work, namely methods used in didactics, work done for visually designing and using machine learning algorithms (no-code /low-code tools), as well as combinations of these two topics. For tools available on the market, an extended assessment of their suitability for a set of learning scenarios and personas is discussed.},
