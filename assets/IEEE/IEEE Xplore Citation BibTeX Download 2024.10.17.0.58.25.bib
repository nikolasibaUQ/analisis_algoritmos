  abstract={In the ever-evolving field of technologies, the emergence of artificial general intelligence (AGI), often referred as strong artificial intelligence (AI), stands as a breakthrough in the realm of machine intelligence, promising to witness a new era of capabilities and possibilities. In particular, AGI ventures into human-level cognition, and expands to thinking, reasoning, and awareness. This imminent evolution is envisioned to be manifested through the embodiment of AI machines, allowing machines to transcend their purely computational nature and interact with the world through the different senses. Accordingly, AI agents will be grounded in the physical environment, going through subjective experiences and acquiring the needed knowledge that will lead to understanding and cognition. In our article, we explore the path toward realizing the true vision of AGI through AI embodiment, where we dig into the different types of thinking required to achieve knowledge, and hence, cognition and understanding. Furthermore, we look through the evolution of generative AI models, and shed light on the limitations of auto-regression in large language models (LLMs), with the aim to answer the question: is sensory grounding (through 6G) necessary, and enough, to achieve understanding in LLMs? Finally, we identify the main pillars of AGI and unveil how 6G networks will orchestrate the development of AGI systems.},

  title={Machines That Feel and Think: The Role of Affective Feelings and Mental Action in (Artificial) General Intelligence}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={28},
  number={3},
  pages={289-309},
  abstract={What role do affective feelings (feelings/emotions/moods) play in adaptive behaviour? What are the implications of this for understanding and developing artificial general intelligence? Leading theoretical models of brain function are beginning to shed light on these questions. While artificial agents have excelled within narrowly circumscribed and specialised domains, domain-general intelligence has remained an elusive goal in artificial intelligence research. By contrast, humans and nonhuman animals are characterised by a capacity for flexible behaviour and general intelligence. In this article I argue that computational models of mental phenomena in predictive processing theories of the brain are starting to reveal the mechanisms underpinning domain-general intelligence in biological agents, and can inform the understanding and development of artificial general intelligence. I focus particularly on approaches to computational phenomenology in the active inference framework. Specifically, I argue that computational mechanisms of affective feelings in active inference—affective self-modelling—are revealing of how biological agents are able to achieve flexible behavioural repertoires and general intelligence. I argue that (i) affective self-modelling functions to “tune” organisms to the most tractable goals in the environmental context; and (ii) affective and agentic self-modelling is central to the capacity to perform mental actions in goal-directed imagination and creative cognition. I use this account as a basis to argue that general intelligence of the level and kind found in biological agents will likely require machines to be implemented with analogues of affective self-modelling.},

  abstract={Several reasons have led to the widespread adoption of neural-based algorithms for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR), including their high performance, elegant model designs, and parallel computing capabilities. Numerous ASR models have been proposed to improve the recognition results, but the gains are still insufficient. This paper proposes a re-thinking ASR model, which aims to bridge the gap by rethinking the regularities of a given hypothesis and the relationship between text-level and acoustic-level characteristics of the input speech utterance. For the re-thinking ASR model, a mixed attention mechanism, a self-and-mixed attention mechanism, and a deep acoustic feature extractor are meticulously designed to enable the notion to be realized. A publicly available benchmark corpus is used to evaluate the proposed model. As the experimental results demonstrate, the proposed re-thinking ASR model can provide significant and consistent improvements over popular baseline systems.},

  abstract={As one of the most striking research hotspots in both academia and industry, Internet of Things (IoT) has been constantly changing our daily life by joining together nearly all we can imagine. From home furnishings and vehicles to urban facilities, all these smart things need powerful managing and processing capabilities to deal with mass multimedia data in different content forms such as images, audios, and videos. Nowadays, since Moore's Law is no longer applicable, conventional thinking may not be adequate in facing the explosive growing amount of data. Hence, in this paper, we adopt the idea of in-memory processing to solve the problem of real-time multimedia big data computing in IoT. We apply closed-loop feedback in the scheduling method design to integrate in-memory storages of all devices within a 3-tier network structure. In addition, we consider the respective conditions of different real-time required levels and content forms. The analysis results show that our scheduling method can achieve better workload allocation with less latency in comparison of existing methods.},

  abstract={It is widely acknowledged that many freshmen go to university without any prior grounding in computer science. Recent studies conducted in the US have shown that not only do high school students lack any exposure, but also they possess ill-conceived notions of what computer science is, a problem also affecting their parents, teachers and regional school superintendents. For incoming students, the extent to which computing technology impacts their daily lives is very likely at odds with the extent to which they have considered how software works and its ethical implications. The ability to critically analyze and consider related ethical consequences of computing is an important life skill for every twenty-first century adult and not just computer scientists. With this this in mind, this paper presents a unique CS0 introduction to programming and computer ethics for pre CS and non majors. It has been defined as a service course to promote digital literacy and to ensure that students appreciate what computer science is and its socio-ethical implications. The paper outlines the course and its content in detail, as well as providing quantitative and qualitative evidence of its benefit and appeal to female students.},

The understanding of these relations may help to identify students' characteristics that may point out to the teacher the need for individualized support.},

  abstract={In this study we assess the effects of teaching fundamental programming concepts through a virtual reality (VR) block-based programming application and its impact on engagement. As a comparison study, participants played an existing desktop-based game (LightBot) and the developed VR game (LogiBot) covering similar gameplay mechanics and block-based programming. Initial results indicate that traditional desktop applications are currently more engaging than VR for teaching programming. We thus identify the need for careful design of interaction methods to support ease of use and reward factors to promote engagement in VR-based learning applications beyond the initial wow-factor.},

  abstract={Our contemporary society necessitates professionals equipped with 21st-century skills. Disciplines within Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (known as STEAM) have been particularly effective in fostering these skills. However, when considering students with disabilities, especially those with intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDD), this assertion often falls short. In this context, the RoboSTEAMSEN project emerges as an initiative designed to enhance educational processes by providing teachers of IDD students with the necessary resources to promote STEAM engagement. The project proposes the use of active learning methodologies and robotics to achieve this goal. The primary objective of the project is realized through several strategies: understanding the needs of students with disabilities and adapting the use of robotics and active learning methodologies accordingly; training teachers in the use of these resources; and creating a platform to exchange experiences, resources, lessons learned, tools, case scenarios, etc., while reaching other potential stakeholders such as caregivers and policymakers. The main outcomes of the project are teacher training programs and the development of associated competencies, tools to identify and classify resources for the students, and technological platforms to ensure the sustain ability of the project once it concludes.},

  abstract={Women are underrepresented in the field of Computer Science. This project aims to help Secondary School girls develop an insight into the role computers play in society and to learn some of the key skills in computing including computer programming. Exposure to Computer Science, in home or school environments, and encouragement from family and peers are leading factors that influence girls' decisions to pursue careers in Computer Science. Other factors include the girls' perception of their own problem solving ability, an understanding of the diverse applications of Computer Science and related career paths and the potential for positive social impact. This paper describes the design of an after school computing programme, CodePlus, which uses a novel 21st Century learning model. Pre and post questionnaire are being used to explore girls intentions to study CS, their confidence to study CS, perception of CS as a career, gender perception of CS and IT profession and self-efficacy following participation in the CodePlus programme. Preliminary results comparing pre questionnaire results with a male control group highlight differences in how girls see themselves in terms of CS capabilities and their future potential. Initial post questionnaire findings show a significant increase in the participants' perceived programming ability.},

  year={2018},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={The impact of technology on workforce development and socioeconomic prosperity has made K-12 computing engineering and STEM in general a national educational priority. However, the integration of computing remains obstructed by resources and lack of professional development to support students' learning. Further challenging is students' STEM attitudes and interest do not matriculate with them into higher education. This issue is especially critical for traditionally under represented and underserved populations including females, racial/ethnic minority groups, and students of low-socioeconomic status (SES). To help mitigate challenges, we developed an unplugged (computer-less) computing engineering and robotics lesson composed of two introductory computing concepts, sequencing and decision-making, using a small robot arm and tangible programming blocks. Through students' sequencing of operations, debugging, and executing complex robotic behavior, we seek to determine if students' interest or attitudes change toward engineering. Nine one-hour introductory pilot lessons with 148 students, grades 6-10, at two public middle schools, and one summer camp were conducted. We measured students' engineering interest and attitudes through a 15 question pre- and post-lesson survey and calculated aggregate factor scores for interest and attitudes. We found low-SES students' a priori interests and attitudes tend to be lower and more varied than those of their high-SES peers. These preliminary results suggest that the integration of introductory computing and robotics lessons in low-SES classrooms may help students reach similar levels of engineering interest and attitudes as their high-SES peers.},

  abstract={As part of the 3D printing summer course for undergrads in our university, students were introduced to Autodesk Tinkercad as a design tool for creating and editing 3D models. After a brief period of familiarization with Tinkercad, we presented students with Codeblocks, a tool integrated with Tinkercad that enables the creation of 3D models through programming under the blocks model. To our surprise, students started creating complex and lengthy programs to produce original printable 3D objects. We decided to investigate this level of engagement using a questionnaire to collect opinions and experiences from students and a set of metrics to categorize their programming work. The results obtained are presented in this paper along with our conjectures on the causes of the enthusiasm observed with Codeblocks. Three factors seem to have been key in this case: diversity in the composition of the student group, availability of 3D printers to materialize designs, and a relaxed environment where test and failure were common and acceptable.},

The results clearly indicate that the students selected this major on their own, based on their previous experiences in informatics, but that these experiences caused misconceptions rather than creating a true picture of the nature of computer sciences. Based on the analysis of the students' answers, we concluded that they are in great need of institutional support, especially at the beginning of their tertiary studies, to introduce them to computer sciences/informatics. Beyond this, we have revealed another misconception that Software Engineering students tend to focus on the coding aspect of informatics, and especially those who have taken the advanced level school leaving exam are over-confident as regards their programming skills.},

  abstract={Programming is a traditional part of informatics education from Primary to Upper Secondary Education in Slovakia. We have seen a growing interest of using Python in programming at our secondary schools during the past six years. However, the transition from using the still prevalent Pascal to Python is often only formal, regardless of the language specifics of Python. In addition, teaching programming is oriented primarily to mastering language constructions. In the frame of the National project IT Academy we have focused on inquiry-based programming teaching. In our teaching and learning materials we exploit the 5E learning cycle. Firstly, pupils are engaged in a topic, then they explore a topic and give explanation for their findings, then elaborate on their learning and finally are evaluated. Their learning is not focused just on acquiring skills and experience using suitable Python commands and data structures, but also on using various problem solving strategies. The paper presents examples of teaching materials and interesting findings and comments from pilot teachers.},

  abstract={Virtual Reality has been one of the interesting topics that have risen in the previous years. It has diverged into many fields including medicine, tourism, and education. On the other hand, new techniques have been used for teaching programming rather than the traditional paper and pen technique. The work presented in this paper proposes a new way of teaching children programming using the Virtual Reality (VR) technology. A game has been implemented with Scratch-like background to test whether the immersive factor of VR would have a positive effect on the learning outcome of the children. A study has been conducted on 10 participants to compare between two techniques for teaching the basic programming concepts: VR game and Desktop game. Results showed that the mean of the learning gain of the VR group was higher than the Desktop mean but with no significant p-value. However, the engagement test results showed that the participants were more engaged to the VR game than the Desktop game with p-value of 0.032.},

  abstract={This report highlights evidence from a research to practice partnership (RPP) designed to examine computer science (CS) integration in rural K-8 schools. The project implements a design approach that encourages collaboration between educators, tech integrators, and administrators. They act as co-researchers in identifying and examining connections between barriers to integration.},

  abstract={This poster describes the overarching goals of a newly awarded NSF-funded grant (DRL-1837439) designed to address the provision of equitable access to underrepresented students (e.g., females, African-Americans, Hispanic/Latinx) in computing. Collaborative Research: Broadening Participation with the STEM Ecosystem: Developing a Scalable Model using an RPP Approach evolved out of the research team’s past experiences with developing strategic partnerships with school administrators and classroom teachers to bring computationally-rich activities to students throughout the school day, but especially in core math and science courses.},

  abstract={Until relatively recently, technology has been used as a passive tool that makes the learner a user of various applications. However, this has been changing thanks to the widespread idea that all children should have the opportunity to learn a little computer skills from an early age, since they will live in a world where computing is everywhere. Aware that the teaching of programming is not the future but the present, countries such as the United States, Singapore, Estonia and even Spain, face this strategic challenge, which not only prepares students for an increasingly technological labour market, it encourages the development of useful skills for any student regardless of their future professional activity. With this idea in mind, this article describes the case study carried out in a classroom of Early Childhood Education, with students of 5 years of age, with which basic programming concepts have been worked out. The results obtained indicate that they have been able to master the new vocabulary, assimilate the concepts and work for themselves with the chosen tool to carry out the intervention.},

  abstract={The global video game industry's revenues reached 7.2 billion in 2007 and over $65 billion in 2012 with projected growth over $80 billion by 2017. As new consoles, PC, and mobile devices penetrate more foreign markets, revenues derived from these devices and software will continue to increase. In a nationally representative sample of U.S. teens, 99% of boys and 94% of girls played video games. Over 45% of women play video games and 30% of people over the age of 50 play games on a regular basis. Overall, 72% of Americans play video games in the U.S. and the amount of time spent playing games continues to increase, as do foreign markets. The increased market capitalization of the industry increases demand of qualified applicants. Other industries leveraging similar technology are beginning to grow and have topped over $10 billion in revenue in 2014. Students with expertise in game and related technology will have an advantage in these new job opportunities. Christian Brothers University (CBU) seeks to fill this need by the creation of a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Management (BSEM - Information Management) in Video Game Design. This degree will give students the skills needed to pursue a career within the game industry and others while developing engineering skills.},
