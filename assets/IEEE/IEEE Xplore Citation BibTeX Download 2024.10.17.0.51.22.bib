  abstract={This full research-track paper demonstrates growth in computational thinking in a cohort of engineering students completing their first course in engineering at a large Southwestern university in the United States. Computational thinking has been acknowledged as a key aspect of engineering education and an intrinsic part of multiple ABET outcomes. However, computing is an area where some students have more privileges (e.g. access and exposure to meaningful use of computers) than others. Integrating computing into engineering, especially early in the curriculum, may exacerbate existing experiential disadvantages students from excluded social identities experience. Most introductory engineering programs have a component of programming and/or computational thinking. A comprehensive literature review showed that no existing computational thinking framework fully met the needs of students and professors in engineering and computer science. As a result, this team created the Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic (ECTD). This diagnostic was assessed and improved during the 2019-2020 academic year. Data was collected from a cohort in a first-year engineering course that included topics in mathematics, engineering problem solving, and computation. Pre- and post-test data analysis with 62 participants documents statistically significant student growth in computational thinking in this course. Significant differences were not found by gender or a limited racially-based analysis. This diagnostic is of interest and relevance to all institutions providing engineering and computing programs. The short-term impact of this research includes an innovative approach to gauge student abilities in computational thinking early in a course in order to add appropriate intervention activities into lesson plans. The long-term impact is the creation of a measurement of student learning of computational thinking in engineering for courses and programs that wish to develop this important skill in their students.},

  title={Inequalities in Computational Thinking Among Incoming Students in an STEM Chilean University}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={67},
  number={2},
  pages={180-189},
  abstract={While computational thinking arises as an essential skill worldwide, formal primary and secondary education in Latin America rarely incorporates mechanisms to develop it in their curricula. The extent to which students in the region acquire computational thinking skills remains largely unknown. To start addressing this void, this article presents findings from a cross sectional study that characterizes the computational thinking abilities of incoming students at a Chilean university with a strong emphasis on STEM disciplines. Based on more than 500 responses, this study provides evidence of significant inequalities in computational thinking across gender, type of school (private or no), and prior programming knowledge. The discussion offers insights into how these disparities relate to contextual factors of the country, such as a highly socio-economically segregated educational system, public policies focused mainly on technology access, and heavy reliance on voluntary initiatives, to develop computational thinking. The findings can enlighten upcoming research endeavors and formulate strategies to create a more equitable field for students entering STEM degrees in nations facing similar circumstances.},

  abstract={In 2018, the Ministry of Education released the Action Plan for Education Informatization 2.0, which puts forward new requirements for modern education and teaching. Under the influence of the computer Internet, modern teaching has not only changed the way of teaching and learning, but also promoted the improvement of educational concept. In the face of the current new trend, how to cultivate students' computer thinking ability in the teaching of computer courses has gradually become a hot topic in the field of computer education at home and abroad. This paper mainly describes the concept of computer thinking, characteristics and research status at home and abroad, at the same time, comprehensive description of the specific significance of the development of computer thinking, as well as how to cultivate students' computer thinking, finally do a whole summary of computer thinking, and add their own thinking. Under the new situation, we should advocate the development of computer thinking, keep up with the pace of The Times, and attach importance to the cultivation of students' computer thinking, so that students can better deal with the problems in life by the course learning.},

  abstract={Training computer scientists to address wicked problems means to focus respectively on the individual capability to think in a computational-oriented way (i.e., Computational Thinking), and on the social dimension of coding (i.e., Agile Values). In this study we propose the conceptual model of Cooperative Thinking, a new education construct of team-based computational problem solving. Cooperative Thinking is not only the sum of Computational Thinking and Agile Values, rather it is a new overarching competence suitable to deal with complex software engineering problems. We suggest to tackle the Cooperative Thinking construct as an education goal, to train new generations of software developers to Pareto-optimize both their individual and teaming performances.},

  abstract={Computational Thinking (CT) is considered a necessary 21st-century competence that should be introduced to school education as a vital ingredient. However, the lack of a consensual definition of CT and the confusion with other similar terms made it a big challenge for researchers and practitioners to understand this concept. The purpose of this work-in-progress (WIP) is to identify and compare the existing definitions of CT proposed by various members of the education or research community, and ultimately to give educators and researchers suggestions on understanding this concept for particular purposes or situations. We conducted a systematic review of the definitions of CT from the source of academic articles and categorized the definitions based on their approaches, dimensions, and contexts. Forty-one unique and original concepts were extracted from the search. Results indicate that the existing definitions of CT were mostly formulated 1) with a prototype approach, 2) for the generic purpose of use, 3) in the context of K-12 education, 4) based on the subject of Computer Science. These results provide sufficient granularity to allow us to come up with suggestions on how to choose appropriate and pragmatic CT definitions.},

  abstract={This Research to Practice Work-in-Progress paper discusses a next-generation learning system for K-12 students to educate them on scientific concepts surrounding the human body. Specifically, our gamified learning system is designed to make learning more fun, engaging, and effective through game and experiment elements that align with science and math learning standards. It will also increase systematic problem-solving and algorithmic reasoning for K-12 students. Since the human body can be thought of as a combination of interacting systems, the game also introduces students to computational thinking by introducing internal body functions. To achieve these goals, this project has two components. First, an educational virtual reality game will be built according to the natural human body structure. During the game process, students will experience the same as the human body functions, travel along the blood circulation, help with the heartbeat, and participate in oxygen exchange. While students are playing the game, our gamified adaptive learning system tracks and controls the student's learning progress. As the AI component collects student data and uses this information, our system adjusts game content and addresses possible learner issues to refine the learning curriculum for a faster and more effective learning experience. Second, a series of hands-on activities will be conducted based on the functions of the human body (e.g., developing an artificial heart and experiencing how the heart works). Through this project, an attractive and efficient next-generation learning system will be developed and used to expose K-12 students to this learning system. The education of students will be accomplished in different dimensions through games and hands-on practice, respectively. Additionally, compared to traditional learning methods, our learning system not only increases students' interest in learning but also makes it more personalized compared to the conventional learning process. Likewise, we will refer to the results of self-efficacy surveys administered to students and teachers separately to test their perceptions of their abilities and the new system.},

  abstract={Physiological computing (PC) technology is becoming increasingly popular as wearable hardware improves. However, little is known regarding potential connections between hands-on experience with physiological computing technology and computation thinking perspectives. This is particularly true for black communities. Applications for physiological computing include systems such as wearable technology (e.g., Apple Watch) capable of mapping students' physiological activity to various outputs. The work discussed in this paper presents our initial steps toward filling these gaps. In particular, we share our observations of computational thinking perspectives that emerged while black high school students constructed simple programs driven by near real-time brain wave information. Our findings suggest interactive physiological data may lead to unique computational perspectives during learning activities.},

  abstract={Studies with augmented reality show that while the technology helps the student learn, it may end up disturbing other points, showing that more research is needed with the use of augmented reality. Also, a topic that is growing within education is Computational Thinking, which says that the thinking like computer scientists is necessary for the 21st century and should be disseminated mainly in schools during basic education. In the face of this, this work created an augmented reality android application that tracks physical tiles and creates 3D maps for the user, also giving a character that can be programmed to walk on this created map, simulating a programming toy. Finally, tests carried out with the application have shown that augmented reality currently has performance problems when multiple targets are used, so, devices with low processing have problems at map tracking. These issues affected the tests with the children, which made it difficult for them to track the map like they wanted, but they still liked the app even after it. That shows that the acceptance of the technology by the children is good, which can help developing Computational Thinking, but the technology limitation is still a problem. These obstacles while currently hindering the use of augmented reality in education may in the future be irrelevant due to the constant advancement of technology. This paper's main contribution is showing one possibility of using AR with Computational Thinking and what needs to evolve for it to be used by the usable by the children.},

Their interactive teaching experiences were measured via the CS-TGCTS simulation. The findings in this study suggest that preservice teachers with a high level of critical-thinking dispositions and those with judicial or legislative thinking styles are analytical and reflective vis A-vis their teaching practice and, as a consequence, they experienced great behavior change, whereas those with executive styles did not exhibit significant behavior change at the end of the simulated teaching.},

Through this study, in which a robot was used as a springboard for debate with twenty 8- to 9-year-old children at school, we exemplify how the deceptive nature of robots, if embraced and magnified in order for it to become explicitly controversial, can be used to nurture children's critical mindset.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This work-in-progress paper introduces an innovative approach that uses computational notebooks to teach Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate course to aid the understanding of complex phenomena in Mechanics of Materials, and enhance students' computational thinking skills. Research indicates that students, irrespective of their educational level, face difficulties in grasping fundamental concepts in mechanics of materials. These challenges arise from the inherent complexity of concepts like stress, strain, torsion, and buckling, which are difficult to observe, hindering comprehension. Therefore, this work aims to leverage the synergy between mechanics of materials and computational principles to actively engage students in advanced topics such as structural strength, failure of structures, and sensitivity analysis, through the use of computational notebooks. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we first asked students to analyze truss structures using hand calculations following the discrete stiffness method within a Finite Element Analysis framework. Subsequently, we implemented the same method as a simulation tool in a MATLAB Computational Notebook. Finally, we asked the students to reflect on: (1) the value of using computational methods to approach Finite Element Analysis when compared to hand calculations; (2) the difficulties they faced when implementing the activities in the MATLAB Computational Notebook; (3) the support they required to successfully complete these activities; and (4) the effectiveness of the simulation tool in understanding the effect of forces and stress distributions in structures. We anticipate that computational notebooks will provide an ideal platform for sharing lessons and tutorials, enhancing student engagement, and promoting active learning. Students have access to the complete source code, allowing them to develop computational skills. Early exposure to coding, modeling, and simulation techniques is crucial in preparing students for the computational demands of modern engineering workplaces.},

  abstract={The course “Computer Foundation of University” shoulders the mission of cultivating computational thinking and information literacy, and plays an important basic role in the general education curriculum system of undergraduate education. How to put computational thinking training into practice in teaching strategy design is problem worth researching. This paper gives an understanding of the nature, status and role of the course firstly. On this basis, instructional design research is carried out from the aspects of objective design, content design, teaching strategy design and evaluation design, etc. The purpose is to find feasible implementation strategies according to the characteristics and training objectives of the course, so as to realize the teaching objectives of the course and truly implement the training of computational thinking.},

  abstract={Computational Thinking is one of the fundamental skills of the 21st century and will be a necessary part of all future work, so it is essential that children learn it in school. One way to work on Computational Thinking is through data visualization. This paper presents the motivation, design and implementation of a platform called AlfaDatizando, through which it is possible to work with data visualization activities to promote the skill of Computational Thinking in Digital Humanities. AlfaDatizando allows the creation, resolution, and feedback of data visualization activities without the need to use another platform. It also allows sharing didactic sequences and data sources with the educational community registered in the platform. AlfaDatizando is still in an early stage of development.},

  abstract={The paper discusses tools for teaching logic used in Logic & Proofs, a web-based introduction to modern logic that has been taken by more than 1,300 students since the fall of 2003. The tools include a wide array of interactive learning environments or cognitive mini-tutors; most important among them is the Carnegie Proof Lab. The Proof Lab is a sophisticated interface for constructing natural deduction proofs and is central, as strategically guided discovery of proofs is the distinctive focus of the course. My discussion makes explicit the broader intellectual context, but also the pursuit of pedagogical goals and their experimental examination. The intellectual context includes i) the theoretical background for the proof search algorithm AProS and its use for a dynamic Proof Tutor, and ii) the programmatic expansion of the course to Computational Logic. (I recommend that the reader enter the virtual classroom of Logic & Proofs: the interactive components just cannot be properly reflected in a narrative. It is also very easy to download AProS and observe its ways of searching for proofs.) 1},
