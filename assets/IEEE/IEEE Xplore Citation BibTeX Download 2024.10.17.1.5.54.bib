  abstract={Summary form only given. The amount of digital information and the number of digital services are increasing explosively, and being beyond the human ability to use such massive information and services by direct operations on computers/devices. As a user, one may not know exactly what is the most needed, among which is the most suitable, and where is the best place to go in the digitally explosive world. In recent years, autonomic computing, context-aware computing, human-centric computing and so on have been proposed to make computers/devices capable of taking automatic responses according to users' states, preferences, ambient information, etc. Individual-aware computing is a computing paradigm based on the digital clone, called Cyber-Individual or Cyber-I, which is a correspondent of a real individual (Real-I). Cyber-I is far beyond merely a user model or a software agent to assist a user. It is aimed at providing the most comprehensive digital entities for its corresponding Real-I in terms of individual's experience, behavior and thinking as well as its birth, growth, and death. Cyber-I enables a Real-I to have a new form of existence in the cyber world and exhibit symbiosis with the Real-I. A Real-I's abilities may be continuously extended with increasing services or applications based on the Cyber-I. Individual-aware computing and Cyber-I are to aggregate multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary studies as well as a variety of technologies for realizing the harmony of humans, computers, and things.},

The use of fuzzy clustering method of neural network combines the adaptivity and the fault tolerance of the neural network organic manner with the fuzzy comprehensive discrimination in the human thinking simulation of fuzzy logic, so as to recognize the reservoir heterogeneity through multi-factor fuzzy comprehensive judgment and reasoning. This method has been used to treat the data about the 135 wells in Xujiahe Group in central Sichuan, and has shown good results, with a coincidence rate as high as 87.6%. The result demonstrates that this method enjoys good adaptivity against the problem of automatic recognition of the reservoir heterogeneity, and could improve the precision of automatic recognition of the reservoir heterogeneity.},

  abstract={Shoulder has a wide range of motion. Contact point between the glenoid and the humeral head, tension of soft tissue, and alignment of muscles connecting the bones drastically change in its range of motion. Mechanism stabilizing shoulder joint is influenced by arm positioning. Assessment of joint stability should always take arm positioning into consideration. In fact, there is a subtle instability which can only be detected when the arm is elevated. The glenoid dysplasia might be a cause for its instability. These findings can be detected only by 3D computer generated images except in some typical cases. Generally, joint stability is judged by location of the humeral head center in the glenoid. More intricate approach is necessary for some disorders. Analysis of contact area and other glenohumeral relation can clarify instability which cannot be detected through investigating location of joint center. The studies using those parameters showed that the joint is inherently unstable with the arm externally rotated at 90 degrees of elevation, and that joint positioning would be more apt to be affected from the cocking to the acceleration phase during throwing activity. We think such instability might lead to throwing disorders.},

  abstract={Video streaming technology has swiftly emerged in the field of information and technology. In comparison to traditional cable broadcasters whose content could only be watched on TVs, video streaming is ubiquitous and viewers can flexibly watch the video contents on various devices, ranging from smartphones to laptops, and large TV screens. In the Applications nowadays, content on the platform exists far in advance even before a user thinks to watch it. It can be preprocessed easily. Heavy compression techniques can be used and videos can be prepared with different qualities and transmission rates. In past some decades devices on which streaming is done have been transformed totally from televisions to OTTs which stream a large amount of content. Also, various electronic gadgets like laptops, tablets etc. provide ease to users to watch the content with portable facility. It has been noted that among all the sites browsed, streaming websites/services holds around 60% of all. The basic idea behind implementing the modules is that some content is widely available over the internet and is accessible to everyone irrespective of their age. Also, people are using these platforms as a source of entertainment for most of the time during the day which eventually leads to eye problems. Be it phone or laptop or any other device watching screen for so long in a day is not good for health.},

  year={2017},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={11-15},
  abstract={Prof. LotfiAskarZadeh had revolutionized the field of logics by proposing a novel logic, Fuzzy Logic, in 1965 where there is smooth transition between different classes due to overlapping of membership functions, and each element in fuzzy set has a degree of membership. Fuzzy Logic was considered appropriate to represent any vague or ambiguous situation of the real life problems. It also has the provision of allowing linguistic variables whose truth values may vary between 0 and 1; in contrast to two values of classical logic. Quite recently, Neutrosophic Logic was proposed by Florentine Smarandache, which is based on non-standard analysis that was given by Abraham Robinson in 1960s. Neutrosophic Logic was developed to represent mathematical model of uncertainty, vagueness, ambiguity, imprecision, undefined, unknown, incompleteness, inconsistency, redundancy, and contradiction that encompasses the shortcomings of every other logic studied in the past. All the factors stated are very integral to human thinking, as it is very rare that we tend to conclude/judge in definite environments, imprecision of human systems could be due to the imperfection of knowledge that human receives (observation) from the external world. Imperfection leads to a doubt about the value of a variable, a decision to be taken or a conclusion to be drawn for the actual system. Multiple factors could lead to uncertainty like incomplete knowledge (ignorance of the totality, limited view on a system because of its complexity), stochasticity (the case of intrinsic imperfection where a typical and single value does not exist), or the acquisition errors (intrinsically imperfect observations, the quantitative errors in measures). This talk would focus on the overlapping regions of the fuzzy systems in which a method has been proposed for using neutrosophic logic and assign a triplet of the form (t, i, f) for the points that are spanned by overlapping ranges, in such a way that every such output is assigned a true, indeterminate and false value.},

Squeezer is one such clustering algorithm for categorical data and it is more efficient than most existing algorithms for categorical data.

Thus, we employ the distributed thinking to improve Squeezer and a distributed algorithm for categorical data called Coercion is proposed in this paper. In order to present detailed complexity results for Coercion, we also conduct an experimental study with standard as well as synthetic data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new algorithm.},

Connections arose from the H2020 R& D funding program can also be analysed this way that is hugely affected by endogenous impacts. Nevertheless, self-organization occurs naturally that results high preferential points, near scale-free connection-network and significant inequalities among partners, EU member states and regions. Albeit the goal of such programs is not to increase regional cohesion but to remove obstacles from a borderless knowledge transfer, the two fields are not sharply separable. The aim of the present study is to shed light on regional connections within the H2020 social network and its time evolution via investigation of graph centrality measures. Since long-term regional development also necessitates strategical thinking regarding resource allocation on innovative fields, results could also be utilized by corresponding policymakers.},

A considerable part of the low SNR spectra are not released or measured parameters, some of these can improve the SNR by the method of spectra stacking. Firstly, targets are selected whose distances of latitude or longitude are less than a certain threshold value. Then, calculating direct distances of targets if distances are less than a certain threshold value, we can think that they are repeated observations of the target star. Finally, stacking observations of the target star if they have same results of wavelength calibration.},

  abstract={Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have become popular for their versatility and flexibility in implementing various digital circuits. An FPGA-VLSI processor's effectiveness is directly proportional to the speed with which its various digital signal processing operations may be carried out. The goal of this technique is to attain both a high level of accuracy and a high rate of speed. Approximate multipliers (AP) are among the fastest multipliers that are available and are used in FPGA-VLSI systems that are based on artificial intelligence (AI). A 64-bit multiplicator can be approximated with a 64-bit number thanks to the study that was suggested. We are employing the partial product or dada based multiplication technique to implement the suggested 64 bit digital approximate multiplier. This technique allows the 64 bit multiplication operation to be completed in the partial form. 64 bits multiplied by 32, 16, 8, 4, and 2 bits respectively after being broken up. We are thinking about performance characteristics like the area, the latency, and the PDP right now. The area is decreasing by up to 55%, and the latency and PDP are both decreasing by approximately up to 70% when compared to the present work. The multiplier under consideration achieves an accuracy of 99%. The virtex 7 family is represented by the FPGA integrated circuit that was used for the simulation.},

Regarding the present and the foreseeable future, I would particularly like to review recent research that shows - it seems stronger than just “suggests” - that students who take notes on laptops learn less well than students who use pen-and-paper, and from there speculate a little about the consequent implications for CIVEMSA topics.},

Just think of it, where light can be used as a medium of data communication and it is also a source of light (vision). How easy our work would be, the VLC technology is mostly used in indoor communication. The reason for this technology to evolve is the increasing number of crimes. In the present day, the number of internet users are more, there is no work done without the help of the internet. Due to this, the possibility of cyberattacks is more. Most of our personal data and confidential information is lost due to cyberattacks. The companies have faced a lot of financial losses because of it. The data transfer in VLC cannot be hacked easily. It is least prone for the attacks to take placeas communication is mostly indoors. In this paper, we have realized VLC in SISO and $\mathbf{4}\times \mathbf{4}$ MIMO configurations. It is observed that the $\mathbf{4}\times \mathbf{4}$ MIMO configuration outperforms SISO in terms of Bit error rate and Quality Factor.},

  abstract={This paper focuses on space-time non-linear intelligent modeling for regional data, researches how to apply back-propagation neural network (BPN) into analysis of regional data. Thinking about sectional instability of spatial pattern, this paper divided space units of researching regions into different subregions by improved K-means algorithm based on spatial adjacency relationship. Then build a space-time model with BPN. To solve the problem that deviation is too large in determining boundary of zonings by BPN model when data dimension increased, this paper bring forward a modular BPN model which named regional space-time neural network (RSTNN) model, modeling and predicting respectively based on every zoning with BPN. At last, compare the abilities of modular BPN model and global BPN model by means of analysis of an example.},

  abstract={Clinical Data mining as an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science is becoming increasingly important in recent years. While, so far, there is not a complete web based medical data analysis and mining platform. Weka is one of the most widely used data mining tools with a variety of algorithms integrated. However, as a workbench, it can not be integrated into specific web based business system. Also lots of defects are detected in our or other practitioner's daily usage such as preprocessing functions can't satisfy the actual needs. While the most badly shortcoming, we think, is visulization and it can not integrated into web based business system. This paper presents a web based weka in a real application scenario of exploring the relationship between blood routine examination results and fifteen common hematological diseases. As an innovative point, we combine weka with D3, this strategy not only solving the problem of implementing visualization on the web front-end but also making visualization more powerful than weka original. Also, we integrate our weka into pentaho BI.},

  abstract={Total quality management (TQM) is based on a number ideas and concepts. It means thinking about quality in terms of all functions of the enterprise and is a start - to - finish process that integrates interrelated functions at all levels. The problem appears by defining the ldquototal qualityrdquo term. In this paper, quality is not only meeting customer's requirements, formal and informal, at lowest cost, first time and every time, it includes also the requirements of the environment. This requires the enlargement of traditional TQM concepts and the creation of a new model and framework for Environmentally Conscious TQM (ECTQM) where TQM is within ldquoDesign for Environmentrdquo.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the vehicle recognition method based on the SURF algorithm and Bayesian classification model. This method is robust for it overcomes the problems of picture quality and shooting angle. Through the unsupervised Bayesian machine learning method, the vehicle type of unknown pictures can be recognized and fallen under the best matching type. The result shows that the vehicle rate is between 60% and 70%. When the number of feature points is between 180 and 210, we get the best result. The scale of training set is extremely important for perfecting the feature point information. Generally think, the training set is the bigger, the better.},
