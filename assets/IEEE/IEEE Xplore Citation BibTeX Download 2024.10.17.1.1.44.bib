  abstract={One argument in the discussion about the adoption of UML in industry is the supposedly large effort it takes to do modeling. Our study explores how the creation of UML models can be understood to consist of different cognitive activities: (i) designing: thinking about the design (ideation, key-design decision making), (ii) notation expression: expressing a design in a modeling notation and (iii) layouting: the spatial organization of model elements in a diagram. We explain that these different subactivities relate to different short-term and long-term benefits of modeling. In this study we present two controlled experiments with a total of 100 subjects creating models for a small system. In these experiments we focus on software models as represented through UML class diagram. Our results show that at least 56% of the effort spent on creating a class model is actually due to designing. Notation expression is around 41% of the model creation effort and layouting is in the order of 3%. This finding suggests that a significant part of creating models is devoted to design thinking about the problem.},

  volume={},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Large language models (LLMs) are being criticized for copyright infringement, inadvertent bias in training data, a danger to human innovation, the possibility of distributing incorrect or misleading information, and prejudice. Due to their popularity among students, the introduction of many comparable apps, and the inability to resist unfair and fraudulent student usage, their educational use needs to be adapted and harmonized. The incorporation of LLMs should be defined not only by pedagogues and educational institutions, but also by students who will actively utilize them to learn and prepare assignments. In order to find out what students from two universities think and suggest about LLMs use in education, they were asked to give their contribution by answering the survey that was conducted at the beginning of the spring semester of academic 2022/23. Their feedback was quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed, showing in a better light what students think about LLMs and how and why they would use them. Based on the analysis, the authors propose an original strategy for integrating LLMs into education. The proposed approach is also adapted for those students who are not interested in using LLMs and for those who prefer the hybrid mode by combining their own research with LLMs generated recommendations. The authors expect that by implementing the proposed strategy, schools will benefit from a better education in which research, creativity, academic honesty, recognition of false information, and the ability to improve knowledge will prevail.},

  abstract={Previous terrorist attacks, system failures and natural disasters have revealed the problems that many States face in preparing for national civil contingencies. The diversity of critical infrastructures and the interconnections between different systems makes it difficult for planners to 'think of everything'. For example, the loss of power distribution networks can disrupt rail and road transportation systems. Knock-on effects can also be felt across telecommunications infrastructures as the uninterruptible power supplies (UPS') that protect Internet routers and mobile phone base stations fail over time. Domestic water supplies are affected when pumping and treatment centres lose power. These interconnections make it hard to anticipate the many different safety-related systems that might be affected by particular contingencies. This paper introduces a Geographic Information System that is intended to help government agencies plan for the knock-on effects that propagate between major infrastructures. The intention is to provide a flexible system, which can easily be configured and updated. This is important given that technical innovation and routine maintenance continually introduce changes across national infrastructures.},

  year={2008},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Previous terrorist attacks, infrastructure failures and natural disasters have revealed the problems that states face in preparing for civil contingencies. One aspect of this is that the agencies which typically coordinate the protection of critical infrastructures have a national responsibility. However, the impact of particular failures is often focused at a local or regional level. For example, Hurricane Katrina was most acutely felt in the City of New Orleans (over 350,000 people affected), with concentrations in suburban Jefferson Parish (175,000) and St. Bernard Parish (53,000) and along the Mississippi Coast (54,000). The terrorist attacks of 2001 and the UK floods of 2007 also show how multiple localised contingencies can occur at the same time. National infrastructure protection agencies must, therefore, be prepared to provide simultaneous help to multiple local agencies. It is for this reason that national civil protection bodies provide national guidance but then devolve responsibility for the implementation of contingency plans to a local level. Unfortunately, many of the regional groups who are responsible for infrastructure protection have little or no idea about the detailed inter-relationships that exist between their own local infrastructures. For example, in the UK 'risk registers' enumerate local hazards without considering how, for example, an attack on a gas storage facility might damage power distribution infrastructures. Nor do they consider the knock-on effects that such damage might have upon water pumping and purification systems. This paper introduces a geographic information system that is intended to help identify dependencies between local critical infrastructures. Although we focus on supporting interaction between local and national contingency planning within the United Kingdom, similar problems affect many other nations. The goal is to support the 'joined up' thinking that is often recommended in the aftermath of previous failures.},

  abstract={Existing studies on the propagation of infectious diseases have not sufficiently considered the uncertainties that are related to individual behavior and its influence on individual decision making to prevent infections, even though it is well known that changes in behavior can lead to variations in the macrodynamics of the spread of infectious diseases. These influencing factors can be categorized into emotion-related and cognition-related components. We present a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) denotative model to describe how the factors of individual emotions and cognition influence each other. We adjust the weight matrix of causal relationships between these factors by using a so-called nonlinear Hebbian learning method. Based on this FCM model, we can implement individual decision rules against possible infections for disease propagation studies. We take the simulation of influenza A [H1N1] spreading on a campus as an example. We find that individual decision making against infections (frequent washing, respirator usage, and crowd contact avoidance) can significantly decrease the at-peak number of infected patients, even when common policies, such as isolation and vaccination, are not deployed.},

In order to develop efficient technology for effective energy extraction from a solar PV system, this paper investigates and compares typical maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control strategies used in solar PV industry. This paper focuses especially on how sampling rate and time delay influence PV system performance by using different MPPT control approaches in a digital control environment, and how different MPPT techniques behave under highly dynamic and variable weather conditions. A computational experiment system is developed by using MatLab, SimPowerSystems and Opal-RT real-time simulation system for fast and accurate performance evaluations of PV arrays under high frequency switching conditions of power converters. Advantages, disadvantages, and characteristics of different MPPT techniques are studied, evaluated, and compared through extensive computational experiments.},

  year={2022},
  volume={16},
  number={1},
  pages={24-35},
  abstract={In this paper, we propose a lightweight neural network for real-time electrocardiogram (ECG) anomaly detection and system level power reduction of wearable Internet of Things (IoT) Edge sensors. The proposed network utilizes a novel hybrid architecture consisting of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). The LSTM block takes a sequence of coefficients representing the morphology of ECG beats while the MLP input layer is fed with features derived from instantaneous heart rate. Simultaneous training of the blocks pushes the overall network to learn distinct features complementing each other for making decisions. The network was evaluated in terms of accuracy, computational complexity, and power consumption using data from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. To address the class imbalance in the dataset, we augmented the dataset using SMOTE algorithm for network training. The network achieved an average classification accuracy of 97% across several records in the database. Further, the network was mapped to a fixed point model, retrained in a bit accurate fixed-point environment to compensate for the quantization error, and ported to an ARM Cortex M4 based embedded platform. In laboratory testing, the overall system was successfully demonstrated, and a significant saving of $\simeq \!\! 50\%$ power was achieved by gating the wireless transmission using the classifier. Wireless transmission was enabled only to transmit the beats deemed anomalous by the classifier. The proposed technique compares favourably with current methods in terms of computational complexity and has the advantage of stand-alone operation in the edge node, without the need for always-on wireless connectivity making it ideal for IoT wearable devices.},

  abstract={Computational thinking has become an essential skill nowadays. Many educational institutions around the world have adopted computational thinking as an elementary or complementary subject in their teaching schedules. One of the approaches that is efficient in teaching and learning computational thinking has been visual programming. However, like other applications used daily, visual programming tools can be a limiting factor for the blind in learning computational thinking. This work aims to present the iVProg4all, an accessible visual programming system based on forms. A preliminary study was carried out to test the usability of iVProg4all and accessibility with a blind user. The results show that, although some usability issues need to be fixed, the system proved accessible for blind people.},

  pages={95109-95122},
  abstract={Classifying the cognitive levels of assessment questions according to Bloom’s taxonomy can help instructors design effective assessments that are well aligned with the intended learning outcomes. However, the classification process is time consuming and requires experience. Many studies have attempted to automate the process by utilizing different machine learning and text mining approaches, but none has examined the classification of Arabic questions. The purpose of this study is to examine this research gap and to introduce a new feature extraction method that would better suit Arabic questions and their unique characteristics. It also aims to provide Arab instructors with a tool that can help them automatically classify their assessment questions. To accomplish this purpose, the study developed a dataset of more than 600 Arabic assessment questions. It then proposed a modified term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) method for extracting features from Arabic questions. Unlike the traditional TF-IDF, the proposed method was designed to take the nature of assessment questions into consideration. It was evaluated by comparing it to two methods that have been used for classifying English questions, i.e., the traditional TF-IDF and a modified TF-IDF method called term frequency part-of-speech-inverse document frequency (TFPOS-IDF). A t-test was utilized to examine whether the difference in performance between the three methods was statistically significant. The proposed method outperformed the two other methods. The overall accuracy, precision, and recall scored by the proposed method were significantly higher than those scored by the traditional TF-IDF and TFPOS-IDF methods. The evaluation results indicate the promising potential of the proposed method, which can be extended to other languages.},

  pages={76991-77008},
  abstract={Higher education confers numerous benefits both to the individual and to society, including higher earnings, lower rates of unemployment and government dependency, an increased tax base, and greater civic engagement. Access to higher education remains a challenge for many families. The emergence of Industry 4.0 will not only affect technological changes but also people in the labour market. As such, higher education institutions with academic responsibilities of formally training students to better adapt to such changes are not left out. Since the introduction of the Master of Business Administration (MBA) in the United States of America in 1908 and over one hundred years of history, this prestigious programme has suffered a rapid decline in enrolments worldwide. Thus, it has gradually lost its value under the current industrial revolution. This paper evaluates and prioritizes barriers affecting the decline in international MBA enrolments. Understanding the key barriers to MBA enrolments regarding the dynamics will contribute to the successful implementation of those barriers. With scarce information, this study innovatively applies the grey incidence analysis (GIA) method to prioritizing the identified barriers. When applied, this method provided a robust prediction of results. For international MBA enrolments decline, the barrier “employment difficulties” (H3) should receive much attention from policymakers because it scored the highest among the barriers ranked. Further, other important barriers that should be considered are “lack of entrepreneurship skills” (H11), “high cost” (H10), “longer payback duration” (H1), “10 yr. ROI” (H9), and “lack of data analytic skills” (H7). Therefore, during the formulation and implementation of policy to address these prioritized barriers, scarce resources must be committed to them. This paper also contributes to the literature a first-hand, formal study on the prioritization of barriers to international MBA enrolments.},

  abstract={Business and data understanding, that aims to identify multiple mining tasks, is the most primary phase in planning a practical data mining project. However, traditional tasks determination problem could only be solved by experienced analysts, which suffers from high communication cost and low efficiency. In this paper, we study the automatic task discovery method following the problem solving theory. First, we establish the concept network (CN) model to represent human knowledge and experience in the problem solving process. Then, we propose and demonstrate the structure of two major mining tasks (clustering and classification) in a CN. Finally, a data mining tasks discovery method (DMTD) is put forward, followed by two analysis subject evaluation algorithms. Experiment results illustrate that the DMTD is able to discover all the potential mining tasks from a predefined concept network, filtered by the important or interesting analysis subjects. Moreover, these tasks defined by the DMTD are proven to be available and valuable by fifty published papers.},

  pages={102261-102273},
  abstract={In the dynamic landscape of contemporary education, the evolution of teaching strategies such as blended learning and flipped classrooms has highlighted the need for efficient and effective generation of multiple-choice questions (MCQs). To address this, we introduce MCQGen, a novel generative artificial intelligence framework designed for the automated creation of MCQs. MCQGen uniquely integrates a large language model (LLM) with retrieval-augmented generation and advanced prompt engineering techniques, drawing from an extensive external knowledge base. This integration significantly enhances the ability of the LLM to produce educationally relevant questions that align with both the goals of educators and the diverse learning needs of students. The framework employs innovative prompt engineering, combining chain-of-thought and self-refine prompting techniques, to enhance the performance of the LLM. This process leads to the generation of questions that are not only contextually relevant and challenging but also reflective of common student misconceptions, contributing effectively to personalized learning experiences and enhancing student engagement and understanding. Our extensive evaluations showcase the effectiveness of MCQGen in producing high-quality MCQs for various educational needs and learning styles. The framework demonstrates its potential to significantly reduce the time and expertise required for MCQ creation, marking its practical utility in modern education. In essence, MCQGen offers an innovative and robust solution for the automated generation of MCQs, enhancing personalized learning in the digital era.},

  pages={581-586},
  abstract={This study explains the design and implementation of a Virtual Reality (VR) framework for `fun-based' interactive programming instruction in engineering education courses. Students continue to face several difficulties when learning programming [1] and the lack of efficient tools to overcome such difficulties can affect the students' motivation [2]. Over time, this creates a drastic and negative impact in their attitude towards `learning programming,' which is undesirable for student success in engineering education. To rectify this, a suitable approach that can motivate students needs to be developed to change students' mindset towards learning programming. Student motivation is considered imperative as it is directly influences a student's perseverance and dedication towards accomplishing an objective [3]. Rather than viewing programming courses as a means to complete coursework requirements, students should be made to realize the `power of programming.' Learning and gaining experience in computer programming necessarily involves the development of computational/critical thinking and problem solving skills. All these skills sharpen the minds of the students while simultaneously opening up multiple job prospects for them upon graduation. To this end, to facilitate interactive and fun-filled learning, this research employs a learner-centric, user-friendly Virtual Environment (VE) to teach programming concepts. In doing so, this research aims to make a paradigm shift in the `approach to teaching and learning programming.'},

The increased popularity of social media amongst college students makes it an opportune time to consider a new form of literacy based on how technology is used by students, the devices that students interact with on a daily bases and the mainstream acceptance of social media in daily life. In order to retain students in computing classes, students are taught in an efficacious manner how to capitalize on the technology that they use on a daily basis. By increasing their SDL proficiency to become a more informed student, a well versed employee and consciously aware of what they post to social media.

  abstract={Research has identified multiple reasons why people do end-user programming but has yet to quantify one of the most basic: making more money. This is an important gap in the literature given the current widespread efforts to promote computational thinking skills, because this education campaign is often linked to the argument that end-user programming skills will contribute to workers' long-term career prospects. Therefore, this paper presents a study investigating how the earnings of workers varied as a function of whether they used spreadsheets/databases and/or did programming at work. Examining survey data from 2003 revealed a positive correlation of earnings against these variables, even after controlling for the occupations of workers. Overall, occupation-adjusted earnings were 14% higher for workers who used spreadsheets/databases and who also did programming, versus those who did neither. These results provoke numerous questions for future research regarding what financial benefits workers can expect to obtain in different settings through end-user programming.},

Its popularity is coming from its operation is very close to the human thinking. Although, it has high computational needs. Final step of the conventional model is the defuzzification, where a crisp value is assigned to the aggregated result of the system to represent it. This value should be selected in such a way as to best represent the result of the evaluation. For this reason, to select the best fitted defuzzification method is essential. In this paper two of the commonly used defuzzification methods are introduced, and a correction value is proposed to improve the result of MOM (Mean of Maxima) defuzzification method. The proposed modification was studied both in the conventional Mamdani, and Mamdani-like model using discretized output.},

  abstract={The appearance of MOOCs has boosted the creation of educational material for use in all possible contexts. However, this material is often created without much thought and without proper tools and methodologies. Much more attention should be placed on the design of educational material, since this is the basis for a successful learning experience. In this special session, we report about several interesting approaches towards the design and creation of educational material that range from the call to the definition of a discipline of Courseware Engineering, to a methodology for video recording, another one for the creation of smart adaptive content, tools metrics for teaching computational thinking, the integration of OERs, and the design and application of game-based material.},

  abstract={In this paper, we propose the computational rule inferences to tackle the presumptive rate of aggregative risk in fuzzy circumstances. The proposed method of presumptive rate of aggregative risk directly uses the fuzzy numbers rather than the linguistic values to presume. The presumptive rate is close to the human thinking.},

  abstract={Granular computing is an emerging conceptual and computing paradigm of information processing. Just as a great umbrella, it may be regarded as a label of theories, methodologies, techniques, and tools that make use of information granules. Extension set theory is a new computational method of knowledge resolution and the significance of attribute. Extension method can be used to describe the thinking process associated with both quantitative change and qualitative change. In this paper, we integrate granular computing with extension method. We utilize the extension method to solve some problems for communicating between information granular worlds. The communication procedures between information granular worlds based on extension method can be established, which is valuable and easy to implement in computer.},

  abstract={The program “Introduction to programming in the first cycle of basic education” initiated in 2015 has provided the opportunity to develop computational thinking and digital literacy among students. The existing literature suggests that Scratch programming language may have a strong influence on the skills acquired by students in classroom. In this context, it is intended to build an intervention with objectives that fit into the Student Profile leaving compulsory education and developed within the scope of curricular flexibility, recommended for the 1st year of basic education. The applied methodology aims to evaluate the impact on students' knowledge (mathematics and mother tongue), attitudes (in relation to knowledge and citizenship) and on the capacities (cognitive, emotional and practical) as well as in the school community (students, teachers and families).},

  abstract={With the rapid development of science and technology over the world, programming education has shown as a trend in decades. Programming courses have been offered in primary education to promote students’ computational thinking skills. However, teaching and learning programming in primary schools involve different knowledge including complex mathematical concepts and programming syntax. Also, traditional teaching methods may not effectively cater for students’ individual needs and learning trajectories. Thus, learning difficulties are common among students. Teachers keep examining innovation on programming education to improve their teaching. This study investigated used a pretest-posttest method with two groups of grade five students in Macao, to compare the influence of two pedagogical strategies, flipped classroom and traditional teaching, in students’ learning achievements. The major findings of the study showed that the experimental group in flipped classroom had significantly higher learning achievements than the control group in the programming course. Moreover, the students in the flipped classroom showed a significant effective mastery of more complex programming concepts, such as conditions and loops.},
