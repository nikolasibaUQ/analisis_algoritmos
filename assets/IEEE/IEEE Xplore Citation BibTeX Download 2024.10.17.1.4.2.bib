  abstract={Near-peer mentoring has proven to be an effective strategy for supporting students from underrepresented groups in computing. In this paper, we present results from Rise Up and Sisters Rise Up to examine the experiences of mentors in near-peer mentoring programs. Rise Up and Sisters Rise Up are mentoring program initiatives that help secondary students from underrepresented groups succeed in their Advanced Placement Computer Science courses and exams. Drawing on the results from a mixed-method study, we focus on the experiences of mentors to address the following research question: How do near-peer mentoring experiences impact mentors' competency beliefs related to programming, mentoring, and culturally responsive teaching? Findings from the analysis of survey and interview data indicate that serving as a near-peer mentor reinforced mentors' prior programming knowledge, increased their programming self-efficacy beliefs, and prompted self-reflection on the purpose of mentoring relationships. In addition to these benefits, the results also revealed the need to provide mentors with continued opportunities to build mentoring competencies and practice culturally responsive teaching strategies. We conclude by discussing future work to improve our mentor training and further develop a mutually beneficial near-peer mentoring model for computing education that supports the development of mentors, as well as mentees.},

  abstract={Multihop knowledge reasoning aims to find missing entities for incomplete triples by finding paths on knowledge graphs. It is a fundamental and important task. In this article, we devise a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm to model the reasoning process more effectively. Unlike existing methods directly reason on entities and relations, we adopt a high-level reasoning layer to deal with abstract concepts, which guides the reasoning process conducted at the low level for concrete entities and relations. Our approach yields competitive results on link prediction on both NELL-995 and FB15k-237 datasets. The comparison to baselines also demonstrates the effectiveness of the hierarchical structure.},

  pages={2521-2534},
  abstract={We present a new method to efficiently generate a set of morphologically diverse and inspiring virtual trees through hierarchical topology-preserving blending, aiming to facilitate designers' creativity production. By maintaining the topological consistency of the tree branches, sequences of similar yet different trees and novel intermediate trees with encouragingly interesting structures are generated by performing inner-species and cross-species blending, respectively. Hierarchical fuzzy correspondences are automatically established between two or multiple trees based on the multi-scale topology tree representations. Fundamental blending tasks including morph, grow and wilt are introduced and organized into a tree-structured blending scheduler, which not only introduces the randomness into the blending procedure but also wisely schedules the tasks to generate topology-aware blending sequences, contributing to a variety of resulting trees that exhibit diversities in both geometry and topology. Most significantly, multiple batches of blending can be executed in parallel, resulting in a rapid creation of a large repository of diverse trees.},

  title={Visual Analysis of Hyperproperties for Understanding Model Checking Results}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={28},
  number={1},
  pages={357-367},
  abstract={Model checkers provide algorithms for proving that a mathematical model of a system satisfies a given specification. In case of a violation, a counterexample that shows the erroneous behavior is returned. Understanding these counterexamples is challenging, especially for hyperproperty specifications, i.e., specifications that relate multiple executions of a system to each other. We aim to facilitate the visual analysis of such counterexamples through our HyperVis tool, which provides interactive visualizations of the given model, specification, and counterexample. Within an iterative and interdisciplinary design process, we developed visualization solutions that can effectively communicate the core aspects of the model checking result. Specifically, we introduce graphical representations of binary values for improving pattern recognition, color encoding for better indicating related aspects, visually enhanced textual descriptions, as well as extensive cross-view highlighting mechanisms. Further, through an underlying causal analysis of the counterexample, we are also able to identify values that contributed to the violation and use this knowledge for both improved encoding and highlighting. Finally, the analyst can modify both the specification of the hyperproperty and the system directly within HyperVis and initiate the model checking of the new version. In combination, these features notably support the analyst in understanding the error leading to the counterexample as well as iterating the provided system and specification. We ran multiple case studies with HyperVis and tested it with domain experts in qualitative feedback sessions. The participants' positive feedback confirms the considerable improvement over the manual, text-based status quo and the value of the tool for explaining hyperproperties.},

  abstract={Background: Data breaches happen when an unauthorized party gains access to personally identifiable information. They are becoming more common and impactful, raising serious concerns for individuals as well as companies. Literature review: Although there is considerable literature on users’ mental models in security and privacy, there has been limited study of mental models related to data breaches. Research questions: 1. How do users understand data breaches? 2. What are their perceptions of the causes, responsibilities, and consequences, as well as possible prevention and appropriate follow up? Methodology: We explored end-user understanding of internet data breaches by conducting a study with 35 participants. They were asked to draw their understanding of data breaches and answer some open-ended and closed-ended questions afterwards. Results/discussion: Although their drawings varied in detail and complexity, we identified four patterns in the participants’ drawings: they illustrated abstractions of attacks to gain administrator access, end-user access, backdoor access, or access using database server vulnerabilities. We found that participants had a basic model of how an internet data breach happens, but with significant uncertainties regarding system vulnerabilities, causes, consequences, prevention methods, and follow-up steps after a breach. Conclusions: In all, end-user mental models of internet data breaches are basic and show gaps that emphasize the need for improved communication to increase users’ awareness and help them hold companies accountable.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={3250-3259},
  abstract={Automatically generating medical reports from retinal images is a difficult task in which an algorithm must generate semantically coherent descriptions for a given retinal image. Existing methods mainly rely on the input image to generate descriptions. However, many abstract medical concepts or descriptions cannot be generated based on image information only. In this work, we integrate additional information to help solve this task; we observe that early in the diagnosis process, ophthalmologists have usually written down a small set of keywords denoting important information. These keywords are then subsequently used to aid the later creation of medical reports for a patient. Since these keywords commonly exist and are useful for generating medical reports, we incorporate them into automatic report generation. Since we have two types of inputs expert-defined unordered keywords and images - effectively fusing features from these different modalities is challenging. To that end, we propose a new keyword-driven medical report generation method based on a non-local attention-based multi-modal feature fusion approach, TransFuser, which is capable of fusing features from different types of inputs based on such attention. Our experiments show the proposed method successfully captures the mutual information of keywords and image content. We further show our proposed keyword-driven generation model reinforced by the TransFuser is superior to baselines under the popular text evaluation metrics BLEU, CIDEr, and ROUGE.

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Cognitive load primarily depends on how an individual perceives, assimilates and responds to an external stimulus. We intend to create Electroencephalogram (EEG) models for the cognitive skills defined in the Bloom's taxonomy using low cost, commercial EEG devices. This could be applied in educational psychology to provide individual assistance according to one's learning style and abilities. The major challenge in using low resolution EEG device lies in signal analysis with reduced number of channels. In this paper, we present the signature of EEG signals for such low cost devices using three basic tasks namely, number matching; finding characters in text; finding hidden patterns and figures. These tasks map with understand, remember and analyze sub categories of Bloom's taxonomy. Different brain regions are activated while performing the above tasks. However, the EEG signals observed on the scalp are the manifestation of the combined effects of various brain regions. The cleaned EEG signals are analyzed using unsupervised clustering of features obtained from different frequency bands. A study is performed on 10 subjects using 14 lead Emotiv neuroheadset, so that one can get further insights on how an individual perceives certain cognitive tasks.},

  title={ConceptExplainer: Interactive Explanation for Deep Neural Networks from a Concept Perspective}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={29},
  number={1},
  pages={831-841},
  abstract={Traditional deep learning interpretability methods which are suitable for model users cannot explain network behaviors at the global level and are inflexible at providing fine-grained explanations. As a solution, concept-based explanations are gaining attention due to their human intuitiveness and their flexibility to describe both global and local model behaviors. Concepts are groups of similarly meaningful pixels that express a notion, embedded within the network's latent space and have commonly been hand-generated, but have recently been discovered by automated approaches. Unfortunately, the magnitude and diversity of discovered concepts makes it difficult to navigate and make sense of the concept space. Visual analytics can serve a valuable role in bridging these gaps by enabling structured navigation and exploration of the concept space to provide concept-based insights of model behavior to users. To this end, we design, develop, and validate ConceptExplainer, a visual analytics system that enables people to interactively probe and explore the concept space to explain model behavior at the instance/class/global level. The system was developed via iterative prototyping to address a number of design challenges that model users face in interpreting the behavior of deep learning models. Via a rigorous user study, we validate how ConceptExplainer supports these challenges. Likewise, we conduct a series of usage scenarios to demonstrate how the system supports the interactive analysis of model behavior across a variety of tasks and explanation granularities, such as identifying concepts that are important to classification, identifying bias in training data, and understanding how concepts can be shared across diverse and seemingly dissimilar classes.},

  abstract={Modeling is a creative activity known and practiced by most in industry, government, and academia. A model is a construct of language coded using different technologies-from print and physical media to computer-generated synthetic environments. The activity of modeling is so central to human cognition, that we must ask ourselves whether modeling should be more clearly emphasized in education, especially within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Coding has recently been suggested as a skill that everyone needs to acquire for the 21st Century. Can modeling be situated along side coding? We explore the connections between modeling and coding, and stress the importance of model literacy for all.},

  abstract={Learning by different ways as well as learning by discovery is natural. Especially in early childhood, we learn mostly by experience. Educational activities designed to acquire knowledge from experience lead students (pupils) to make own abstract or mental models only after finishing the activity. According to our experience, we should conclude that learners really learn from their attempts and mistakes even at computer science classes. Their disengagement should be reduced by the involvement of something personally significant. Teachers should ensure that activities are designed and carried out in ways that offer each learner the chance to engage in the manner that suits them to the best. The paper describes selected computer science activities that should be used to engage the pupils or students in the learning process. We conclude that relatively simple teaching aid could help to explain even abstract computer science underlying concepts through the experience sometimes more effectively than through instructional model.},

  abstract={Selecting the desired ontology from a collection of available ones is essential for ontology reuse. We address the problem of evaluating, ranking and selecting ontologies according to user preferences. We exploit the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to solve the multiple-criteria decision problem and to model the preferences of the users. We use AHP to analyze the available ontologies from different perspectives and at different abstraction levels. The decision is based on the concrete end-node measurements and their relative importance at higher levels. For supporting the selection decision, we developed an ontology representation, reasoning and management system. The system applies different metrics on ontologies in order to feed the Analytic Hierarchy Process with facts. The running scenario applies our method to the task of reusing ontologies from the tourism domain.},

  abstract={Despite recent advances in text-to-3D generative methods, there is a notable absence of reliable evaluation metrics. Existing metrics usually focus on a single criterion each, such as how well the asset aligned with the input text. These metrics lack the flexibility to generalize to different evaluation criteria and might not align well with human preferences. Conducting user preference studies is an alternative that offers both adaptability and human-aligned results. User studies, however, can be very ex-pensive to scale. This paper presents an automatic, ver-satile, and human-aligned evaluation metric for text-to-3D generative models. To this end, we first develop a prompt generator using GPT-4V to generate evaluating prompts, which serve as input to compare text-to-3D models. We further design a method instructing GPT-4V to compare two 3D assets according to user-defined crite-ria. Finally, we use these pairwise comparison results to assign these models Elo ratings. Experimental results suggest our metric strongly aligns with human preference across different evaluation criteria. Our code is available at https://github.com/3DTopia/GPTEval3D.},

The contemporary seeker has something the others lacked, technical advancements and knowledge. With the advent of AI, it was only natural that man used this tool to try and achieve this long-sought desire.

  abstract={This paper has proposed a novel authentication solution for the MapReduce (MR) model, a new distributed and parallel computing paradigm commonly deployed to process Big Data by major IT players, such as Facebook and Yahoo. It identifies a set of security, performance, and scalability requirements that are specified from a comprehensive study of a job execution process using MR and security threats and attacks in this environment. Based on the requirements, it critically analyzes the state-of-the-art authentication solutions, discovering that the authentication services currently proposed for the MR model is not adequate. This paper then presents a novel layered authentication solution for the MR model and describes the core components of this solution, which includes the virtual domain based authentication framework (VDAF). These novel ideas are significant, because, first, the approach embeds the characteristics of MR-in-cloud deployments into security solution designs, and this will allow the MR model be delivered as a software as a service in a public cloud environment along with our proposed authentication solution; second, VDAF supports the authentication of every interactions by any MR components involved in a job execution flow, so long as the interactions are for accessing resources of the job; third, this continuous authentication service is provided in such a manner that the costs incurred in providing the authentication service should be as low as possible.},

  abstract={Security is a critical aspect in the process of designing, developing, and testing software systems. Due to the increasing need for security-related skills within software systems, there is a growing demand for these skills to be taught in computer science. A series of security modules was developed not only to meet the demand but also to assess the impact of these modules on teaching critical cyber security topics in computer science courses. This full paper in the innovative practice category presents the outcomes of six security modules in a freshman-level course at two institutions. The study adopts a Model-Eliciting Activity (MEA) as a project for students to demonstrate an understanding of the security concepts. Two experimental studies were conducted: 1) Teaching effectiveness of implementing cyber security modules and MEA project, 2) Students’ experiences in conceptual modeling tasks in problem-solving. In measuring the effectiveness of teaching security concepts with the MEA project, students’ performance, attitudes, and interests as well as the instructor’s effectiveness were assessed. For the conceptual modeling tasks in problem-solving, the results of student outcomes were analyzed. After implementing the security modules with the MEA project, students showed a great understanding of cyber security concepts and an increased interest in broader computer science concepts. The instructor’s beliefs about teaching, learning, and assessment shifted from teacher-centered to student-centered during their experience with the security modules and MEA project. Although 64.29% of students’ solutions do not seem suitable for real-world implementation, 76.9% of the developed solutions showed a sufficient degree of creativity.},

  abstract={While service-oriented paradigm plays a more and more extensive role in software and information systems development and service-driven architectures are increasingly adopted by public and private organizations, the Requirements Engineering (RE) discipline still fails to provide approaches and techniques dedicated for this type of development. In this paper we aim to identify viewpoints and issues particular to the RE domain adapted to the service-oriented engineering context. Based on this analysis, we introduce a framework to support RE for service engineering.},

  abstract={Autonomic unit is the essential element and the most basic component of autonomic systems. Having the ability of handling emotions is considered to make autonomic unit more intelligent, more communicative and more social. In this article we try to build an emotion model for agents that act as autonomic units in autonomic systems and can self-manage its behavior to achieve the best performance. From four levels we define four models progressively and the top-level model is defined on the foundation of the three below, combining them as a unity. By given arousing axioms theoretically of several typical emotions, the model is proved to be effective for reasoning emotions of autonomic unit, and can be easily extended for dealing with other type of emotions. On this base an architecture of emotional autonomic unit is described. An example shows that emotion plays an important role in intelligent decision making, which proves the validity of the model and the special function in practice.},

  abstract={A cyberculture of social computing is proposed that integrates technologies of exhaustive human-free metric monitoring and digital management of social processes and phenomena. Logical structures of cyber social computing are defined, which are considered as components of cyber technologies for accurate monitoring and moral digital management of society. The types of emotionally logical computing, the metrics and algorithms for measuring social relations along horizontal and vertical communications, the rules of human behavior, focused on the creation of emotional logic for modeling and predicting people's behavior. A cyber-physical model of digital statehood is introduced for metric management of resources and citizens based on exhaustive monitoring of people's needs, including components of social computing (attitudes, goals, management, personnel, infrastructure, resources) ordered by their impact on market success. The cyber social architecture of the moral digital management of science and resources is offered based on exhaustive metric monitoring of educational processes.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a framework for non-equilibrium behavior analysis in cyber-physical systems for security purposes. To categorize the player, we employ the principles of reinforcement learning in order to derive an iterative method of optimal responses that determine the policy of an agent with level-k intelligence in a general non-zerosum, nonlinear environment. For the special case of zero-sum, linear quadratic games we derive appropriate non-equilibrium game Riccati equations. To obviate the need for complete knowledge of the system dynamics, we employ a Q-learning algorithm as a best response solver. We then design an estimator that determines the distribution of intelligence levels in the adversarial environment of the system. Finally, simulation results showcase the efficacy of our approach.},
