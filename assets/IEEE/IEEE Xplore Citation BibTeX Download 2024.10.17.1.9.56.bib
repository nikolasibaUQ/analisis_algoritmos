  abstract={The public opinion formation is becoming of a strategic importance at all levels of society. Public voice, a consequence of an asymmetrical informational structure, is interwoven by viewpoints of many individuals involved in the issue. The control and possible handling to manipulate information are now major issues in social organizations, including economy, politics, fashion, and even personal affairs. This paper focuses on simulation of the public voice diffusing based on the social mechanisms at individual level. At first, an analysis was performed to establish a multi-agent-based model analogous to a cellular automata model; it incorporated the variables of individual characters and other individualspsila impact to describe the thinking process of individuals, when they were confronted with the public voice. The attributes and hypothesizes referred in the model would be detailed in this section. Then another analyses followed further examine the functions of some parameters and mechanisms in the public voice forming, based on simulation experiments and sensitivity analysis. Finally, exploratory discussions and limitations on the model were presented.},

  abstract={A lot of data are collected through various kind of sensors and devices and can be used to make business strategy. These are sometimes used in business and marketing. In existing convention management research and its business research, most of contributions provide the result of analyses of surveys using answer of questionnaire or interviews from convention attendees, event planners and several other stakeholders. If we can know attendees' behavior, perception, and thinking by collecting data from sensors, digital voice recorders and cameras, the management and business design can be designed based on the analysis in order to improve the quality of service and attendee's satisfaction. In this paper, we explain what convention attendees expect to attend the conventions. We show our preliminary experiments to collect attendees' behavior data in a convention. Then, we propose an improved design on experiment environment to acquire attendees' data in convention. We propose a refined model of convention management research and business process in the end of this paper. In our proposed research and business process on convention management, a lot of types acquired data from sensors set in convention facility and can promise to design an improved service to enhance attendees' satisfaction in convention.},

  abstract={The objective of this essay is to provide the beginning of a principled classification of some of the ways space is intelligently used. Studies of planning have typically focused on the temporal ordering of action, leaving as unaddressed, questions of where to lay down instruments, ingredients, work-in-progress, and the like. But, in having a body, we are spatially located creatures: we must always he facing some direction, have only certain objects in view, be within reach of certain others. How we manage the spatial arrangement of items around us, is not an afterthought; it is an integral part of the way we think, plan and behave. The proposed classification has three main categories: spatial arrangements that simplify choice; spatial arrangements that simplify perception; and spatial dynamics that simplify internal computation. The data for such a classification is drawn from videos of cooking, assembly and packing, everyday observations in supermarkets, workshops and playrooms, and experimental studies of subjects playing Tetris, the computer game. This study, therefore, focusses on interactive processes in the medium and short term: on how agents set up their workplace for particular tasks, and how they continuously manage that workplace.},

  year={2013},

  pages={144-149},
  abstract={Many successful methods for image classification transform low-level descriptors into mid-level features, and obtain a compact and discriminative representation. However, these approaches rarely think about the spatial context information between mid-level features. In this paper, we present a new mixed-order structural (MOS) representation which may generalize the widely used method spatial pyramid representation (SPR) with correlation modeling method. We first partition the image following SP and extract the mid-level feature for each spatial region. Then our MOS consists of 0th and 1st - order correlation model based on mid-level features. The 0th- order correlation can answer what the mid-level feature represents, and the 1-th order corresponds to spatial contextual information in ambient neighbors. In addition, we apply principal component analysis to reduce the dimension of mid-level features which makes our MOS can be a relatively low dimensionality. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed MOS representation achieves a better performance compared with spatial pyramid matching (SPM) and other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract={This Neumann’s last publication marks the beginning of a comparison between artificial and natural information processing machines that has continued ever since, that is, the comparison of “The Computer and the Brain”. With a brief description of the book, we prepare the formulation of the new tasks of the comparison. In doing so, the revolutionary change that took place in the infosphere of humanity with the co-evolution of computing, networking and representing information, and which is still in intensive development, must be taken into account. The book contrasts the stored program architecture based on Neumann’s principle with the neural network architecture of the brain. The numerical comparison is based on differences in the performance, number, and density of the active elements. The comparison cannot be continued in this way, because we are not dealing with individual computers, but with a system of cooperating machines organized in the Internet. The worlds of the two kinds of machines jointly use the latest collection of artificially created information carriers, the Data Sphere, and together they form the active information processing component of the Humanity’s infosphere. The carriers of information provide the common, materially existing object of computation and thinking, which I call formation in the paper. The information event, introduced in the paper, associate formation with information. Formation means information when the observation or creation of the formation in an information event is connected to the meaning for its owner. While the information processing of computers is only the transformation of formations, the assignment of meaning is carried on in an information event both before and after the transformation. In the most important information event, the owner is the human mind. The separating barrier between the two worlds is the information event. Within the computer systems, there are no more information events, only formations are transformed, in which the activation of program formations enables the automatic execution of the computation.},

  abstract={When analyzing the Radio Frequency Identification applications, one might think of two essential hierarchies: the structures aiming to offer security to an RFID system and the structures aiming to offer functionality means, with no security issues. One should know precisely the significance of these notions. Radio Frequency Identification represents an advanced wireless technology, which integrates an essential solution within the fields of intelligent chips and automation technologies. In this paper, four protocols based on updating the tags' identifiers by means of RFID readers will be compared, in order to carry out an analysis over the jeopardizing points that threaten the security and privacy of RFID systems. Cryptography signifies a way of creating RFID systems more secure. A chaotic matter is brought into discussion, by the following situations: to find out if it is a protocol of identification or authentication that is necessary, depending on various RFID applications or systems. Such analysis over RFID security has carried out wide thoughts.},

  abstract={The paper aims to present the real current situation of the state of education being provided by various schools in rural areas of the central Indian district of Yavatmal in the state of Maharashtra situated in India. Also, the paper is an attempt to analyze the data using simple analytical tools from an artificial intelligence perspective to predict various parameters indicating the future shape and direction of education is going to in these rural parts of mainland India. The study is based on real survey data collected by visiting numerous schools after receiving written permission from the Block Development Officer of Tehsil Yavatmal. The initial emphasis was on girl education but has been generalized to boys as well because of the coeducation system. The process involved talks on the state of the art of education and collection of data from respective heads of the school followed by interviews with schoolteachers, nonteaching staff, and students. The study is represented in the form of graphs, inferences, and observations on the complicated way ahead, for education to reach these deprived large chunks of people, who think that their future is their children and education is the only key responsible for new light to come to their lives. The paper includes the developmental stages Indian education passed through from pre-independence to recent times.},

  abstract={Addresses the management of health care information technology (HCIT) from a total quality perspective with a focus on associated technologies in radiology and imaging. The aim is to chart a course for the application of these advancing technologies within the context of an integrated delivery system (IDS) to prepare radiologists and other medical technologists facing a rapidly changing health service delivery system. In this context, a critical step is the task of strategic HCIT planning, design and implementation to realize an efficient, appropriate and effective HCIT infrastructure for developing seamless, integrated radiological services. The key factors underlying this challenge in face of rapid advances in radiological and imaging technology are often poorly understood. The concept of a total quality management information technology (TQMIT) model is explored and illustrated. The central theme is to demonstrate how this sort of thinking can be applied philosophically, logically and physically to guide management and radiologists in strategy formulation and in taking critical steps to plan, design and develop high-quality services that will facilitate distributed image processing, information exchange and sharing among multiple health care providers within an IDS.},

  year={2016},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Approximate computing is gaining traction as a computing paradigm for data analytics and cognitive applications that aim to extract deep insight from vast quantities of data. In this paper, we demonstrate that multiple approximation techniques can be applied to applications in these domains and can be further combined together to compound their benefits. In assessing the potential of approximation in these applications, we took the liberty of changing multiple layers of the system stack: architecture, programming model, and algorithms. Across a set of applications spanning the domains of DSP, robotics, and machine learning, we show that hot loops in the applications can be perforated by an average of 50% with proportional reduction in execution time, while still producing acceptable quality of results. In addition, the width of the data used in the computation can be reduced to 10-16 bits from the currently common 32/64 bits with potential for significant performance and energy benefits. For parallel applications we reduced execution time by 50% using relaxed synchronization mechanisms. Finally, our results also demonstrate that benefits compounded when these techniques are applied concurrently. Our results across different applications demonstrate that approximate computing is a widely applicable paradigm with potential for compounded benefits from applying multiple techniques across the system stack. In order to exploit these benefits it is essential to re-think multiple layers of the system stack to embrace approximations ground-up and to design tightly integrated approximate accelerators. Doing so will enable moving the applications into a world in which the architecture, programming model, and even the algorithms used to implement the application are all fundamentally designed for approximate computing.},

  pages={1661-1680},
  abstract={In previous papers, the Fourier transform (FT) has been generalized into the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT), the linear canonical transform (LCT), and the simplified fractional Fourier transform (SFRFT). Because the cosine, sine, and Hartley transforms are very similar to the FT, it is reasonable to think they can also be generalized by the similar way. We introduce several new transforms. They are all the generalization of the cosine, sine, or Hartley transform. We first derive the fractional cosine, sine, and Hartley transforms (FRCT/FRST/FRHT). They are analogous to the FRFT. Then, we derive the canonical cosine and sine transforms (CCT/CST). They are analogous to the LCT. We also derive the simplified fractional cosine, sine, and Hartley transforms (SFRCT/SFRST/SFRHT). They are analogous to the SFRFT and have the advantage of real-input-real-output. We also discuss the properties, digital implementation, and applications (e.g., the applications for filter design and space-variant pattern recognition) of these transforms. The transforms introduced in this paper are very efficient for digital implementation. We can just use one half or one fourth of the real multiplications required for the FRFT and LCT to implement them. When we want to process even, odd, or pure real/imaginary functions, we can use these transforms instead of the FRFT and LCT. Besides, we also show that the FRCT/FRST, CCT/CST, and SFRCT/SFRST are also useful for the one-sided (t /spl isin/ [0, /spl infin/]) signal processing.},

  abstract={The current global emphasis on “Internet of Things (IoT)” have highlighted the extreme importance of sensor-based intelligent and ubiquitous systems which are more commonly known as “cyber-physical systems.” The technology has the potential to create a network of smart devices and things to an extent that has never been envisaged before, far outnumbering the number of devices connected in the Internet as we know today. The sheer number of such connected ubiquitous devices is likely to give rise to a hitherto unforeseen volume of data of different types with a demand for execution of analytical algorithms over the data. On the success of these analytic processes will depend the actual “smartness” of the “Intelligent Infrastructures” which now form the crux of the IoT paradigm. We have seen the advent of cloud-based paradigms to analyse the data in a data-parallel fashion within large data centres which now form the basis of the “big-data” problem. But apart from the servers in the data centres, we potentially have a huge pool of compute resources if we think about the smart devices in and around our homes collectively, which remain relatively idle. In this paper, we present a proposal with some emulated experimental results where we claim that in an IoT framework, the smart devices such as mobile phones, home gateways etc. can be utilised for execution of dataparallel analytic jobs. This is effectively a work-in-progress and it is acknowledged that there will be further challenges for real devices. Future research will attempt to consider these challenges.},

  abstract={Recent discovery of security attacks in advanced processors, known as Spectre and Meltdown, has resulted in high public alertness about security of hardware. The root cause of these attacks is information leakage across covert channels that reveal secret data without any explicit information flow between the secret and the attacker. Many sources believe that such covert channels are intrinsic to highly advanced processor architectures based on speculation and out-of-order execution, suggesting that such security risks can be avoided by staying away from high-end processors. This paper, however, shows that the problem is of wider scope: we present new classes of covert channel attacks which are possible in average-complexity processors with in-order pipelining, as they are mainstream in applications ranging from Internet-of-Things to Autonomous Systems. We present a new approach as a foundation for remedy against covert channels: while all previous attacks were found by clever thinking of human attackers, this paper presents a formal method called Unique Program Execution Checking which detects and locates vulnerabilities to covert channels systematically, including those to covert channels unknown so far.},

  abstract={In the literature, there exist several approaches for monitoring the execution of BPEL processes. They concentrate on different properties, adopt different languages, work at different levels of abstraction, and assume different perspectives. Even if the field is rather new, we do not think that this diversity is a limitation of current solutions; rather it is intrinsic in the problem itself. We claim that, instead of working on the definition of the ultimate approach for BPEL monitoring, we should push a cooperative approach based on the integration of different solutions.In this paper, we present a first step in this direction, and describe a monitoring framework which is obtained by integrating two well-known approaches, namely Dynamo and Astro. This integration, which happens both for the language used for expressing the properties to be monitored, and for the architecture of the monitoring framework, allows to combine the advantages of the two approaches and to obtain a general, comprehensive solutions for BPEL monitoring.},

Research shows remote sensing technology has long been recognized the significance in geological works, which greatly promoted mineral exploration in a cost-effective manner, especially in the Himalayan orogenic belt with poor natural environment. However, several challenges still exist in relation to the limited spectral band and spatial resolution of remote sensing images, as well as the onerous data processing. In this context, this study sought to resolve these two issues by applying a hybrid approach that comprises image fusion, metric learning, and random forest methods. For the first challenge, multisource and multisensor remote sensing data were integrated to provide more comprehensive spatial texture characteristics and spectral information. To address the second challenge, this study used a hybrid method of metric learning and random forest to promote computing efficiency and classification accuracy. This process is illustrated through a case study of lithological mapping in Cuonadong dome, the northern part of the Himalayan orogeny belt. Seven target lithological units were effectively discriminated with an 85.75% overall accuracy. This provides an important scientific basis for further exploration for rare metal deposits in the Himalayan orogeny belt, and a way of thinking for detecting geological features under harsh natural conditions.},

  abstract={IoT has emerged as an unprecedented paradigm with great potential for changing how people interact, think and live. It is making existing Internet services feasible in ways that were previously impossible, as well as paving the way for new situation- awareness applications suitable for smart cities, such as realtime video surveillance, traffic control, and emergency management. These applications will typically rely on large numbers of IoT devices to collect and collaboratively process streamed data to enable real-time decision making. In this article, we introduce the concept of Semantic Virtual Space (SVS), an abstraction for virtualized cloud-enabled IoT infrastructure that is commensurate with the goals and needs of these emerging smart city applications, and propose and discuss scalable architectures and mechanisms that enable and automate the deployment and management of multiple SVS instances on top of the cloud-enabled IoT infrastructure.},

  abstract={Homogeneous cluster architectures dominating high-performance computing (HPC) today are challenged, in particular when thinking about reaching Exascale by the end of the decade, by heterogeneous approaches utilizing accelerator elements. The DEEP (Dynamical Exascale Entry Platform) project aims for implementing a novel architecture for high-performance computing consisting of two components - a standard HPC Cluster and a cluster of many-core processors called Booster. In order to make the adaptation of application codes to this Cluster-Booster architecture as seamless as possible, DEEP provides a complete programming environment. It integrates the offloading functionality given by the MPI standard with an abstraction layer based on the task-based OmpSs programming paradigm. This paper presents the DEEP project with an emphasis on the DEEP programming environment.},

  abstract={Intelligence is a driving force or an ability to acquire and use knowledge and skills, or to inference in problem solving. This keynote lecture describes the taxonomy and nature of intelligence. It analyzes roles of information in the evolution of human intelligence, and the needs for logical abstraction in modeling the brain and natural intelligence. A formal model of intelligence is developed known as the generic intelligence mode (GIM), which provides a foundation to explain the mechanisms of advanced natural intelligence such as thinking, learning, and inferences. A measurement framework of intelligent capability of humans and systems is presented in the forms of intelligent quotient, intelligent equivalence, and intelligent metrics. On the basis of GIM model and theories, the compatibility of nature and machine intelligence is revealed, which forms a theoretical foundation for rigorous study in machine intelligence, AI, and intelligent systems.},

  abstract={In this article, a methodology to incorporate non-conforming interfaces between several conforming mesh regions is presented for Maxwell's curl-curl problem. The derivation starts from a general interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin formulation of the curl-curl problem and eliminates all interior jumps in the conforming parts but retains them across non-conforming interfaces. Therefore, it is possible to think of this Nitsche approach for interfaces as a specialization of discontinuous Galerkin on meshes, which are conforming nearly everywhere. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated in two numerical examples, including parameter jumps at the interface. A convergence study is performed for h-refinement, including the investigation of the penalization- (Nitsche-) parameter.},

  abstract={Cognitive control -the ability to produce appropriate behavior in complex situations -is a fundamental aspect of intelligence. It is increasingly evident that this control arises from the interaction of dynamics in several brain regions, and depends significantly on processes of modulation and dynamical biasing. While most research has focused on explanations of behavioral responses seen in experiments and pathologies, it is reasonable to expect that internal functions such as planning and thinking would also use similar control mechanisms. In this paper, we present a connectionist model for an idea generation process that can rapidly retrieve old ideas in familiar contexts and search for novel ideas in unfamiliar ones. Based on a simple reinforcement signal, the system learns context-dependent biases that represent effective internal "response systems" for generating ideas from conceptual elements. A broad goal of the research is to show that preconfigured structural modularity, limited real-time selectivity, and adaptive modulation can interact to produce the flexible functionality necessary for cognition and intelligent behavior.},

  abstract={We introduce a genetic algorithm-based method for structural optimization of multiplicative general parameter (MGP) finite impulse response (FIR) filters. These computationally efficient reduced-rank adaptive filters are robust, suitable for predictive configurations, and they have numerous applications in 50/60 Hz power systems instrumentation. The design process of such filters has three independent stages: Lagrange multipliers-based optimization of the sinusoid-predictive basis filter, genetic algorithm-based search of optimal FIR tap cross-connections and, finally, the online MGP-adaptation phase guided by variations in signal statistics. Thus, our multistage design procedure is a complementary fusion of hard computing (HC) and soft computing (SC) methodologies. Such advantageous fusion (or symbiosis) thinking is emerging among researchers and practicing engineers, and it can potentially lead to competitive combinations of individual HC and SC methods.},
