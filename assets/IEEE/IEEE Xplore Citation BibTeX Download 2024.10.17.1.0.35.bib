  abstract={As a repetition of cognitive activities occurring in designers' thinking process, mental iteration is considered to be a natural feature of a designer's competency. Although the utilization of mental iteration is believed to increase the efficiency of the design process and lead to better quality solutions, the current understanding of it is still limited. This paper presents coding categories that were developed from a study on graphic design behavior. An experiment is conducted to study the effect of AI-augmented on the behavior of mental iteration. The results indicate AI-augment increases the frequency of cognitive activities in design iterations.},

  abstract={To make computers obtain a deeper thinking, we propose a question semantic representation model based on concept knowledge tree, which integrates concepts and knowledge to express questions' semantics. Combined the question semantic representation model and related knowledge, we introduce a knowledge-driven semantic reasoning algorithm to recursively obtain new knowledge for deepening the comprehending of questions. We evaluate the performance of our system on a collected dataset, and the top-1 accuracy reaches to 62.1%. Experimental results demonstrate our proposed methods improve the depth of question comprehending.},

  pages={254-259},
  abstract={It is very difficult for students who do not have a business career or experience to understand business models or structures. In addition, business models from the student viewpoint remain largely within a model-based understanding, and students do not have practical opportunities to create an image of business uncertainty. Our goal is to provide an experimental learning environment beyond the level of the students' hypothetical thinking about uncertainty in business. We have developed a versatile participatory simulation environment as an active learning environment for the university classroom. We apply a multiagent-based approach to represent the uncertainty of the business environment. This paper introduces one of our active learning programs, the Croquette Factory Game, for understanding business interaction with uncertainty. We show that this program provides beneficial educational effects for students in understanding a business model with uncertainty.},

  abstract={What is it that differentiates man and puts him on the throne of the entire animal kingdom? Yes, it's the human brain, and not the human, which is the most valuable creation of God. But the brain, all its knowledge and power are destroyed after the death of man. Is it possible to model a brain and upload the contents of the real natural brain into it thereby propagating life even after death? Yes, indeed. Today, organ donation is giving a new lease of life to many ailing patients, however can brain be added to the list of organs that can be donated? Imagine the marvels that would be back into existence if we could replicate and restore the brains of geniuses like Sir Albert Einstein or Newton or even our great leaders of the past like Mahatma Gandhi. This paper presents a literature survey on the Blue Brain technology that promptly answers all these sparkling questions. Scientists today are in research to take artificial intelligence to a level beyond everything, to create a virtual brain that could think, react, make decisions and also keep everything in some form of memory to do everything that a normal human brain can. To achieve this, the main approach is to upload an actual brain in a virtual brain. So that even after death the person's conscience would be able to function exactly as a normal brain in the form of a machine. IBM along with scientists at BMI (Brain and Mind Institute) École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) Research University in Switzerland are simulating the brain's biological systems into a 3D model, which would recreate the electrochemical interactions that take place inside the brain. If this simulation results in a success, the modeling would extend to different parts of the brain and make it function with all the abilities of a natural brain, thereby eliminating the chances of any brain malfunctions such as psychiatric disorders like depression and autism, which are possible in the normal brain. IBM names this project as the 'Blue Brain' project.},

  abstract={For unable to establish geometrical relationship of coordinates, conventional methods of 3D shape recovery can not be adopted to a great number of precious historical images to recover the 3D shape of the objects and environments in the images. The new method of 3D shape recovery based on single frame historical image is proposed in this paper. The core idea of this research is that, according to the change of the shade of gray of each pixel, the tilt angle and slant angle of the surface vertical vector of each object's pixel in the image is analyzed, then the depth of each pixel is calculated in response to the tilt angle and slant angle. Simulating human being's vision system and the process of thinking of brain, this method makes the process of man's 3D comprehension of single image computerize to obtain 3D digitized data. These 3D digitized data can be used in the fields of the 3D recovery of historical relics and the identification of 3D portrait and stereo literal.},

  abstract={The four dimension virtual reality modeling method is a tool for large and complicated project which need 3d detailed activity control. It has been originally developed as a component of an application that uses four dimension virtual reality modeling models of buildings (with time as 4th dimension showing the building process progression) for the interactive visualization of construction processes. We describe the theoretical and practical visualization issues solved in the implementation of an interactive real-time four-dimensional. We think that the four dimension virtual reality system can enhance the communication ability between managers and workers. We hope novice users become familiar with 4Record and to achieve a high ease of use of the whole interface. This paper will show the status of 4D- VR technology in China.},

  abstract={The statement “Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century” was printed in the Harvard Business Review about 10 years ago. Since then, data mining and artificial intelligence (AI) have become widespread and have been utilized in research and real world applications. We sometimes get consultations such as, “Please teach me about AI,” “I want to use deep learning in my business,” or “I want data mining to do a good job of analysis. What should researchers do? In response to these consultations, I will discuss three issues: 1) problems in which the data are available but cannot be used immediately (preprocessing issues), 2) problems in which the results are difficult to explain in an easy-to-understand manner (explainable AI), and 3) problems in which the purpose of data analysis has not been identified. First, I consider the topic “when we receive a consultation, there is a lot of data, but it is not ready for use.” This is a case in which the “data ready” stage identified by the researcher is different from the “data ready” stage identified by a general person. The second topic considers the following problem “the results presented by researchers are difficult for a general person to understand.” The researcher's explanations of the algorithm and its results are very difficult. A general person is unable to judge the data analysis result from the viewpoint of “is it useful for business?” The last topic is the most difficult; A general person vaguely thinks that “AI can do something,” but “something” does not allow researchers to identify issues. I will discuss the relationship between research and practical use and what can be done from an academic standpoint.},

  abstract={Online advertising has emerged as one of the major business models on the Internet. Publishers rely on the online revenue generated from online advertising to offer their free services. At the same time, intrusive ads such as pop-ups and animated layer ads are being perceived as annoying thing by an increasing number of Web users, because they distract the Web users from reading or navigating through the main content of web pages. It is definitely not a problem to place ads within Web pages as long as they do not become annoying. Thinking from the perspective of most users, online advertising should have a limit. It is necessary to model the intrusiveness of online advertising in order to ensure that a proper balance is achieved between user experiences and branding effectiveness. In this paper, an approach based on neural network is proposed to model the intrusiveness of online advertising. Comprehensive features of ads and hosting Web pages are exploited and effectively combined. Promising experimental results are obtained on Web pages collected from 500 Web sites.},

The relationship between role and agent is relative independent, and role model is established before agent model. In this paper, we think role and agent is interdependent, agent is carrier of role, and role means what agent can do. When analysis and design agent model, should firstly have agent entity, then have role. We define role as a set of computation specification and function to realize relationship between two agents, establish a mapping between BDI model and role, and define an agent BDI model based on role (RA) using Pi calculus. Based on theory analysis, RA can keep balance among belief, desire and intention, and maintain model stable. In the end, we give an example of RA, example show RA can be conveniently established and used to construct agent goal solving organization.},

The problems of understaffing of health care personnel compared to the WHO recommendation on the one hand, and the problems of poor distribution of these health care personnel over the extent of the health care system on the other hand, lead us to think about a model of mobility and accessibility of health care in Benin. This work aims at setting up an intelligent algorithm of accessibility and mobility of health care and will allow any patient embarked at any point of the health system to be taken care of automatically by a doctor and a nurse. To achieve this, we have (i) studied the state of the art of healthcare accessibility and mobility, (ii) modeled the healthcare trajectory, (iii) developed an algorithm for the automatic assignment and management of a patient in a healthcare system and simulated it using operations research and graph tools. The work allowed to set up a dynamic algorithm of accessibility to health care and to answer the challenges of the health care systems.},

Cybernetics pertains to time‐related actions that are carried out in an unstable environment. In the 1990s–2000s, it became obvious that what the pioneers N. Wiener, J. von Neumann and A. Turing had imagined was beginning to turn into reality. Of the three, only N. Wiener perhaps knew about transistors. Today, we have all the technology to provide good systemics.

  abstract={We consider the problem of computing gate-circuit approximations of quantum algorithms, i.e., unitary operators, from the perspective of computable (effective) analysis. The scientific community thinks the Solovay-Kitaev theorem a mile-stone in quantum compiling - the task of computing gate-circuit approximations - because it proves the existence of efficient quantum compilers in an analytic sense. However, since we cannot represent unitary operators in a mere analytical way on digital computers, contemporary digital implementations of quantum compiling resort to heuristic numerics and remain below the computational performance engineers hope to realize using the result of Solovay and Kitaev. This paper discusses quantum compiling within a framework of computable analysis, establishing a concept of computable unitary operators for digital computing based on the theory of Turing machines. Particularly, we prove that digital quantum compiling is uncomputable due to the underlying algebraic structure. Finally, we discuss several implications of our findings for heuristic digital implementations of quantum compiling, hinting toward possible research directions to thoroughly understand the relevant bottlenecks.},

  abstract={Number of networks and their sizes in terms of connected devices are increasing very rapidly. These devices are producing massive amount of raw data for different progressive purposes that need to be processed and stored somewhere. Local data storage and complete processing of massive data will not be possible by resource constrained Internet of Things (IoT) enabling devices anymore in the future. Therefore, there is a need of data storage and processing capabilities to meet the desired goals of applications. Cloud computing and edge computing are the possible solution to circumvent limited data storage and computation issues of IoT devices. This paper presents a comparative study of popular architectures in which IoT devices are integrated with cloud. For this purpose, various IoT and Cloud of Things (CoT) architectures have been studied. Strengths and weaknesses of the studied IoT and CoT architectures are comprehensively analyzed on the basis of five comparison parameters namely; resource based segregation of IoT enabling devices, range based segregation of the communication network, segregation of security solutions, cloud connectivity, and edge computing services.},

  abstract={In In fact, this era has been marked at a crossroad of technology and creativity, amalgamating and bringing up the revolutionary peak in the contemporary landscape of literature due to the induction of artificial intelligence into the production and analysis of Indonesia literature. This paper tries to outline the evolving relationship of human expression with machine intelligence—in other words, it tries to answer how AI algorithms have redefined the landscape of Indonesia literature from creation to critique. This paper will discuss firstly the historical development of AI in literature from a seed idea to its present sophisticated application. It is against this background that the paper explains how this has been done through a comprehensive review of existing literature. It brings out the way AI has become a collaborator and a provocateur in the creative process by making it possible for humanity to create poetry, prose, and narrative structures. This paper will delve into a few of the most telling examples and casuistries into exactly how AI-generated literature differs—from the level of its stylistic tendencies to the quantity of its thematic preoccupations. The research will also analyze the impact of AI on literature analysis and interpretation. Even canonical works were given new keys to be read with the help of advanced algorithms in text and sentiment analysis, and their light was shed on contemporary texts too. Below, the following sections, is a survey of some of the ways AI-driven methodologies have only augmented traditional literary analysis, allowing scholars to draw patterns, themes, and even nuances of language that may escape ordinary human perception.},

  abstract={20 years after the appearance of Soft Computing, this paper serves reflecting cognitions on “soft concepts”, Soft Computing and “soft sciences”. We consider soft concepts and hard concepts that have to be distinguished from each other. “Hard” concepts have been strictly defined in logics more than 100 years ago, but “soft” concepts have not been used in science before the 21st century. We give a brief view on the history of Soft Computing, we distinguish “hard” and “soft” concepts in science, and we consider the opposite pair “Hard Computing” and “Soft Computing”. We separate hard sciences and soft sciences and we give some examples for the key role that soft concepts and Soft computing could play in future soft sciences.},

  title={Retracted: Limitations and Improvement Thinking of Code-Prescribed Static Analysis Method for Vessel Impact Design of Bridge Structures},

  abstract={Analysis methods are essential for the vessel-impact resistant design of bridge structures, which have respect to reasonably determine the demand and capacity of bridge structures subjected to vessel impact loading. For this reason, a number of researchers have paid their attention to develop the reasonable analysis method for vessel-bridge collisions in the past twenty or thirty years, facilitating the development of the design methodology of bridge structures under vessel collisions. For example, with the development of the nonlinear contact-impact finite element (FE) technique, the FE-based method has been developed and used in engineering practices. Also, some simplified methods have been proposed based on the nonlinear contact-impact FE technique. Although these methods are capable of clarifying the interaction mechanism between vessels and bridges, they cannot be used to replace the code-prescribed static analysis method due to computational efficiency. Hence, this paper places emphasis on the code-prescribed static analysis method. First, the limitation of the code-prescribed static analysis method is presented by comparing their results with the dynamic results. Then, based on the two degrees of freedom (DOF) system, the equivalent static analysis method considering the load pattern is investigated through the shock spectrum analysis method. This work provides an idea for improving the code-specified static analysis method.},
