  abstract={The impact of new technology on higher vocational education(HVE) has attracted the attention of many domestic scholars. The current direction of education informatization research is mostly smart classrooms. Therefore, schools will inevitably promote education informatization through the use of smart classrooms, and smart classrooms with classroom teaching(CT), teacher-student activities, and Internet + education will also become the core. This article uses experimental analysis and questionnaire survey methods to experiment on the design and application of the intelligent CT model of deep learning in HVE, compare and analyze the learning effects of the experimental and control classes of computer professional courses, and investigate and analyze their attitudes to the application of the intelligent classroom model. The experimental survey results show that the outstanding students in the experimental class has more students than that in the control class, and the learning effect is better than the traditional mode in the smart CT mode of deep learning, and most students in the experimental class prefer the use of the smart classroom mode. It can be concluded that it is necessary to study the design and application of the intelligent CT model of deep learning in HVE. In the intelligent classroom teaching system, data mining, K-means algorithm and MapReduce framework are comprehensively applied. By analyzing various behavioral data of students in school, the potential value behind these data is mined, so as to improve the construction of intelligent classroom and promote the improvement of higher vocational education.},

  abstract={Adaptable Model Versioning (AMOR) is a framework intended to be adapted for versioning of model artefacts. AMOR framework is known for some limitations in the operation and conflict detection process, as well as in the conflict resolution process. This paper presents an attempt to improve AMOR framework using Critical Pair Analysis (CPA), a computation conducted to determine potential conflicts between a pair of operations. CPA computation results are used to detect conflicts between operations and also to determine the conflict resolutions. The test results show higher accuracy for the operation detection process, but they also show a slower performance. For the conflict resolution process, the use of CPA provides a fast and accurate result.},

  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Game-based learning or educational games has a constantly positive impact on learners while offering a variety of knowledge presentations and providing multiple opportunities to be applied during learning process. The development of an effective educational game has been a challenge for game developers to understand the depth and relationships between game play (rules and regulations), game environment, learning theories, and subject-matter (subject content, learners, teachers) embedded in the educational game. Thus, the authors have proposed a multi-domain framework with extracted implicit vaguely supported relationships through a systematic literature review. These relationships are verified through qualitative interviews with eight (8) game-based learning experts to validate the relationships. This paper presents seven (7) implicit relationships based on game play domain and discusses their relevancy with game environment, learning theories, and subject-matter by applying interpretive hermeneutic approach of qualitative study. Consequently, this paper concludes seven (7) explicit relationships in perspective of game play for game developers to reflect on during the development process of educational games.},

  abstract={The purpose of this study is to explore an affordable, accessible, holistic micro-college model that integrates blended learning using MOOCs to increase access to higher education in the developing world. In spite of the phenomenal growth of MOOCs, people in the Majority World fail to take advantage of them due to several challenges that include the cultural relevance of courses, differences in teaching and learning pedagogy, language barriers, and most tangibly, lack of sufficient telecommunication infrastructure. To address these challenges and maximize the potential of MOOCs for expanding access to higher education, a 2-year pilot program was launched in 2015 in an impoverished area of Nairobi, Kenya to explore a new learning modality combining quality online materials and in-class meetings with learning facilitators. This paper discusses the potential of such a model to scale beyond the initial pilot to make higher education accessible to those with the least access.},

  abstract={Integration of all engineering related information in a single complex product model is one of the main purposes in computer system based engineering activities. Because engineering process highly depends on product development and application projects, its definition was first realized in product modeling environments at the application of product data management (PDM) systems. However, this administrative solution could not be integrated with the content of product descriptions. As a contribution to efforts for integration of engineering process definitions in product model, work in a recent research project theoretically grounded the definition of engineering process entities and their connections with product model entities. The author of this paper participated at that project and considered practical points of view in order to reveal possibilities for the implementation of the proposed method in industrial product modeling environments. This paper introduces an analysis on the role of product model in engineering process and characteristics of processes for engineering process definition. Following this, it discusses definition, integration, coordination, content, product, and background related resources of engineering process definition in product model.},

  abstract={Mathematical models can be very useful for understanding complicated systems, and for testing algorithms through simulations that would otherwise be difficult or expensive to implement. A model has been devised that simulates the sound localization performance of normal hearing persons, and that is being further refined for simulation of performance of hearing-impaired persons wearing two cochlear implants (CIs). The model is intended to be a tool in understanding the relative contribution of various factors involved in acoustic localization, and in developing new signal processing algorithms for neural encoding strategies. This presentation overviews the development of and results for the normal hearing model, and discusses modifications that are needed to simulate sound processing with binaural cochlear implants. The human head related transfer function (HRTF) is a critical component of the model, and provides the characteristics of head shadow, torso and pinna effects. It defines the temporal, intensity and spectral cues reaching each ear that are important for good localization ability. The model has been validated against published literature on HRTFs and localization in normal listeners, and is being further developed to account for differences in the signal pathway and sound reaching the CI user due to sound processing and microphone location effects.},

  abstract={Today digital media such as social networks, chat rooms, and forums have gained much importance in human life for information sharing. Users will share their knowledge and emotions in their own languages. This will create a novel syntax to communicate their messages with as much as pithiness as possible. Noisy text is characterized by unusual forms such as abbreviations, phonetic translations, short forms etc. This led to the emergence of text normalization. Cleaning the noisy text has become an important factor for adequate development and deployment of NLP (Natural Language Processing) services such as text-to-speech and automatic translation. In this paper we introduce a channel based normalization model for cleaning the noisy texts. The normalization is based on the types of distortion such as grapheme distortion, abbreviation and phoneme distortion. The model will explore the type of distortion occurred in the noisy word and replace it by using the different channel list. Precursory evaluation shows that the channel model will normalize the noisy word to their standard peer with 96.43 % accuracy.},

Hence meta-search engines are used to solve the problem of low web space information coverage rate of individual search engines. A meta-search engine is a kind of search tool that dynamically dispatches user query to the underlying search engines, hence providing parallel access to multiple search engines and then aggregate the results to present single consolidated result list to user. In this paper, a novel meta-search engine, MetaFusion, has been proposed. The proposed algorithm combines fuzzy AHP with genetic algorithm to get more comprehensive and optimized results. Experimental results shows that relevancy of results returned by MetaFusion is more than several existing research Metasearch engines. The precision of MetaFusion is more when compared with Dogpile and Infospace.},

  abstract={Integration and adding intelligence are essential objectives in development and application of information systems. An old wish of engineers is to have a highly integrated system for the handling of all necessary information during the entire lifecycle of an industrial product. Development of modeling and simulation based product lifecycle management (PLM) systems grounded the realization of such a system during the first decade of this century. The next step is to fill these systems with content in which practice, skill, experience, and intelligence of engineers are represented at a minimum level for successful understanding of a product model in absence of the humans who defined that content. The authors published some results in this topic area in recent years. In this paper, they describe some new methodological elements in order to achieve better representation capability of their earlier proposed modeling. They characterize intelligence in modeled content, explain indirect method for mapping of knowledge at object definition, and discuss expertise and knowledge sources for product model.},

  abstract={This paper presents an integrated learning best practice for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) using applied and interactive learning methods. The work is based on using MATLAB software as a tool to teach students basic coding, mathematical concepts, design, and logic. This research paper focuses on teaching polar coordinates and Fibonacci numbers as essential concepts where the students can then build on their knowledge. Research in integrated STEM can support STEM educators to determine best practices. This work supports the need for further research and discussion on the knowledge, experiences, and teaching methods for STEM education. It also advocates for integrated STEM education as one of the ways that make learning more connected, engaging, and sustainable for students.},
