  abstract={This paper presents the initial results of a research that aims to evaluate the contribution of the Scratch visual programming language in the development of computational thinking in comparison to the use of pseudocode. The comparison scenario was the teaching of programming logic for higher education students of the Physics course. The research was outlined with the methodology of action research, allowing the evaluation of the use of language at the end of the approach of each content delivered during the research. The presented results refer to the approach of two contents, of the four established for the conclusion of the research. The steps of approaching each content were initiated with the application of the diagnostic evaluation, and finalized with the evaluation of performance. The results indicate a progression in knowledge about programming logic. In this way, it was possible to verify that the use of the Scratch language contributed to the learning of programming logic.},

  abstract={STEAM-blended programming education is considered to be particularly effective for training computational thinking. In this paper, we aim to develop a web-based learning environment for STEAM-blended programming education. The proposed system can provide the learning materials of JavaScript that can easily carry out STEAM education at educational institutions. To effectively realize STEAM-blended programming education, visual programming is useful. Therefore, first, we will examine the learning effectiveness of visual programming. Next, we will develop a web-based programming learning support system based on "Mathematics" learning with JavaScript. After the above, the concept of STEAM-blended learning material using LEGO Mindstorms EV3 is shown.},

Therefore, people have difficulties to find the sub-optimal service among the overflow data in Internet. In education area, new trend with various ICT tools such as YouTube, STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts and Mathematics) supportive computational thinking software is famous. In this paper, we propose YouTube aware personalized recommender system for future ICT education. It is a technique to automatically rank high - visibility channels and videos in YouTube based on the personalized learning topic. To do this, we analyze the relevance of statistics such as views, likes, subscribers, and comments in YouTube, and use the R programming language with the rvest, ggplot2, stringr packages and the Chrome extension called SelectorGadget for direct data crawling. Initial experiments confirmed the possibility of the proposed technique and confirmed the possibility of extension.},

  abstract={Microsoft's Kodu is a visual programming environment for children inspired by robotics rule-based formalism to specify behaviors. The reactive nature of this approach means that systems just react to what they are currently sensing, they do not need to have a perfect model of the world, and they can easily respond to external changes in the world. This resilience makes behavior-based systems perfect for real world robotics use. When developers chose this approach for Kodu, the hope was that this resilience would help minimize the potential frustration of young users. This paper introduces the Kodu developers' strategy, results and future plans in developing a user-friendly programming environment that successfully introduces children in a fun and easy way to the fundamental concepts of computer science and computational thinking.},

  abstract={Accelerated by the Do-It-Yourself mindset of the Web 2.0 culture, end-user programming, which is programming by end users with limited, if any, formal programming background, is growing rapidly. Especially in educational settings, children are exposed to computational thinking by making games, building scientific simulations and creating stories. Early educational programming languages such as Logo have made programming substantially more accessible to end users. More recent approaches include visual programming with drag-and-drop style of programming making it nearly impossible to compose syntactically incorrect programs. However, as the syntactic challenges of end-user programming are gradually fading into the past, the new frontier of semantic programming support emerges. This demonstration introduces Future Trace, a system to make programming more conversational. A conversational programming agent runs programs one step into the future in order to visualize discrepancies between the programs users intended to write and the actual programs.},

  abstract={The teaching of programming in primary and secondary education has once again revealed the heterogeneity of the ways in which students learn and instructors teach such a capability. Language barriers and technological skills of the involved people are some of the factors that affect the usability and usefulness of educational programming environments. This article presents a gamified programming environment, called Damo's Quest, that supports middle school instructors while they teach programming to students who have little access to computer technology and proficiency in English language. The platform offers a gamified-educational experience, in which students must deal with challenges in fantasy stories (in virtual worlds) by programming various solutions. The usability and perceived usefulness of the first version of this tool have been evaluated by two researchers, who are experts in computational thinking. Although preliminary, the results are highly encouraging.},

  abstract={Learning programming language syntax is considered an obstacle in programming education. However, we believe it is an overlooked opportunity to exploit obvious synergies with Math. As evidenced around the world, middle and high school students know the syntax required to compute simple expressions, without previous exposure to programming languages. We make the case for an “expressions first” approach to facilitate the development of computational thinking. Our approach has the benefit of integrating directly with Math, which in turn reinforces the teaching of other STEM subjects as well as non-STEM ones. We report early results of an ongoing trial using a visual computing environment that supports this approach.},

  abstract={The jigsaw pedagogy as a student-centered instructional approach has been successfully applied in information technology classrooms, but there is a lack of empirical research on the effectiveness of jigsaw pedagogy in unplugged environments. Therefore, this study combined the jigsaw pedagogy with unplugged activities and verified the teaching effect of such a combination through randomized group experiments. The results of the study showed that the combination of the jigsaw pedagogy and the unplugged activities was more conducive to promoting students' motivation and the development of computational thinking than the unplugged activity alone. Drawing upon the research findings, this study concluded with several implications for teachers to reform information technology classrooms in unplugged environments.},

  abstract={When the classical theory of problem solving is put into practice, a sequence of operator applications must be found that transforms an initial problem state into a goal state. This is equivalent to finding a path through the graph of possible problem states from an initial node to a goal node. The search is usually conducted by an algorithm or by a human through an iterative process of selecting and applying operators to states found so far. Here, I demonstrate examples of searching in problem spaces via interactive drawing. The demonstrations help to elucidate issues in the design of new problem-solving affordances that may enhance the abilities of human solvers to understand and solve problems. This opens up new ways to conceptualize the process of solving problems, and it suggests new ways to teach a form of computational thinking.},

  abstract={This paper presents the development and use of empathy interviews at Iowa City Community School District (ICCSD) which is the fifth largest school district in the state. At this district, equity challenges have arisen as the city has grown rapidly over the past decade, shifting from a rural and predominantly White college town to a burgeoning tech sector with a significant influx of Latinx families. During the first two years of participation in the Developing Inclusive K-12 Computing Pathways Research Practice Partnership (CT Pathways), the district developed a computing pathways document to guide schools and teachers in the integration of computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT). After a year piloting their pathway, an Inclusive CT Pathways Committee was formed to review the existing pathways document and ensure it was ably addressing the district's overall equity goal of better serving students from Black and Latinx communities. As an orientation step to personalize this goal and understand it within the context of their own classrooms and schools, teachers on the Inclusive CT Committee conducted empathy interviews to learn more about the computing experiences of their students. Teachers reflected upon the structure of the interview protocol, the insights they gained, and the potential opportunities the approach afforded them to address misconceptions about computing. They described the interviews as opportunities to learn more about designing supports, on-ramps, and more inclusive computing opportunities for students.},

  abstract={Teachers living and working in rural areas in the United States often lack access to high-quality professional development (PD) opportunities. As computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education pathways increasingly develop in rural districts, it is essential to provide quality PD for their teachers so they can identify opportunities for and plan to embed CS and CT learning in their classrooms. A key element in delivering high-quality PD is understanding the specific educational and wider cultural needs of the community where it will be delivered, something we call “mining cultural capital”. In this poster, we report on the delivery of four 30-minute virtual PD sessions within two rural school districts in Eastern Kentucky: Pikeville Independent and Floyd County Schools. The virtual sessions were specifically geared toward elementary and middle school teachers. The sessions were led by a long-time educator in the region who worked to curate relevant examples and delivered the PD via a recorded video conference. The recordings are available for teachers in the region to watch and re-watch as they develop their lessons. Survey results showed that participating teachers found the PD to be valuable. Furthermore, feedback from teachers suggests that access to these short just-in-time PD sessions provided valuable learning opportunities and also sparked new lesson ideas for teachers.},

Two of the authors have been involved in the re-design, implementation and execution of a basic programming and CT course, offered to first-semester students as part of the Information science, IT and interaction design bachelor program, at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU). The central problem we faced in restructuring our introductory course, was finding a game genre that could support creative coding for beginners, be motivational and recognizable by the students, and would work with our use-modify-create learning approach. Our findings suggest that point-and-click games are an effective way to provide scaffolding and ease non-technical students into P5 programming. The genre has good expressive power, and the students were motivated because they recognized and could relate to the games they worked on. Future work will address students’ problems with scaling up the point-and-click games.},

  abstract={A key strategy for bringing computer science (CS) education to all students is the integration of computational thinking (CT) into core curriculum in elementary school. But teachers want to know how they can do this on top of their existing priorities. In this paper, we describe how our research-practice partnership is working to motivate, prepare, and support an elementary school to integrate equitable and inclusive computer science into core curriculum. Data were collected from teachers at a K-5 school where 65 % of students are Hispanic or Latinx, 46% are English Learners, and 65 % are eligible for free or reduced lunch. Data included semi-structured interviews, educators' written reflections, and observations of classroom implementation and professional development. The findings show how the school is building buy-in and capacity among teachers by using a coaching cycle led by a Teacher on Special Assignment. The cycle of preparation, implementation, and reflection demystifies CS by helping teachers design, test, and revise coherent lesson sequences that integrate CT into their lessons. Contrasting case studies are used to illustrate what teachers learned from the cycle, including the teachers' reasons for the integration, adaptations they made to promote equity, what the teachers noticed about their students engaging in CT, and their next steps. We discuss the strengths and the limitations of this approach to bringing CS for All.},

  abstract={The focus of this paper is on the time dependent availability modeling and analysis of repairable multi component systems. Analytical techniques become very complicated and unrealistic especially for modern complex systems. There have been attempts in the literature to evolve more realistic techniques using simulation approach for availability analysis of systems. This paper proposes a hybrid approach called as Markov System Dynamics (MSD) approach which combines the Markov approach with system dynamics simulation approach for the time dependent availability analysis and to study the dynamic behavior of systems. To the best of the authors' knowledge, in the published literature the authors generally assume that repairable systems reach their steady state when operational time reaches infinity. However, in practical situations it is important to know at what time the steady state begins. Therefore, another objective of this paper is to evaluate the time at which repairable multi component systems reach their steady state of operations. The proposed framework is illustrated for multi component systems such as a three component system with one component on standby with a numerical example. The results of the simulation when compared with that obtained by traditional Markov analysis clearly validate the Markov System Dynamics (MSD) approach as an alternative approach for the time dependent availability analysis.},
