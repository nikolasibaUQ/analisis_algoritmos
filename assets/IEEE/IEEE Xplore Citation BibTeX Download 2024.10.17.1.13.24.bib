  abstract={Up to this point we have been concerned with forming a preliminary definition of general intelligence and then taking stock of the ways that it has been approached in human cognition and computational intelligence. This chapter begins a discussion of the kinds of resources that might be available to overcome the current limitations. A main focus of this chapter is on the idea that cognition does not flow in only one direction. What we perceive and what we think is affected by context and by expectations. The chapter continues with a discussion of how language is both a problem for intelligence and a contributor to intelligence, and it concludes with a discussion of common sense.},

  abstract={Scientific and technological progress has promoted social change, and digital technologies such as big data, the Internet, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things have begun to develop, changing human thinking structure, living habits, learning behaviors, communication methods, and production technologies. Big data, as a hot topic in current digital technology and digital development, is based on massive data and generates value through computational analysis. It has been applied in various fields and different scenarios. China has issued the “Overall Layout Plan for Digital China Construction” document, which clarifies the need to accelerate the construction of Digital China, promote digital technology innovation, improve the digital governance system, and enhance digital security capabilities. The digital reform and development of education is an important part of the construction of a digital China, and it is an inevitable path to achieve the modernization of China's education. The development of digital education requires innovative digital applications in teaching methods, teaching resources, teaching evaluation, educational governance, and actively promoting the application of digital technologies such as big data and cloud computing in specific educational scenarios. The performance management of university teachers, as one of the important contents of educational governance and university management, relies on big data to establish a data governance system for the performance management of university teachers, which is precisely the demand for the digital development and construction of education. This article explores the application of big data in the digital construction of performance management for university teachers from three aspects: background, definition and characteristics of big data, and digitalization of performance management for university teachers. With big data as the core and data governance as the goal, big data application design is carried out from three perspectives: improving the digital performance system for university teachers, digitizing the performance content of university teachers, and designing a big data platform for university teacher performance management.},

  abstract={Jeff Raskin coined the term Information Appliance at Apple Computer in 1978. Martin Libicki advanced the concept of the Battlespace from his 1996 Telemetry of War essay in which our modern notion of netcentric warfare was advanced. Using these concepts we incorporate the modern information technology phenomena of everyware and persistent computing toward evolution in new forms of human enhancement. Given that most if not all humans will eventually equate to information devices in persistent computing architectures - we refer to them in this research as Human Information Appliance (HIA). This project is first and foremost a futures oriented product for the purpose of thinking about - in advance - risk and resilience analysis and management for a time that is beginning to feel familiar - if yet to come. We apply the HIA concept in a futures scenario where the arrival of exponential computational speed may produce effects to create novel solutions for human-machine environments/spaces. This form of human enhancement may also pose significant risk that requires a public ethical analysis toward prescriptive policy work in the present.},

It is well known that the operation of interpretative transcription of texts written in Cyrillic is extremely laborious, but it will solve a problem of great interest to humanities researchers who are concerned with the study of the Romanian language in its diachronic evolution. We think that the present study will impact the humanities research, including that of paleography, history, archaeology and that field of linguistics interested in the study of the language in diachrony, but it will also help the researchers in the field of computational linguistics that develop models for old language, in order to develop a diachronic POS tagger, so necessary to recover old lemmata.},

  abstract={In the current world, more confidential information on untrusted repositories is maintained such that it is important to encrypt data on these pages. New encryption methods are being developed and improved from time to time. "AES" (Advanced Encryption Standard) is one such encryption protecting machine, which offers fine grained access control. Think of the ABE as a Cipher Scheme. However, the expressive mode of the ABE method can be problematic for the ABE in interpreting the key clarification and result in a low computational performance for the key problem and key decryption. To fix this issue, several outsourced versions of the Chinese Abacus (a concrete plane not made of beads on sticks), were built to improve the reliability of its use. This paper describes the various methods suggested and contrasts them, illustrating the benefits with the drawbacks.},

  abstract={As computational thinking (CT) emerges as a required skill in the modern educational and professional landscape, the use of games for learning programming has gained prominence. However, consideration for the user's needs and experiences is as important as the educational content itself, in order to ensure that the learner has an engaging experience. For this reason, this paper explores the integration of Empathic Design principles into the user experience (UX) evaluation of several popular programming genre games aimed at cultivating CT. The findings indicate a partial positive alignment with these principles, particularly in user-centric design, learning journey, and visual aspects. Learner-players feedback emphasized engaging experiences and visual appeal, while improvement suggestions centered on enhancing interface depth, providing clearer instructions, and addressing challenges for beginners and scalability issues.},

  abstract={Problem based learning has been adapted by various universities and inscribed with perspectives based on the demographic challenges. The method known to be effective for producing lifelong learners and improve cognitive skills, has been experimented on several facades. Problems, being major drivers in the process, have been researched to design and the deliberate the most effective ways. Through this paper we propose a game based learning model which can be used as problems in a problem based learning framework. In contrast to learning activities supplied using more old-fashioned didactic methodologies, this strategy can be used to engage a student through meaningful activities. This paper presents a model to use game in problem based learning followed by a case study and its analysis. Giglane game was used in the process to analyze the effectiveness with respect to number of stakeholders and incidents reported. The method is validated for effectiveness and promises to be an effective strategy for reflections and self-directed learning attributes. The method directly supports the decomposition structure from the computational thinking methodology which can be combined with the problem based learning process.},

We set aside, for the moment, thinking about psychology, social science, art and creativity studies and consider what it is that we can do with computers and how this is being used to achieve the goals of computational creativity. The study of algorithms belongs to what Herbert Simon described as The Sciences of the Artificial,<superscript>2</superscript> where we do not study the world as it is, out there, but study our own built environment and the process of building that environment, which we can do in an interactive, probing manner through the production of new designs and inventions.

  abstract={The goal of this research full paper is to provide insight into most recent findings of interviews with faculty members teaching digital skills in an integrated and innovative way embedded into courses on subject didactics of a teacher education program. Pre-studies analyzing students' perspectives regarding the inclusion of digital competences in the teacher education program of a large Central-European university revealed that less than half of the students who were at an advanced stage in their studies felt sufficiently prepared to impart digital competences in their daily teaching. Given the importance of being digitally competent in the modern, digital era, the question arises, how digital competences can be sustainably included in the curriculum of a teacher education program. This paper analyzes interviews with five faculty members successfully teaching digital skills in concert with subject didactics of Geography in order to identify best practices for the integration of digital competences. The first author asked our Interview Partners to provide insight into the content they mediated, the integration of digital competences and tools in their courses, how their teaching could be further improved, and what challenges they encounter. Eventually, we looked for best practices and collected instructors' thoughts on improvements on a curricular level and examples of transferring the good practices to other subjects, such that future students could benefit from a better integration of digital competences. For this paper, we analyzed the data with a mixture of narrative analysis and thematic analysis. Improving the mediating of digital skills and competences in a wider range of subjects at the university level should eventually help students, and ultimately their students, to implement digital know-how such as modern teaching tools into their courses, making teaching more effective and computational thinking as well as related fields of computing more accessible to academic as well as secondary and younger students. The research so far has shown promising results considering examples of tools that can be used on a broad spectrum of subjects and lead to a factor of learned new digital competences if used properly. On the other hand, lecturers also warned about relying too much on technology in specific tasks such as orientation on a map or analyzing statistical data. We conclude that combining existing approaches with new, more modern didactics can be the key to transferring the competencies required for our students' future.},

  abstract={The push to develop low-stakes and personally meaningful computer science experiences is creating novel opportunities to broaden participation in CS. These opportunities have become increasingly present across contexts and have expanded the possibilities for introducing and sustaining student participation in computing. However, while these experiences tend to be effective ways for engaging new participants and new forms of participation, we must be careful to not overlook how ’high-stakes’ these experiences might be for learners. To explore this tension, this paper describes two case studies of students engaging in coding and computational thinking with Minecraft Education Edition. The first case study involves a 7-year-old Black and Latina girl who experiences significant frustration when her computer program destroys significant portions of her project. The second is from a Latino boy who avoids using the coding capabilities in Minecraft EDU out of fear that the code might not work properly. Building on these case studies, this paper suggests that the field take steps to ensure that the language and actions associated with low-stakes and high-stakes are reflective of learner perceptions, and that we design learning experiences that appropriately reflect this nuance.},

  abstract={This Research-to-Practice Full Paper aims to introduce a methodological framework to foster Computational Thinking (CT) skills by teaching programming with Educational Robotics (ER) in High School. Problem-solving is an essential skill for human development, so it is necessary to introduce actions to improve this skill in High School. It is possible to stimulate problem- solving through computer programming teaching with ER. However, as far as we know, there are no methodologies for teaching programming with ER focusing on CT development in High School that went through scientific validation of the proposal. This study is an Educational Design Research that aims to introduce a methodological framework for teaching programming in High School with ER (named CTProgER) and validate two instances of the framework. It was considered consolidated teaching methodologies with ER, combined with the Anthropological Theory of Didactics and evidence from our ER studies. As a result, we present the CTProgER Framework guideline, two instances of the CTProgER Framework, and these instances’ validation through the Delphi method.},

  abstract={Today, teaching faces several challenges, including students’ difficulty in understanding abstract concepts and lack of motivation. To address these problems, the use of virtual reality (VR) has been explored as an innovative and potentially effective educational tool. However, so far, the effectiveness of VR applications and the perception of their use lack a clear and effective approach to be used to support education. The importance of addressing this problem lies in the need to improve the quality of teaching using emerging technologies. It is for this reason that it is important to find new strategies to improve the effectiveness of teaching using VR. In this context, this research presents the results of the FreeDev application, previously validated with 20 teachers and with 80 engineering students from a private university. FreeDev is a VR application designed to support the teaching of basic programming, it is aimed as an educational tool to provide an immersive experience to students on how to get started in programming and computational thinking. FreeDev has been well accepted, and both teachers and engineering students see it as a tool that can be used to support education. It is hoped that this research will contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the field of education.},

  abstract={This paper presents a novel automated approach to medical data classification using an interval type-2 fuzzy thinking system (IT2FLS) and wavelet transformation (WT). Wavelet coefficients are highly discriminative features that serve as condensed reconstructions of the underlying data. Uncertainty and high-dimensional data provide issues that are addressed by the combination of WT and IT2FLS. With the use of fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering for unsupervised structure learning and evolutionary algorithms for supervised parameter adjustment, the IT2FLS employs a hybrid learning approach. The use of WT streamlines this computationally demanding learning process, lowering computational load and improving IT2FLS performance. Well-known medical datasets (Cleveland heart disease and Wisconsin breast cancer) from the UCI Collection for machine learning are used for experimental assessments. Computed performance measures include area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The findings demonstrate the better efficacy of the wavelet-IT2FLS methodology in comparison to other machine learning techniques, such as adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, fuzzy ARTMAP, support vector machine, and probabilistic neural network. The suggested approach has potential to assist clinicians and medical professionals in making decisions.},

  abstract={Increasingly professional development (PD) programs have been designed and implemented for pre-service and in-service teachers to acquire CS content knowledge and CS pedagogy and instructional strategies for K-12 students. This paper reports on our adaptation, implementation and research program for K-8 CS teachers across a Midwestern state. More specifically, its PD program for K-8 CS teachers consists of a summer institute with two graduate courses and a series of Saturday workshops during the subsequent academic year. This paper focuses on the two summer courses: one on CS knowledge content including computational thinking, variables, conditionals, loops, arrays, functions, and algorithms, and one instructional strategies, student pedagogy, computer-aided education resources, and community building. We report our SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis of the two summer institutes involving the two courses to identify what went well and what needed improvement. This paper also reviews best practices for summer PD.},

  abstract={Both Artificial Intelligence (otherwise called recreated intelligence) and Robotics are instances of cutting edge improvements that will affect the development of mankind as fast as doable. The idea of “artificial intelligence” may be characterized as “any sort of artificial computational framework that exhibits shrewd lead, i.e., confounded direct that is successful for appearing at focuses on.” This definition envelops the conceivable outcomes of “artificial intelligence.” Minsky said that we ought to abstain from restricting “intelligence” to exercises that explicitly require data, whether or not they are performed by people. This proposes that we ought to join various machines, including those that illustrate “specific PC based intelligence that show just bound limits in learning or thinking anyway outperform presumptions at the robotization of explicit errands, likewise as machines general artificial intelligence that expect to make a by and large canny overseer.” Robots are the fake experts filling the role of real people. The fields of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer programming are the ones that meet up to frame robotics, which is a “part of recreated intelligence” that arrangements with the association, improvement, and use of robots. A theory on artificial intelligence can be viewed as here. The improvement of PC systems has made it conceivable to achieve undertakings that previously required the intelligence of a human. A few instances of these errands incorporate visual segregation, the affirmation of discussion, the arrangement of bearing, and the investigation of tongue contrasts. The subject matter expert, who is the “performer” in this reference, brings forth the item and polishes itself off in the body of the hardware. This is the key piece of the reference. The association between these two is that the control of the robot is an item expert that looks at input from the sensors, comes to a choice on what to do right away, and afterward guides the effectors to act in reality. The reason for this study is to give essential, basic measurements on two arising progressions: artificial intelligence (recreated intelligence), and robotics, as well as how much they are available in India. Consequently, the range of the things being examined is the primary significant part of these two disciplines. Moreover, it is feasible to portray them as being testing, engaging, and between disciplinary in nature. A flexible robot that was intended to complete various undertakings simultaneously to decide the ideal gathering that has the most noteworthy effectiveness extent of CAS model.},

  abstract={There has been an increasing interest in objects within the HCI field particularly with a view to designing tangible interfaces. However, little is known about two key issues in tangible interface design: how people make sense of objects and; how objects support thinking. This paper draws upon a study of how engineers learn from mechanical products as a starting point for considering how to design interactions with physical objects that have embedded computational capabilities, that is, hardware in the tangible digital domain. The key lessons are to design devices that support interaction and user inquiry. Mechanical devices are intelligible when they: give feedback; can be reconfigured; and perform differently in different contexts. These qualities allow their users to develop inquiry processes and to gradually build a repertoire of familiar devices and operating principles.},

  abstract={Suppose that you are the boss of a company and you want to accomplish a specific task through two groups of employees. Where, one group involves old and expert employees and the other consists of young and inexperienced ones. In this case, we think that your best choice is to establish a teamwork from both groups to ensure this mission will be done rapidly with high quality, of course, if the team members could work in consistence with each other. In this research, we are interested in investigating the benefit of applying this concept in search with two groups, one consists of a set of informed algorithms with different complexity based on their search mechanism, and the other group includes a collection of heuristic functions has varying degree of simplicity based on their informedness. The main goal of our study is the distinguishing of work teams that should be used to improve the efficiency of exploring the search space of a sliding-tile puzzle. The actual computational time of our experiments proved that choosing a proper teamwork can rapidly find optimal solutions by professionally exploiting the heuristic informedness and reducing the algorithm complexity.},
