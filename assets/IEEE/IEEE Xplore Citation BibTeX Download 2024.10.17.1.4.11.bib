  abstract={This paper presents a case on applying WebQuest, a model for constructivist inquiry-based learning, to facilitate the teaching and learning of queueing theory. The author is a faculty member in an information engineering department, teaching an undergraduate course titled Simulation and Statistical Analysis in which queueing theory is a key topic. In this paper, the author shares her experience of adopting WebQuest as a pedagogical tool. Overviews of constructivist pedagogies related to WebQuest, namely inquiry-based learning, collaborative learning, and scaffolding, are also provided. Instead of teaching the classic topic in an instructorcentered, direct instruction approach, the author constructed a WebQuest to help the students to design and conduct simulation projects to answer several nontrivial questions related to queueing theory. Scaffolding aids such as detailed descriptions of procedures and useful links to web resources, as well as an evaluation rubric, were also included in the WebQuest. This paper also includes results of a quantitative analysis on the effectiveness of adopting WebQuest to motivate students’ learning. Students’ interview comments and the author’s own reflection are also given.},

  abstract={Understanding a problem domain is a fundamental prerequisite for good software design. In object-oriented systems design, modeling is the fundamental first phase that focuses on identifying core concepts and their relations. How to properly support modeling is still an open problem, and existing approaches and tools can be very different in nature. On the one hand, lightweight ones, such as pen & paper/whiteboard or CRC cards, are informal and support well the creative aspects of modeling, but produce artifacts that are difficult to store, process and reuse as documentation. On the other hand, more constrained and semi-formal ones, like UML, produce storable and processable structured artifacts with defined semantics, but this comes at the expense of creativity. We believe there exists a middle ground to investigate that maximizes the good of both worlds, that is, by supporting software modeling closer to its essence, with minimal constraints on the developer's creativity and still producing reusable structured artifacts. We also claim that modeling can be best treated by using the emerging technology of touch-based tablets. We present a novel gesture-based modeling approach based on a minimal set of constructs, and CEL, an iPad application, for rapidly creating, manipulating, and storing language agnostic object-oriented software models, which can be exported as skeleton source code in any language of choice. We assess our approach through a controlled qualitative study.},

  abstract={Coercion combines flexible points, semi-automated optimization and expert guided manual code modification for adapting simulations to meet new requirements. Coercion can improve simulation adaptation efficiency by offloading large portions of work to automated search. This paper identifies requirements and related challenges in coercion, presents methods for gaining insight, and describes how to use these insights to make agile strategy decisions during a coercion. We call our optimization method agile optimization, because it allows users to preempt optimization and flexibly interleave alternative optimization methods and manual code modification, as needed. Agile optimization exploits the combined strengths of human insight and process automation to improve efficiency. We describe a prototype system and a case study that together demonstrate the benefits that can accrue from agile optimization.},

  abstract={Visual storytelling and story comprehension are uniquely human skills that play a central role in how we learn about and experience the world. Despite remarkable progress in recent years in synthesis of visual and textual content in isolation and learning effective joint visual-linguistic representations, existing systems still operate only at a superficial, factual level. With the goal of developing systems that are able to comprehend rich human-generated narratives, and co-create new stories, we introduce AESOP: a new dataset that captures the creative process associated with visual storytelling. Visual panels are composed of clip-art objects with specific attributes enabling a broad range of creative expression. Using AESOP, we propose foundational storytelling tasks that are generative variants of story cloze tests, to better measure the creative and causal reasoning ability required for visual storytelling. We further develop a generalized story completion framework that models stories as the co-evolution of visual and textual concepts. We benchmark the proposed approach with human baselines and evaluate using comprehensive qualitative and quantitative metrics. Our results highlight key insights related to the dataset, modelling and evaluation of visual storytelling for future research in this promising field of study.},

  abstract={This report covers two analyses that were conducted on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) synthetic environments (SEs), in this case games. (1.) Analysis 1 used a factor analysis on a set of 19 self-reported cognitive skills exercised while respondents played various PC-based games. The results verified the hypothesis that a few general cognitive phases could be drawn from the 19 variables. The four meaningful and predictable factors were detection (D), understanding (U), decision-making (DM), and execution (E). These factors represent general cognitive stages found in human factors literature such as situational awareness theory. (2.) The second analysis correlated the four derived factors with the participants' self-report of specific game enjoyment features. The outcome of this project provided a set of blueprints or templates for proper selection of COTS SEs and their components when attempting to apply them for enhancing human performance or training utility.},

  abstract={The advanced developments in the use of the modern technology, such as three-dimensional (3D) printing, internet of things and wearable devices have experienced a significant acceleration in terms of theoretical and practical aspects. These advanced techniques have played an important and vital role in many different fields of our life including the field of architecture. However, the presentation curriculum in the field of architectural education is still lacking in the actual application and optimal use of the (3D) printing technology at the local level in architectural departments for Iraqi universities. The paper aims to identify the innovative technologies and utilize them in the field of architectural education through developing an integrated framework for the Architectural Presentation curriculum using (3D) printer techniques. The latest methods and innovative technologies that have been accepted and applied in the field of E-learning and its utilization in the field of architectural education were reviewed and evaluated. In this paper, therefore, we focused in the proposed framework on the use of the three-dimensional (3D) printing technology in Architectural Presentation and analysing the obstacles that may face the implementation of this technology locally. The results illustrate that there is an urgent need to adopt such an innovative technology (3D printer) in our architectural presentation curriculum, because of its effectiveness as a powerful tool in the academic education. It is anticipated that the three-dimensional printing technology will help not only to develop the architect capabilities in generating the (3D) objects and models, but also to enable architects to implement their project with an accurate, ease and quick manner.},

  abstract={Self-improving and self-integrating systems (SISSY) often employ runtime models to represent their state and environment, and reason upon them to determine the required adaptation logic for reaching their goals. However, most model-based approaches rely on static modeling languages and cannot handle runtime uncertainty (e.g. dynamically integrated resources) that requires online language extensions. In previous work, we proposed an approach to extend the system's modeling language with new monitoring and action dimensions. However, the solution generates a high number of new language elements, slowing down the reasoning process for large systems. In this position paper, we propose a multi-level approach for extending the modeling language at runtime, and aim to provide online learning and reasoning at multiple levels of abstraction. Increasing the modeling abstraction decreases the number of concepts to reason about, hence improving scalability. We provide a preliminary validation of this proposal by detecting novel abstract dimensions from monitoring data from the smart home domain.},

  abstract={Improving undergraduates' information literacy level is the focus of contemporary higher education authorities. The information literacy level of undergraduates forms the core of the 21st-century talents and skills, and it is also an important factor influencing other skills. The cultivation of individual information literacy is influenced by both individual subjective factors and external objective factors. Based on the social constructivism theory, this study explores the influence of internal subjective factors (information processing dimension of learning style) and external objective factors (social media behaviour) on undergraduates' information literacy level through quantitative questionnaire data analysis. This study constructs a model of the internal and external influencing factors of undergraduates' information literacy level and proposes four hypotheses. The results verify the four hypotheses and prove the rationality of the model construction. In addition, suggestions are provided for individual undergraduates, high school management, and the concerned authorities of the social cultural environment.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Affective computing, particularly the identification of emotions from multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) signals, has gained importance. In this study, we propose a novel deep neural network model called Cycle Consistent Multi-Task Variational Autoencoder (CycleMVAE) to simultaneously investigate pairwise translation of emotional features, signal reconstruction, and emotion classification across two different EEG recording samples. CycleMVAE comprises two Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and a supervised classifier. Each VAE consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder of the first VAE transfers emotional properties from EEG sample X to a compact latent space Z, while the decoder retrieves these features from Z to transfer them to EEG sample Y. Similarly, the second VAE uses the compact latent space Z’ to transfer emotion features from EEG sample Y to EEG sample X. This forms a cyclic translation of feature among EEG sample recordings. The model is trained using reconstructed loss, cycle consistency loss, and latent vector regularization loss, with a supervised classifier used to categorize emotions into arousal, valence, and dominance categories. The proposed approach improves EEG classification performance while reducing pre-processing complexity. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been validated by experimental findings on the multimodal DREAMER emotional database.},

  abstract={We developed an intelligent argumentation system for collaborative decision support which allows stakeholders to exchange arguments, captures their rationale, and assesses aggregate thoughts on solution alternatives [1, 21]. In this article we propose and evaluate a method for computing aggregate thoughts of arguments on individual arguments, which represents individual thoughts, in an argumentation tree and further classifying arguments based on relationships between its aggregate thoughts and individual thoughts. A novel approach is developed to derive collective determination of an argument based on total support and attack that an argument receives in the argumentation tree. The collective determination value and the strength of an argument are used to analyze the relationship between aggregate thought and individual thought of arguments and cluster the arguments. The decision maker will be able to review clusters of arguments with opposing collective thoughts and supporting collective thoughts versus their individual thoughts. We have carried out an experiment to evaluate the proposed method, and the experimental results show that the proposed method is effective.},

The results demonstrate the efficacy of fine-tuning a pre-trained image generation model on a limited dataset, as measured by the ROUGE score. Sarid's contributions include addressing the lack of Arabic story generation models, providing a comprehensive dataset of Arabic stories, and integrating text and image generation for a cohesive story generation pipeline.},

  abstract={We present ComposIt, a creativity support tool that assists designers in finding inspiration by providing many computer-generated examples. These examples may be beyond humans' imagination and thus are helpful to inspire users to create new ideas. To automatically produce examples, our system adopts the deconstruction and construction strategies that are commonly used in the creative industries. Given a 3D model, the model deconstruction module analyzes the model and divides it into several elements. Then the model construction module synthesizes examples by composing the elements from different models. To evaluate the effectiveness of our system, we conducted a user study, in which artists were invited to design using our system. The results conclude that our system is able to inspire artists in their design process. The artists also shared their usage experience of our system in various aspects.},

  abstract={Previous researches have pointed out that simulation games can be an effective tool for enhancing the students' motivation to learn and understand complex subjects. Although the decision to use a simulation game is made mainly by the instructor, the students' perceptions are also important in order to support its usage. The increasing interest in educational simulation games motivates us to investigate relevant factors that influence the adoption of simulation games in Software Engineering courses. Based on a theoretical adoption model and on the evaluation of a specific simulation game, we identified crucial aspects beyond the ones usually considered, such as incorporating more industrial settings phenomena and pedagogical elements. These aspects are not always considered in Software Engineering simulation games, as we identified after an evaluation. Therefore, we concluded that this class of simulation games does not address suitably the adoption attributes that we found relevant.},

  abstract={As the business landscape progresses, the advancement of information systems is becoming increasingly valuable in shaping the future workforce. The rising demand for skilled employees who can navigate and manage technological tools and stay engaged in the workplace requires businesses to make significant efforts to advance their workforce's digital competencies and cognitive satisfaction. To understand this phenomenon better, considering the future workforce, specifically final-year students, could provide more valuable insights, as previous studies have been unable to capture this illustration fully. This research intends to understand willingness to engage behaviour of the future workforce through digital dexterity (i.e., personal-innovativeness, and computers self-efficacy) and psychological empowerment. A hypothesis-based framework delineated with seven paths, and data were collected through a questionnaire survey. To analyze the collected data from 147 respondents, a multivariate data analysis technique "PLS-SEM" was practiced. The study finding illustrated that personal innovativeness played a major role in impacting willingness to engage behavior followed by computer self-efficacy. These findings are novel and significant, providing new insights into the complex relationship between model variables among final-year students. The implications of this study would be particularly valuable for businesses looking to understand better and engage with the future workforce.},

Integrating hedonic elements into the human computer interface of GSS is one way to potentially enhance users' satisfaction with the meeting process, which in turn can influence usage intentions. Hence, this study explores the effects of perceived visual aesthetics on satisfaction with the meeting process using a free simulation study with twenty ad-hoc teams performing an idea generation and evaluation task. The results show a significant role of perceived visual aesthetics in predicting satisfaction with the meeting process.},

We consider facilitated CM as a process of undertaking CM primarily in facilitated workshops attended by a group of stakeholders. Facilitated workshops are a common practice in some fields of operational research (OR), System Dynamics (SD) and Problem Structuring Methods (PSM). The associated benefits of involving the stakeholders in the modelling process are reported in the literature such as enabling the mutual exploration of the problem situation and creating a strong ownership of the formulated problem. Further benefits related to CM are knowledge acquisition from domain experts, conflict resolution, fostering credibility and creativity. Reflecting on our experience, we consider the practical issues related to undertaking facilitated CM such as the group size and composition, team roles and the facilitator and the organization of workshops. The ideas put forward could be useful to modellers interested in undertaking facilitated CM.},

  abstract={Research skills are directly related to studying a problem thoroughly, investigating possible solutions, critically analyzing how to solve them, discussing, testing possibilities collaboratively, and adapting or creating new solutions. An undergraduate computing student with these competencies needs to understand and use different research methods, have a business vision, investigate technological alternatives, understand innovation models and their viability and, above all, know how to solve a problem systematically and collaboratively. Considering that these competencies are essentials in computing professionals, the following research question was defined: "How to stimulate research skills of undergraduate computing students?". Regarding answering that question, this Research Full Paper describes the design and implementation of an exchange program in the Research Laboratories of a public university in 2018 and 2019, aiming to foster research skills in undergraduate computing students. These experiences showed real benefits regarding students' performance in research, development, and innovation activities, besides improvement points for better management and execution. As the main contribution, it is possible to highlight the proposal for an exchange model between research laboratories, in which undergraduate students in Computing participate in research activities conducted in the PBL modality, learning through complex problems resolution under continuous monitoring and feedback.},

  abstract={Avebury Henge is situated approximately 20 miles north of Stonehenge in Wiltshire, U.K. and contains the largest known Neolithic stone circle in Europe. It is part of the Avebury, Stonehenge and Associated Sites World Heritage Site but is less well-known than Stonehenge, despite being an impressive monument with a ditch and bank system more than 400m in diameter. In the past 20 years or so many computer-based simulations of archaeological sites around the world have been created, but many of these digital reconstructions lack both the ability to enable personal presence of the user in the virtual landscape itself, and the facility for users to interact with others and the virtual environment around them in real time. The project described in this paper aims to research the issues of presence and interaction in virtually reconstructed ancient landscapes through a reconstruction of Avebury Henge in a virtual world environment, as it might have been circa 2,300 BCE. This paper describes and evaluates the construction phase of the project in a virtual world environment.},

  abstract={This Innovate Practice full paper, describes our experience in using the mini-case pedagogy to design and deliver a technical course, “Enterprise Integration” which is a year two course in the Information Systems undergraduate program. Case method is one approach that has been widely adopted in teaching many professions including law, medicine and business. The general practice is to ask students to read the case, usually four to eight pages long, prior to the session, and then spend the whole session discussing the case. However, for technology courses, the students are required to learn concepts and apply them using hands-on software tools through lab sessions. Hence, rather than use long cases, that cover the entire session, we need to use mini-cases that are usually one to two pages long. This pedagogy approach allows the class session to be designed with tight integration across the concept presentation lecture, mini-case analysis and hands-on lab session. We share the pedagogy implementation details and challenges, and discuss our findings and lessons learnt in designing and implementing the mini-case pedagogy. Thus providing one pathway for Information Systems and Computer Science professors to, implement the mini-case pedagogy in “technology heavy” courses.},

  abstract={Escape Rooms in the school environment are excellent educational tools that promote communication, teamwork and peer learning. It is important, though to highlight their contribution in opening up schools to broader community. “La Casa de Papel” Escape room is a STEAM-focused live-action game that was implemented in a Vocational School of Greece. The present paper presents all the questions/statements from an online questionnaire, that was created based on the Experience Pyramid Model, and from an interview of a student who participated in every phase of the project. In advance it offers a quick view of the results that came out and helped the evaluation. It aims to provide educators and researchers with an example of how they might develop and support such evaluation methods when they develop escape room projects, and a database with statements and questions to employ.},

  abstract={As scientific communities become increasingly complex and interdisciplinary, implementing policies that foster collective creativity for science-based innovation emerges as a critical issue. In this paper, we investigate the impact of socio-communication strategies on innovation capacity based on experiments using a general-purpose model that aims to study dynamic processes of collective creativity in scientific communities. Experimental results indicate that low communication frequency, openness and receptivity lead to higher variety. On the contrary, variety decreases with increasing receptivity under high communication frequency. If more communication channels exist, the connectivity-driven preferential attachment strategy is beneficial in fostering innovation in terms of generated networks with low density and high centrality. Additionally, balance theory suggests higher levels of knowledge diffusion efficiency.},

  year={2018},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Today's physical and human made systems have become more and more complex and dynamic. The concept of complex dynamic systems (CDS) arises in many scientific fields, technological areas and everyday's problems. Modelling and controlling complex dynamic systems is a very difficult and challenging task. Theories of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps have been proposed and mathematically formulated as a new way to model and control complex dynamic systems. FCM theories have been used successfully in many applications, they still present several limitations. These limitations as well as the increasing complexity of the systems dictate the need to reapproach Fuzzy Cognitive Maps to make them more efficient. Well-known drawbacks and limitations of FCM are described and certain solutions to overcome them are given in an integrated and unified way. The state space approach is used to address these drawbacks and the concepts of the FCM are categorized into fuzzy state concepts, input concepts and output concept. A number of solutions to the drawbacks are provided. A novel innovative approach been called, Advanced FCM theories is presented. Conclusions are given and future research directions are provided.},
