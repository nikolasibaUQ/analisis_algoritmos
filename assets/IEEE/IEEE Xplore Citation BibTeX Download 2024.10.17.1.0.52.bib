  abstract={Thousands of videos are posted online every day. The affordability of video editing tools and social networks has facilitated the creation and spread of videos carrying disinformation, i.e. fake videos. Previous attempts to categorize disinformation have focused on content analysis and ascertaining the intention of creators. To extend these approaches, it is beneficial to incorporate the perspective of other fields that study the trustworthiness of records, such as archival science, to help detect and categorize fake videos. This paper proposes to leverage archival science in combination with computer engineering to devise a new framework for detecting and categorizing fake videos. In doing so, the paper offers a case study of the way in which Computational Archival Science, which blends archival and computational thinking, can be used to contribute to a novel approach towards solving the problem of fake videos.},

  abstract={People are all currently living in the world where data has changed how company think, act and plan. Data, if used correctly, might be able to become a company's sharpest weapon in fighting the competition with other companies. Inventory cost is one of the most burdening costs in the food and beverage industry with the items like degradable raw materials or fresh ingredients. If not managed correctly might become a waste causing loss to the company. Degraded ingredients also might lower the overall food quality which might result in unsatisfied customers. Managing inventory, however, is not as easy as it seems, especially with the traditional method. This paper focuses on development of accurate predictive model using computational intelligence for optimal inventory management with a case study of restaurant ingredient management. Several machine learning algorithms like linear regression, multi-layer perceptron, random tree, random forest, and model trees were utilized to build accurate predictive models from time series data of the restaurant inventory. With good prediction system using computational intelligence, the inventory cost and wasted ingredients can be significantly reduced, which this eventually maximizes the profit.},

  abstract={The objective of this study is to develop and empirically evaluate an educational model that enhances algorithmic thinking - a key element of computational literacy - through the application with the concept of so called semantic waves for advancing K-12 students' digital proficiency. The concept of a semantic wave refers to the process of moving between abstract, theoretical knowledge and concrete, practical examples to create deeper understanding and learning. Considering this, our proposed model in the field of algorithmic thinking is intended to support pre-service computer science teachers and educators in designing instructional processes that are easy to implement and facilitate swift planning and reflection for K-12 computer science education. Initial results indicate promising outcomes but also suggested areas for enhancement. This research furthermore delves into refining the model through the incorporation of notional machines and the computational action approach for improving the training of future computer science teachers and students for the challenges of digital transformation.},

  abstract={This Research to Practice Full Paper presents a pilot test framed in educational robotics where parents and child work together during the same session. In recent years, an educational movement has emerged that is related to the introduction of computational thinking, programming, and robotics in schools. Educational robotics is presented as one more resource that serves as a support in the different curricular subjects and facilitates the emergence of skills such as socialization, creative spirit and personal initiative, allowing participants to find answers to the problems that may arise in their reality. It is for this reason that a pilot test was carried out where we included the participants' parents in a session. To do this we used the Crumble controller, a platform that is programmed using block programming language. This platform also allows making electrical connections in an amazingly simple way. From the mechanical point of view, we use materials that can be easily machined, both by children and by inexperienced people. At the end of the experience, the assistants completed the assembly of their own robot. The article contains a study of the state of the art of using educational robotics. It also includes an analysis of the different tools mostly used in educational robotics. Also, throughout the article the learning methodology used, the different educational resources and the results obtained from the experience are described.},

  abstract={This paper presents a proposal and an experience report of an educational robotics course integrated to the process of resocialization of youngsters and teenagers in socio-educational measures. This proposal adopts a teaching approach oriented to the development of comprehension, analysis, logical reasoning, creativity and collaboration skills in order to develop in these young people real world problemsolving skills. The main challenge of this proposal is to favor the assimilation of the contents and the development of robotics practice outside the classroom, since, in accommodation, no course material is accessible from paper and pencil to robotics practice instruments. Thus, the main differential of this work is literally working the computational thinking in spaces of deprivation of liberty in order to develop ideas for problem solving tasks. The results of this developed experience point to excellent opportunities for resocialization and professional orientation of young people in socio-educational measures through the teaching of robotics.},

  abstract={Because of its ability to prepare students for the 21st century world of work, educational robotics (RE) has assumed a prominent role in education. Following the methodology provided by Kitchenham, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to provide a comprehensive overview of studies, research, and practices related to robotics education in higher education. The study focuses on identifying the most commonly used RE hardware-based platforms in academic research publications, the type of knowledge intended to be imparted, and the skills or competencies reinforced by the platforms. Within the findings we can underline that there is no exclusive platform, but rather commercial ones are used, made by the researchers themselves, and even adapted from robots that were not designed for instructional purposes. Moreover, the subjects intended to be taught were all related to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and oriented to electrical engineering, electronics, robotics, and computer science professions. On the other hand, the skills that improved the most were computational thinking, cooperation and sophisticated problem solving, which are essential for 21st century job descriptions.},

  year={2020},
  volume={8},
  number={},
  pages={4273-4288},
  abstract={High complexity, meaning a model in which components interact in multiple ways and follow certain local rules, is a huge challenge for brain research. This paper presents a semantic vector-driven closed-loop model, namely THINKING-LOOP, for brain computing to improve the understanding and development of complex cognition. The proposed model is a three-layer fusion of data, information and knowledge with human intelligence, which exploits ontological knowledge modeling, rule-based reasoning and a human-computer interaction mechanism. The interaction and collaboration within the model depend on a pair of complementary schemes in a loop: the top-down scheme from the knowledge layer to the data layer that is used to search for stable cognitive patterns; and the bottom-up scheme from the data layer to the knowledge layer that is used to deeply analyze cognitive functions. As a key factor, human beings participate in the whole learning process of the model, which in turn assists human beings to make decisions. To verify the applicability of the present model in cognitive research, a series of fMRI experiments and analytic methods (e.g. statistical tests and network topology analysis) were conducted. The results show that the proposed model is able to take into account the characteristics of different types of brain patterns and cognitive functions, thereby achieving reasonable decision-making level.},

  volume={},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={Constrained by the finite depth of field (DOF) in optical cameras, imaging devices face difficulties in achieving complete sharpness across all objects or areas within the same scene. Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) technology has emerged in response to this challenge. This technique combines complementary information from multiple partially focused images to generate an all-in-focus fused image. The fully clear image is the foundation of subsequent visual tasks. However, existing methods rarely focus on the fusion of image sequence, even though image sequence are more common in practical scenarios. In this paper, we have proposed a novel MFIF generative model based on transformer encoder, termed as SPAFusion. We think that MFIF should focus on patches from the same regions within the source images. Therefore, the attention mechanism of our model is based on patches. We further introduce a shift patch mechanism to integrate long-range dependencies. Benefit from the patch attention and shift patch mechanisms, our model boasts a significantly reduced parameter count and computational complexity compared to existing transformer-based MFIF models. Additionally, the introduction of the shift patch mechanism enables the model to integrate long-range dependencies, allowing it to incorporate both intra-domain and cross-domain contextual information. Finally, we employ pooling to obtain the fused image, enabling our model to support the fusion of image sequence. Experiments show the superiority of our SPAFusion compared to the state-of-the-art MFIF models.},

  abstract={Scientific data have traditionally been distributed via downloads from data server to local computer. This way of working suffers from limitations as scientific datasets grow toward the petabyte scale. A “cloud-native data repository,” as defined in this article, offers several advantages over traditional data repositories—performance, reliability, cost-effectiveness, collaboration, reproducibility, creativity, downstream impacts, and access and inclusion. These objectives motivate a set of best practices for cloud-native data repositories: analysis-ready data, cloud-optimized (ARCO) formats, and loose coupling with data-proximate computing. The Pangeo Project has developed a prototype implementation of these principles by using open-source scientific Python tools. By providing an ARCO data catalog together with on-demand, scalable distributed computing, Pangeo enables users to process big data at rates exceeding 10 GB/s. Several challenges must be resolved in order to realize cloud computing’s full potential for scientific research, such as organizing funding, training users, and enforcing data privacy requirements.},

  year={2003},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={9 pp.-},
  abstract={In the complexity and simulation communities there is growing support for the use of bottom-up computer-based simulation in the analysis of complex systems. The presumption is that because these models are more complex than their linear predecessors they must be more suited to the modeling of systems that appear, superficially at least, to be (compositionally and dynamically) complex. Indeed the apparent ability of such models to allow the emergence of collective phenomena from quite simple underlying rules is very compelling. But does this 'evidence' alone 'prove' that nonlinear bottom-up models are superior to simpler linear models when considering complex systems behavior? Philosophical explorations concerning the efficacy of models, whether they be formal scientific models or our personal worldviews, has been a popular pastime for many philosophers, particularly philosophers of science. This paper offers yet another critique of modeling that uses the results and observations of nonlinear mathematics and bottom-up simulation themselves to develop a modeling paradigm that is significantly broader than the traditional model-focused paradigm. In this broader view of modeling we are encouraged to concern ourselves more with the modeling process rather than the (computer) model itself and embrace a nonlinear modeling culture. This emerging view of modeling also counteracts the growing preoccupation with nonlinear models over linear models.},

  abstract={Neuro-scientists are increasingly relying on parallel and distributed computing resources for analysis and visualization of their neuron simulations. Although science gateways have democratized relevant high performance/throughput resources, users require expert knowledge about programming and infrastructure configuration that is beyond the repertoire of most neuroscience programs. These factors become deterrents for the successful adoption and the ultimate diffusion (i.e., systemic spread) of science gateways in the neuroscience community. In this paper, we present a novel intuitionistic fuzzy logic based conversational recommender that can provide guidance to users when using science gateways for research and education workflows. The users interact with a context-aware chatbot that is embedded within custom web-portals to obtain simulation tools/resources to accomplish their goals. In order to ensure user goals are met, the chatbot profiles a user's cyberinfrastructure and neuroscience domain proficiency level using a `usability quadrant' approach. Simulation of user queries for an exemplary neuroscience use case demonstrates that our chatbot can provide step-by-step navigational support and generate distinct responses based on user proficiency.},

This course teaches students the basics of models, analysis tools, and design for embedded systems. Traditional undergraduate courses in embedded systems focus on ad-hoc engineering practices and the use of existing modeling techniques, often omitting critical analysis and meta-modeling; we emphasize model-based design of embedded and cyber-physical systems. Students learn how to model the physical world with continuous time differential equations, and how to model computation using logic and discrete models such as state machines. Students evaluate these modeling techniques through the use of meta-modeling, illuminating the interplay of practical design with formal models of systems that incorporate both physical dynamics and computation. Students learn formal techniques to specify and verify desired behavior. A combination of structured labs and design projects solidifies these concepts when applied to the design of embedded and cyber-physical systems with real-time and concurrent behaviors.},

The question how Situation Awareness spreads among a team of agents is important for numerous applications. In this paper, a population-based and an agent-based model of this process are proposed, and applied to a case study in aviation. A number of relevant simulations of the models are performed, to investigate whether the behaviour of the population-based model can approximate the pattern produced by the agent-based model. It was demonstrated that, especially for larger populations, the dynamics of the agent-based simulations can be approximated by population-based simulations, since both models demonstrate a similar pattern.},

  abstract={Control was from its very beginning an important concept in cybernetics. Later on, with the works of W. Ross Ashby, for example, biological concepts such as adaptation were interpreted in the light of cybernetic systems theory. Adaptation is the process by which a system is capable of regulating or controlling itself in order to adapt to changes of its inner and outer environment maintaining a homeostatic state. In earlier works we have developed a system metamodel that on the one hand refers to cybernetic concepts such as structure, operation, and system, and on the other to the philosophy of individuation of Gilbert Simondon. The result is the so-called allagmatic method that is capable of creating concrete models of systems such as artificial neural networks and cellular automata starting from abstract building blocks. In this paper, we add to our already existing method the cybernetic concepts of control and especially adaptation. In regard to the system metamodel, we rely again on philosophical theories, this time the philosophy of organism of Alfred N. Whitehead. We show how these new meta-theoretical concepts are described formally and how they are implemented in program code. We also show what role they play in simple experiments. We conclude that philosophical abstract concepts help to better understand the process of creating computer models and their control and adaptation. In the outlook we discuss how the allagmatic method needs to be extended in order to cover the field of complex systems and Norbert Wiener's ideas on control.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Benchmarking is not only about making comparisons but, through these, learning lessons to improve actual performance or knowledge. Comparing modelling paradigms based only on the conceptual model specifications is not enough; rather a well-defined benchmarking process and the execution of experiments are required. A benchmarking strategy is applied to three models of an oil refinery supply chain, using the agent-based or equation-based paradigm. Despite the different paradigms, the models share the same assumptions and model boundaries and an attempt is made to provide same initial conditions and stochastics. The benchmarking process shows that clear definitions of the modelling paradigms are needed to avoid confusion and to enable mining of specific and guiding conclusions from the benchmarking studies. Agent-based models and equation-based models rely on different modelling attributes: The first are mostly identified by the model elements (i.e. individuals) while the latter are mostly identified by the system description elements (i.e. equations). We present a way to visualize this and to add nuance to the choice of labels to allow for the conclusions of the benchmarking study to be generalised beyond the models that are compared, to learn about the advantages and shortcomings of modelling paradigms. Finally, some misconceptions regarding agent-based modelling are identified. The lessons learnt apply to supply chain domain but are extensible to other domains.},

  year={2018},

  pages={763-770},
  abstract={Container technology is being adopted to simplify workflow execution. In this paper, we investigate a workflow scheduling policy for container-based systems. A workflow, representing an application, consists of a set of tasks. Each task can be executed in a container within a virtual machine (VM), where the container packaging the function for the task should be loaded into the VM before task execution. To reduce the workflow execution time and the network bandwidth consumption, we propose a cost-efficient and latency-aware workflow scheduling algorithm that strategically loads the containers into VMs and executes the tasks on the VMs. The algorithm is based on “Stretch Out and Compact”, which can stretch out the tasks along the resources by critical path analysis and then find the inefficient slots within the computing resources and eventually compact the tasks into those slots. We introduce a concept of “virtual task” into the algorithm, where container loading is regarded as a virtual task that should be executed before the real task. The introduction of the virtual task can be more effective in finding the inefficient slots for the compaction, thus resulting in a more efficient workflow scheduling policy. Simulation results show that compared to the algorithms that fully or selectively load the dockers, the proposed algorithm can achieve less execution time while saving network bandwidth consumption for loading dockers.},

Conceptualization is the process of forming concepts in our brain. The concept of cognition process is then defined to introduce our unified iterative cognition model. The hierarchy within the iterative cognition is the logic of human cognition. Some visual cognition examples are employed to investigate our cognition model. With our conceptualization and cognition model, the processes of auditory cognition, visual cognition and more over, language understanding could be explained under a unified theoretical framework. Separate papers describing specific usages of the framework will be published.},

  abstract={The purpose of this article is to historize the definition of computer science, particularly the characteristic ambiguity of the discipline toward the computer. This ambiguity is foundational to computer science and has its roots in the response of university computer centers to the commercialization of computing in the mid-1950s. University computing experts developed an understanding of the activity of computing disentangled from the computer itself, a conceptual shift that went together with a parallel process of dematerialization of the notion of computer. These transformations were facilitated by the ascendance of a high modernist agenda in the sciences in the United States. University computing experts embraced the high modernist agenda and developed analogies across programs, notations, and a notion of the computer now understood as a model of computation. This immaterial conflation of notations, programs, and representations of the machine, would become one of the core tenets of computer science.},

  title={Dynamic Partial Computation Offloading for the Metaverse in In-Network Computing},

  pages={11615-11630},
  abstract={The computing in the network (COIN) paradigm is a promising solution that leverages unused network resources to perform tasks to meet computation-demanding applications, such as the metaverse. In this vein, we consider the partial computation offloading problem in the metaverse for multiple subtasks in a COIN environment to minimize energy consumption and delay while dynamically adjusting the offloading policy based on the changing computational resource status. The problem is NP-hard, and we transform it into two subproblems: the task-splitting problem (TSP) on the user side and the task-offloading problem (TOP) on the COIN side. We model the TSP as an ordinal potential game and propose a decentralized algorithm to obtain its Nash equilibrium (NE). Then, we model the TOP as a Markov decision process and propose the double deep Q-network (DDQN) to solve for the optimal offloading policy. Unlike the conventional DDQN algorithm, where intelligent agents sample offloading decisions randomly within a certain probability, the COIN agent explores the NE of the TSP and the deep neural network. Finally, the simulation results reveal that the proposed model approach allows the COIN agent to update its policies and make more informed decisions, leading to improved performance over time compared to the traditional baseline.},

  abstract={Graphics has always been a requisite form of communication for engineering practice. The history of major engineering accomplishments is replete with examples of graphical communications: from styli etchings on clay tablets to near-recent blueprint drawings. In the last two decades, engineering graphics instruction has been significantly influenced by the advancement of computers and other new technologies. During this short span, the discipline has gone from teaching manual drafting and pencil drawings to the use of 3-D computer modeling and simulation software. This paper briefly reviews the evolution of graphical communication in engineering practice, and focuses on the current status of graphical communication in the engineering curriculum. This report is bolstered by results of a recent survey conducted at the 2003 annual meeting of the Engineering Design Graphics Division of ASEE. The survey proposed an extensive list of student outcomes for engineering graphical communication, as mandated by the new ABET EC2000 outcomes requirement criterion 3 (g): "an ability to communicate effectively." Graphics faculty ranked these graphics student outcomes, and accompanying performance criteria, on level of importance in the modern curriculum. The results represent a consensus of current thinking on engineering graphical communication education.},

A metaboloid is a processing unit in this architecture. A set of metaboloids is organized as a mesh-connected NORMA (No Remote Memory Access). However, the network may change because of metabolism. Therefore, metaboloids have to achieve homeostasis to manage running tasks. We propose two new algorithms in this paper, namely bubbling and drifting.},

  abstract={A negotiation-based intelligent tutoring system of which the tutor and learner agents in playing problem-specific roles is developed to assist learner in problem solving through a negotiation mechanism. During the problem solving, fuzzy constraint-directed negotiation is employed to coordinate the mutual thinking between tutor and learner agents, and it can resolve the cognition differences and thereby reach a consensus more effectively. To embody the idea of the proposed methodology, a real-world example relevant to the software cost estimation is described to illustrate how a negotiation can be used for supporting the problem solving in a tutoring learning environment.},

We think that metabolic computing model has high fault tolerance and sustainability. We also proposed a realistic architecture of metabolic computing model. Metaboloid is a processing unit in this architecture. A set of metaboloids is organized as mesh connected NORMA. However, in simple metabolism, the specification of architecture is not changed. So, even if manufacturing technology of hardware is innovative, the performance will not be improved. In this paper, we propose an evolutional architecture for metabolic computing model. In this architecture, if the specification is portable and if the difference between specifications is only 1, a set of metaboloids of which specification is different can work together.},
