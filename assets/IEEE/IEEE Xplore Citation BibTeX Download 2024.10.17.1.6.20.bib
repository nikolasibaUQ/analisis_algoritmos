  abstract={There are billions of Internet of things (IoT) devices connecting to the Internet and the number is increasing. As a still ongoing technology, IoT can be used in different fields, such as agriculture, healthcare, manufacturing, energy, retailing and logistics. IoT has been changing our world and the way we live and think. However, IoT has no uniform architecture and there are different kinds of attacks on the different layers of IoT, such as unauthorized access to tags, tag cloning, sybil attack, sinkhole attack, denial of service attack, malicious code injection, and man in middle attack. IoT devices are more vulnerable to attacks because it is simple and some security measures can not be implemented. We analyze the privacy and security challenges in the IoT and survey on the corresponding solutions to enhance the security of IoT architecture and protocol. We should focus more on the security and privacy on IoT and help to promote the development of IoT.},

  abstract={Sentiment analysis research mainly aims to determine the orientation of an opinionated stretch of text into positive or negative polarity. The key motivation of sentiment analysis is getting to know what consumers think about products and services by analyzing their opinions on online portals, blogs, discussion boards, reviews etc. The main objective of this paper is to incorporate the information of POS-based sentiment-rich phrases in a machine-learning algorithm that determines the semantic orientation of a given text. In this paper, bi-tagged phrases are used as features in combination with unigram features for sentiment classification. Joint feature vectors of unigrams and bi-tagged phrases have high dimensions consisting of noisy and irrelevant features. Therefore, a feature selection method is used to select only relevant features from the feature vector. Experimental results show that the combination of prominent unigrams and bi-tagged phrases outperforms other features for sentiment classification in a movie review dataset.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) provides many opportunities for social and economic empowerment in developing countries. However, when one thinks of Africa, robotics does not spring immediately to mind as the most relevant application of AI, considering that the continent typically has high unemployment and fast-growing populations. Nevertheless, some countries in Africa have embraced robotics on the basis that it has an important role to play in their economic development. In this article, we explore this role and the ways in which Africa can best exploit the opportunities afforded by intelligent automation and robotics. It also highlights strategies to offset the threats posed by global factors, such as premature deindustrialization.},

  abstract={Thousands of research have been taking place to develop advanced Artificial Intelligence System which can't only perform faster but also predict better than human. But a human has some qualities which can never be gained by a machine like creativity, empathy, sensing, and critical thinking. By aggregating the best sides of both, a novel paradigm for the judicial system can be anticipated. For this purpose, we prepare a dataset both from an online survey (n=103) and interviews conducted in Bangladesh on cases related to `Women and Children Repression Prevention Act, 2000'. We apply several machine learning algorithms to make a machine that can predict punishment like a judge and calculate both the test accuracy and the predictive power of the models to observe which algorithm performs better and stable than the others. Even human can guide machine for judging a delinquent.},

  abstract={The appearing of the internet brings a large amount of information, this makes searching and filtering difficult. Therefore, a kind of special data mining technique appeared, it called Recommender System. Most research of recommender system always provides the most relevant items for users or items. However, recommendations from traditional recommender system may not satisfy the new human beings because users may already know these relevant items from other information sources. We believe that there are still some unsearched but less relevant items useful for users. On the other hand, because social network has grown very quickly, we think that there are some very useful interactive information that recommender systems can use to provide recommendations. Therefore, we propose a Social Network-based Serendipity (SNS) recommender system that uses interactive information from the social network to find out which items are interesting for users but hard to discover by themselves.},

  abstract={Augmenting the computing capability to the distant cloud help us to envision a new computing era named as mobile cloud computing (MCC). By leveraging the cloud resources mobile user can computation time and energy benefit. However, distant cloud has several limitations such as communication delay and bandwidth make us to think for closer cloud which brings the idea of proximate cloud of cloudlet. Cloudlet has distinct advantages and is free from several limitations of distant cloud. However, limited resources of cloudlet negatively impact the cloudlet performance with the increasing number of substantial users. In this paper, we propose a framework which helps to enhance the finite resource cloudlet performance by increasing cloudlet resources. Our aim is to increase the cloudlet performance with this limited cloudlet resource and make the better user experience for the cloudlet user in mobile cloud computing. We analyze and explain the each section of the proposed framework. In addition, we also list the important features and salient advantages of Performance Enhancement Framework of Cloudlet (PEFC).},

  abstract={This article connects the current fascination with immersive experience to the question of embodiment and representation by avatar presence. It also references the `pictorial' and `affective' turns in theory in order to discern `what avatars want', a play on the cultural theorist W. J. T. Mitchell's ideas. We propose that `truth' or `real' has very little to do with how we feel about our avatar creations which are in effect self-portraits. Their existence reveals our desires, yearnings, fears and insecurities. The avatar is an animated, performed image which mirrors our desire to inject it with subjectivity, while at the same time thinking of it as an object. Avatar embodiment also points us to the technological sublime. Reflecting the natural sublime, we argue that the technological version is part and parcel of our relationship to self and our avatar instantiations.},

  abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible and progressive brain disease that gradually destroys memory and thinking skills to an extent that it starts affecting the daily life. It has become the most common cause of dementia among older people. The work presented in this paper evaluates the utility of image processing on the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans to estimate the possibility of an early detection of AD. The total brain atrophy and specifically the hippocampal atrophy are considered strong diagnostic tests for AD. T1 weighted MRIs have been used for the purpose of image processing to evaluate atrophy. The paper demonstrates the applications of several image processing techniques such as K-means clustering, wavelet transform, watershed algorithm and also a customized algorithm tailored for the specific case. It has been implemented on the open source platforms, OpenCV and Qt, which facilitates the implementation and utility of the developed product in the hospitals without requiring any proprietary software. The results obtained from the project could aid the analysis to detect AD along with correlation with the psychiatric results and could thus assist the doctors in detecting AD at an early stage. This could progressively help in understanding and treating AD.},

  abstract={several recent business case studies showed the benefits of adopting Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in business, which encouraged many organizations to think seriously in adopting AI to re-innovate existing business processes or entire business models. Though, the challenge of having a clear framework to guide companies in such an AI transformation process is missing. This paper aims to investigate conceptual frameworks sued to assess AI readiness in organizations using popular existing theories and frameworks from the Information Systems (IS) discipline such as Technology-Organizations-Environment (TOE) framework, Diffusion of Innovation theory (DOI), and socio-technical Design. Followed by a review of the current theories in depth and propose an extended framework that will consider the socio-technical elements based on the local context of the UAE. A mixed methods research approach is proposed to test and validate the framework and answer the research questions. The expected results from applying the proposed framework will help academics and practitioners to identify the critical factors needed to have a successful implementation of AI strategies in the UAE.},

In this paper we use to say about the energy harvesting by using the speed breaker mechanism. This mechanism includes the rack and pinion arrangements. Now way day's the population is thriving dramatically and the vehicles are flourishing proportional with the ascending rate of population. Ultimately the vehicles increased with the raising up the wastage of energy and in this mechanism we picks up the wastage energy for renewed it to electrical energy by thinking out of box for generation of electricity. Then the amount of electricity generation depends on the how many vehicles passed over the hump and the weight carrying of vehicles which drops on the speed breakers, so in this we got the lot's of energy to fulfill our demand in upcoming days.},

  abstract={This paper addresses the dynamic traffic grooming problem in wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) mesh optical networks subject to wavelength constraint and transceiver constraint. As an improvement over the existing link bundled auxiliary graph (LBAG) model which thinks all traffic streams must go though the grooming fabric before entering the wavelength switch fabric, we introduce a transceiver saving auxiliary graph (TSAG) model and propose the TSAG method. In the TSAG model, we can determine whether a traffic stream should consume grooming ports or not. Various grooming policies are achieved by assigning the weight value of different edges in the auxiliary graph and their blocking performance are compared through simulations. Results show that the TSAG model has a lower blocking probability than LBAG while consuming the less running time, and TSAG can reduce the number of transceivers utilized while improving the wavelength utilization.},

  abstract={In this paper, we offer an approach to software evolvability based on our wrapping infrastructure for integration in constructed complex systems. We believe that the self-modeling systems that we have built using wrappings may be able to manage their own evolution to some extent. In a wrapping-based system, the design decisions are visible in the resource definitions, with the associated context assumptions, so it is much easier to change them. We expect such a system to build and examine models of its environment, and its behavior in the environment, to check them against the specifications that define the assumptions about the use of the system, so it can call for help when they are violated. We also think we can build the system to make the changes itself in some cases. In particular, there is a class of system change causes that are known to the original system designers (usually based on uncertainties about the environment or the current state of hardware components), and the system can be built with enough information to react to those changes accordingly.},

  pages={823-828},
  abstract={This paper presents an example of using the balanced truncation method (BTM) for a distributed RLC interconnect model reduction. The example shows a surprising result and some possible hidden phenomenon in model reduction methods. We find that a high order BTM model has much worse performance than a low order BTM model, in view of the original model and their step responses in the time domain. This unexpected finding contradicts to our common expectation from the well-known approximation error upper bound results of the BTM in frequency domain. It reveals a fact that though the high order system keeps more states than the low order system, the approximation error behavior in the time domain may be totally different from its counterpart in the frequency domain. In addition, the paper also presents a closed form of the state space model for general evenly distributed RLC interconnect line circuits. The closed form has a very low computation complexity of O(1), which may be extended for use not only in circuits, but also in various complex systems with transmission lines, networks, or delay lines. Since the BTM is a popular practical model reduction method in various areas, thus this example may bring some further insight thinking for development.},

  abstract={Cognitive radio is proposed to opportunistically access the spectrum while the licensed user is idle. As a result, spectrum sensing procedure to observe primary user's existence is vital to cognitive radio. In this paper, we propose two adaptive sequential cooperative spectrum sensing techniques in time varying channel, namely the Two Stage Sequential Energy Detector and Differential Sequential Energy Detector. By utilizing past local observations from previous sensing slots, cognitive radio nodes can aggregate the current and previously received energy values to improve the detection performance. We explore the adaptive schemes, where cognitive radio user takes in previously received energy values when it thinks that the primary user's activity remains unchanged. Simulation results show that both proposed schemes provide better detection over conventional energy detection based cooperative technique. Additionally, both proposed schemes can satisfy the IEEE 802.22 standard's requirement of 10% false alarm and 90% detection in scenario that conventional techniques can not accommodate.},

  abstract={Group authentication is a valid scheme to make sure whether all participants belong to the same group. For nonmembers, detecting and identifying them is also necessary. So an optimized group authentication which can detect and identify the nonmembers is proposed in this paper. The group authentication is designed for group-oriented applications. A lot of user authentication schemes only support one-to-one principle of authentication. However, network applications are no longer one-to-one communication, multiple users may be involved. So the scheme proposed a many-to-many communication. The scheme is based on Shamir's (t, n) threshold secret sharing scheme. The threshold scheme can protect a secret with high security and reliability when all the participants are honest. If some dishonest participants exist, the other honest participants may obtain a false secret which will lead to a false authentication, making them think all the participants are in the same group. It can reveal the content of the communication between them. We improve the t-secure m-user n-group authentication scheme, where t is the threshold of the scheme, m is the number of participants in the group authentication, and n is the number of members of the group. We choose a one-way function and then compute a parameter value which we will mention below. Which involve in a method to detect and identify the nonmembers in the group.},

In this study, addition task performance men show that some subjects have different counting accuracy. Mental arithmetic was monitored by International 10/20 system EEG with 19 scalp electrodes. The raw EEG data was processed and plotted to 2d mapping based on the power spectrum. The spectrum changes seen in Brain mapping, show how the mental arithmetic process takes place. The results of brain mapping can be a parameter that indicates the calculation process so that it can show the quality of the brain's work. Independent component label classifier performed, subject 7 obtain 79,8%, subject12 obtain 94,3%, subject15 obtain 92,3% accuracy as brain label.},

  abstract={Stalling from the thinking about the representation of geo-spatial data in computer network, the challenge of grid computing environment to geo-spatial information science and technology is pointed in This work. After review and summation of the achieved progress and existing problems of geo-spatial information systems in the past 20 years, the authors propose a new representation method for spatial data and spatial information - the spatial information multi-grid (SIMG), which can not only easily run under grid computing environment, but also properly consider the difference of natural and social characteristics in Earth space as well as the different level of economical development in different area. The system structure, data representation, data storage and data access in SIMG are described with emphasis on key techniques. The data conversion and transferring between SIMG and conventional spatial databases are also discussed. The applicability of SIMG in global, national, provincial and local decision-making is briefly indicated.},

  abstract={Virtualization is very important factor to reduce cost of data warehouse deployment. It can reduce cost as well as tremendous pressure of managing devices, storage servers, application models and man power. In current era, data warehouse is very effective concept that can make huge impact in organizational decision support system. Unlike database systems, data warehouse systems take large amount of time and cost to deploy and develop in-house system for an organization. This is the reason that people now think about cloud computing as a solution of the problem instead of implementing their own data warehouse system. This paper is about, how cloud computing environment can be established as an alternative of data warehouse system. It will also throw some light about better environment choice for the organizational need. Organizational data warehouse and EC2 (Elastic Cloud Computing) are discussed with different parameters like ROI, security, scalability, robustness of data, maintenance of system etc. Paper will help in comparative analysis of both the systems.},
