  abstract={The artificial intelligence algorithm Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is excellent in creating works that simulate human output. As a result, many researchers have created impressive and satisfying art pieces such as images of non-existent people or expressive paintings. The Hijazi heritage is full of unique art forms, including the Rawashin that adorn Hijazi buildings. With the remarkable technical progress of recent years, it has become necessary to highlight this identity in a contemporary way. This work aims to exploit and explore the capabilities of artificial intelligence techniques and GAN networks in creating and producing innovative new shapes with regard to Rawashin (wooden windows). The aim is to integrate such shapes with Arabic lettering in order to produce unprecedented designs in terms of Hijazi buildings. This is done by training the machine using a dataset consisting of images of different building shapes containing Rawashin and some Arabic calligraphy using two types of GAN models. As a result, the model was able to learn and produce a new style of Rawashin.},

  abstract={At present, the interior design computer effect drawing is divided into two ways. The first is the ubiquitous multi-software production scheme. The scheme uses two-dimensional software autoCAD or CAD software to provide basic drawing information, and then uses three-dimensional software 3 DMANX to make three-dimensional drawings. In addition, the model is rendered by VARY Tenderer. Finally, the overall modeling effect is rendered by PS technology. Although this scheme is a widely chosen production process for producers, there are still unreasonable problems, including size, modeling sequence, modeling test and mapping efficiency. The second is the CASD software developed by the Chinese Academy of Architectural Sciences, which has the characteristics of super integration and precision, and is more efficient and practical than the previous production process. Therefore, this paper will optimize and improve the two cartographic schemes in the above market.},

  abstract={Online social networks (OSNs) have become so popular that it has changed the Internet to a more collaborative environment. Now, a third of the world's population participates in OSNs, forming communities, and producing and consuming media in different ways. The recent boom of artificial intelligence technologies provides new opportunities to help improve the processing and mining of social data. In this article, an algorithm that can detect communities in the OSNs using the concepts of granular computing in rough sets is proposed. In this information model, a social network as a rough set granular social network (RGSN) is modeled. A new community detection algorithm named granular-based community detection (GBCD) is implemented. This article also defines and uses two measures, namely, a granular community factor and an object community factor. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on four real-world data sets as well as computer-generated data sets. The model is compared with other state-of-the-art community detection algorithms for the values of modularity, normalized mutual information (NMI), Omega index, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F1-measure. The cumulative performance of the GBCD algorithm is found to be 3.99, which outperforms other state-of-the-art community detection algorithms.},

  abstract={Computational chains which 'remember' that a computation has already been performed and its results are available for further use have been implemented using special classes of Matlab containers. A simple version management mechanism keeps track of any changes made to containers in the chain, and supports storage and retrieval of design data. Computational chains can be used as a basis for a more sophisticated version of management mechanism for maintaining a complete design-history database. Advantages of the computational chains become more apparent as the complexity of the work undertaken with them increases, so in this paper we describe quite a complex 'case study', which we think is a fairly typical of part of an industrial control system analysis. It is based on the use of a multivariable Smith predictor for a multivariable plant which contains time delays.},

  abstract={The objective of present research is comprehensive study related to 5G technology of mobile communication for year 2020 in Indian prospective. The European and American forums started thinking seriously about the next generation of wireless and mobile communication for 2020. A European forum named METIS, Mobile and wireless communications Enablers for the Twenty-twenty (2020). Information Society started working on funded project to identify the 5G future scenarios especially in European environment. METIS funded project also involves many leading technology companies. The guidelines decided by these projects will become basis of shape of fifth generation of wireless technologies. The 4G concept shave already moved to standardization phase, we must begin to work on the building blocks of the 5G networks.5G technology will provide low battery consumption, more secure features and 4A's paradigm ie any rate, anytime, anywhere and affordable. There is a need to study local scenarios and information technology related local demand to give a direction to 5G technology development. The future technology is required to be indigenous, capable to handle local social and economic issues so that use of Information technology may be able to address our issues more effectively. Presently, most of the Europe and USA may not be compared with India, China and third world. Better infrastructure, better economy and less population are some features of Europe and USA. There challenges are different and they develop technology for their growth. In most of the cases we adopt it large cost. Applying technologies in core and routed social aspect is big challenge for nation like India. As our technology and our needs and wants are different from front runners, we need to design the technology more judiciously and economically. We need a technology which enables poor person percentage to grow fast. In this view, we have indentified our own scenario and technological requirement to implement 5th generation of mobile and wireless technologies.},

  abstract={The design and engineering of children's artifacts-like engineering in general - exhibits a recurring philosophical tension between what might be called an emphasis on "ease of use" on the one hand, and an emphasis on "user empowerment" on the other. This paper argues for a style of technological toy design that emphasizes construction, mastery, and personal expressiveness for children, and that consequently runs counter to the (arguably ascendant) tradition of toys that work "like magic". We describe a series of working prototypes from our laboratories - examples that illustrate new technologies in the service of children's construction - and we use these examples to ground a wider-ranging discussion of toy design and potential future work.},

  pages={206-211},
  abstract={Suicide is a very critical and important issue in modern society. Suicide is the third-leading cause of death for college and high school students. Social media allows students in the digital environment to share their suicidal ideas and thoughts with others. Accurate and early detection and prevention of suicidal ideation in students can save the students' lives. To identify the risk factor for suicidal attempts, a suitable method of analysing the suicidal behaviour of students using their sentiment text posted on social media can be used. This paper presents an optimized Dragonfly algorithm (DFA) using a Deep Belief Network (DBN) for the automatic detection of suicidal ideation in students. In our CyberHelp Solution, the proposed DFA-based DBN model analyses student social media data, predicts suicidal behavior, and treats students appropriately. The sentiment analysis performs automated categorization of online messages and makes accurate predictions of the student’s suicidal behaviors. The dragonfly heuristic optimization algorithm is used for tuning the hyperparameter in the deep belief network. The proposed DFA-DBN technique has been implemented to predict suicidal ideation in students with a higher accuracy of 95.5% compared with other classification models.},

  abstract={Everyone has a distinct handwriting style, even identical twins who share the same genes. This distinctiveness has allowed researchers to develop systems that can classify the writer's traits, including gender, age, handedness, and others. A gender classification system, for instance, classifies handwriting patterns to predict the writer's gender. With the advancement of deep learning, it is now possible to automatically extract features from the document and classify them. In this paper, two gender classification models based on Alex-Net and LeNet-5 CNN were proposed, trained, and tested on a private Urdu handwriting dataset containing 284,000 pre-segmented characters from 200 males and 200 females. The proposed models achieved state-of- the-art performance compared to existing deep learning models for gender classification. The Alex-Net model achieved an overall accuracy of 99.14%, while the LeNet-5 model achieved an overall accuracy of 98.55%.},

  abstract={Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOD) has emerged as a significant health concern in India, with prevalence rates reported between 9% to 36%. However, societal stigmas and misconceptions hinder the timely recognition and diagnosis of PCOD. A multi-modal AI-based framework for PCOD Detection and Risk Assessment is presented considering algorithms that include SVM, CNN, KNN, Otsu, and Näıve Bayes. This work integrates both image and numerical data utilizing ultrasound images, blood test results, and various patient parameters. 12 key parameters: height, weight, BMI, FSH, TSH, LH, AMH, PRL, Vitamin D3, progesterone, and RBS are considered. We conducted a survey involving 81 participants. Our survey revealed that 45% of participants were unaware of their PCOD status despite exhibiting symptoms, and 73% of participants exhibited symptoms of PCOD. 19.8% of respondents confirmed PCOD diagnoses. Our framework enhances diagnostic precision but also mitigates the emotional toll wrought by PCOD through early intervention and support.},

  abstract={Learning progress is fascinating, especially in STEM fields. When learning novel concepts and principles, the learners will try to link and compare the newly learned contents with their existing knowledge system. If the newly learned knowledge matches the built-up ones, the learners will easily merge it into their long-term (permanent) knowledge structure. When the newly learned knowledge does not match their existing structure, the learners feel confused and hard to accept and digest. In many cases, the learners learned similar concepts and principles from middle school to post-college at different levels, in mathematics and engineering mechanics. Learners might notice that some of the concepts and principles at different levels looked similar and plausible, but the critical differences didn't catch enough attention, neither the concepts themselves nor the application conditions. Even though the students heard the explanation from the instructors in the class, it does not match their existing daily life experience, which makes it harder to accept and merge it into their knowledge system. In other words, a puzzle piece was put in the blank position where it does not fit. The present study is working on rebuilding the STEM knowledge structures and exploring the differences that existed among high school students (9th- 12th graders), first-year engineering undergraduates, higher-level engineering students, and professional engineers with designed quantitative and qualitative research methods. This research aims to explore the possibility of making the transition smoother from one learning stage to another and develop a novel curriculum that could merge the knowledge structures in a new way to reduce or eliminate the gaps between different levels of STEM learning. The author of the present project was working with 9th-12th grade students from local high schools, and college students in STEM majors at a public university, to rebuild and figure out the differences in their knowledge structures for STEM learning. The project includes preparation work as the development of concept inventories in STEM fields, structured survey questionnaires for both experimental groups. The topics the author chose are concepts shared and inherited from high school STEM education, such as force, velocity, acceleration, Newton's Second Law, etc. Currently, the study focused on the feedback of their scores completing the concept inventories, while the next phase of intervention will be applied.},

  abstract={In today's world, whenever an individual think about video games, it reminiscing him/her of a time from their childhood, when they used to play them. As a result, they end up remembering what these video games were used to be like and perpetually end up comparing them to the current generation in the hierarchy.. In this following paper, there is a detailed general comparison of how these games have evolved over the past few generations. It makes comparison on the basis of five essential parameters, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Game Portability, Evolution of Consoles, Graphics, Network based Gaming etc.},

  abstract={Communication & IT have increased significance of banking industry in India, which has led to a situation where, no one can even think of the survival of banking industry in India. In last few decades, banks have been investing a huge amount for adopting Information Technology (IT) for the purpose of setting up net banking, ATM's, telebanking, debit cards, credit cards, mobile banking, electronic payments etc. This advancement in technology adopted by banks aimed at providing quality services to the customers. Banking deregulations has provided Indian banks to increase their revenues by providing diversified financial services like, investment banking, credit card mortgage, financial depository etc. In current era, banking industry in present complex business environment, has changed from simply intermediary to huge financial market, which is capable for providing many financial services at one place. The present study aims at examining the customers' service accessibility by adopting information technology (IT) supported system in banking industry. The study included various primary factors affecting service accessibility i.e. banking services, safety of services, front office services, add-on services, and service reliability etc. The collected data was analysed using multiple regression in order to predict the customers' perception about the accessibility of banking services.},

  abstract={This paper, based on the cognitive architecture of learning and thinking [7], proposes a cognitive learning model in classroom interaction, which bridges the gap between classroom interaction and learning outcome. In this model, a learning activity is defined as a cognitive matrix at a low level in which M rows and N columns are set, each row represents a logical cognitive step of learning procedure, and each column contains all the contents processed by a corresponding component in cognitive architecture. At the meantime, the learning outcome can be produced from contents of column LTDM, AO and AADM of cognitive architecture [7]. A memory consolidation model is also proposed and simulated with PDP tool. Experiment of teaching concept knowledge indicates the effectiveness of the proposed models.},

  abstract={Various learning methods are adapted for experimental robot. We can make movement of a robot by giving teaching signals to a robot. But it is heavy for operator to define how to give teaching signals generally because operator must guess and think of a task and environment and define a function to do that. Here the author aim to create teaching signals automatically for each task and environment. In this paper, the author suggest a simple rule which is independent of information about any task and environment to create teaching signals for each task and environment. This rule is that a situation which is often happened is good situation. In this paper, the author adopt reinforcement learning as learning method and a small-sized humanoid robot as application. The author show creating a reward by adapting a rule and show that a robot can learn and make movement.},

  abstract={Data plays a vital role in many frontiers like organizations, industry, business, scientific research, any discipline and it is immeasurable. Data that is stored electronically draws huge attention. Excessive data is making great troubles for the people to think over the necessity to store data which is used to grow an organization further and is also important in decision making too. Major challenge arises in storing and retrieving data, thereby Big Data come into picture. This paper provides a brief survey on variety of data available, preserving high graded data, how the data can be processed and analyzed. On the other hand, this paper also focuses on, the existence, few challenges and technologies used for Big Data.},
