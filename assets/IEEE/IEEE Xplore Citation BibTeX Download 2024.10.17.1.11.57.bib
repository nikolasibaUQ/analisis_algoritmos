  abstract={The complex environmental influences often complicate the detection of longitudinal tears in conveyor belts, resulting in insufficient detection accuracy, overlooked detection, and elevated false detection rates. In this study, we propose a new depth learning method specifically designed for detecting longitudinal tears in conveyor belts. This method employs a linear Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) camera to capture images of the conveyor belt. These images are subsequently processed with a modified version of You Only Look Once (YOLO)v7 model to identify instances of longitudinal tearing. The modified YOLOv7 model features Efficient Intersection over Union (EIoU) loss function as a substitute for the original loss function. Furthermore, a Simple Parameter-Free Attention Module (SimAM) is introduced in the detection head to improve detection accuracy. In this method, we introduced the SimSPPFCSPC module as a new spatial pyramid pooling model. This module enhances detection speed while maintaining detection accuracy. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an impressive precision of 94.6% and a detection speed of approximately 110 Frames Per Second (FPS). Such accuracy and speed meet the requirements for online detection of longitudinal tearing in belt conveyors.},

  pages={101528-101535},
  abstract={The main challenge of pose estimation for six degrees of freedom (6DoF) is the lack of labeled data in real environment. In order to overcome this problem, many studies recently have trained deep learning models with synthetic data. However, a domain gap between real and synthetic environments exists, prompting various approaches to address this issue. In this work, we propose domain adaptation for self-supervised 6DoF pose estimation, which leverages the components and introduces an effective method to reduce domain discrepancy. First, we adopt a multi-level domain adaptation module, on image level and instance level, to learn domain-invariant features. Second, we used entropy-based alignment to minimize the entropy of representation embedding. Finally, we evaluate our approach on LineMOD and Occlusion-LineMOD datasets. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves higher performance compared to the prior methods and demonstrate effectiveness in domain shift scenarios on 6DoF pose estimation.},

  abstract={Data science and high-performance computing (HPC) should be a great match: with datasets growing well beyond the memory of a single node and computations becoming ever more communication-intensive, the need for HPC in data science seems clear. And yet, there remains a frustrating gap between the two disciplines. One major reason is that data science is an interactive sport-data scientists overwhelmingly gravitate towards interactive platforms (e.g., Jupyter notebooks) and interpreted languages (e.g., Python)-whereas the culture of HPC tends to eschew interactivity in favor of compiled programs and batch jobs. While HPC practitioners prize computational efficiency, data scientists live by the very different maxim of rapid hypothesis testing and have demonstrated that they are willing to ignore HPC technologies entirely rather than give up interactivity. Bridging this gap entails a change in thinking about the purpose of an HPC and how it should be used. This talk motivates and demonstrates the interactive use of up to hundreds of HPC nodes in data science workflows with an open-source package called Arkouda, which exposes massively parallel, distributed NumPy-like arrays to a Jupyter notebook running Python 3. We have chosen the NumPy format and Jupyter and Python as front-end technologies in order to conform to interfaces familiar to data scientists. Because Arkouda arrays can be constructed from and exported to NumPy arrays, users can perform heavy computations on hundreds of HPC nodes and bring back small sets of results for rich introspection in a single-node Python environment. In the future, we plan to use this interoperability as a template for bringing existing HPC codes into an interactive framework, much as NumPy has brought optimized C and Fortran routines into interactive Python workflows. Meanwhile, the computational heart of Arkouda is a relatively compact yet highly scalable Chapel interpreter that implements a powerful set of data science primitives. Functionally, this interpreter comprises a dispatcher, modular data transformations, and a zero-copy, in-memory object store, all implemented in about 12,000 lines of Chapel. While these components and design principles appear in other open-source projects, the competitive advantage of Arkouda comes from the unique position Chapel holds as a productive language with performance and scaling on par with industry-standard HPC technologies. For this reason, Arkouda is small enough to be maintainable while achieving good scaling on communication-intensive primitives (e.g., argsort) up to at least 512 nodes of a Cray XC.},

  abstract={Developers must revise current approaches to standards for analysis software to account for its unique characteristics. When developers think of software standards, they envision software for aircraft cockpits, nuclear reactors, high-speed trains, medical devices, and spacecraft: software that directly controls some component related to the product's safe operation, with or without a person in the loop. Standards for such safety-critical software that have evolved over the past two decades make specific assumptions about the software's development environment. If the software provides computational data that is wrong, and the resulting decision based on that data is faulty, safety is compromised. The software itself is not safety-critical. Nevertheless, safety is involved, sometimes with a lengthy time component and many people in the loop. As with safety-critical software, certain standards address the production of quality computational software or, as it is often called, analysis software. Standards for developing analysis software are based on standards used for other software types. However, the characteristics of analysis software are very different.},

  abstract={Summary form only given. We are at a novel crossroads in technology where we are witnessing the confluence of computing, communicating and networking. A number of exciting applications are both driving and being driven by this confluence, including low-power sensor networks, large-scale ad hoc wireless networks, and wireless multimedia transmission. Many of these applications demand a move away from classical centralized architectures and algorithms towards more decentralized and distributed ones. Signal processing plays a key role in this revolution- not in isolation but rather as a pivotal interdisciplinary systems component, intimately integrated with communications, information theory, coding theory, and networking protocols. Sensor networks represent a particularly rich applications base. We would provide a snapshot of the sensor network related activities in a number of research groups at Berkeley. Motivated by the communications and computational constraints imposed by large-scale low-power sensor networks, we would describe some of our signal processing centric research including: (i) distributed sampling; (ii) distributed source coding; (iii) distributed estimation; and (iv) robust transmission. We would highlight the key foundational role played by multi-user information theory, particularly the so-called area of side-information coding for both source coding (compression) and channel coding (transmission). A deeper look reveals a beautiful functional duality between source and channel coding with side-information. This unexpectedly unifies a host of seemingly unrelated problem areas like distributed compression, digital watermarking, multimedia transmission over packet-error networks, and seamless digital upgrade of analog TV. Finally, as a microcosm of the expressive power of interdisciplinary thinking, we would describe a novel video compression paradigm dubbed PRISM (power-efficient, robust, hlh-compression, syndrome-based multimedia coding). PRISM's architecture, in stark contrast to that driving current video codecs like MPEG, allows for a novel shifting of the computational complexity from the encoder to the decoder, making it ideally suited for "uplink" transmission scenarios in wireless multimedia and surveillance applications.},

  abstract={As reproducible research tools and skills become increasingly in-demand across disciplines, so too does the need for innovative and collaborative training. While some academic departments incorporate software like R or Python in coursework and research, many students remain reliant on self-teaching in order to gain the necessary skills to work with their data. However, given the growing number of students interested in computational tools and resources for research automation, relying on student self-teaching and learning is not an efficient method for training the next generation of scholars. To address the educational need for computational thinking and learning across various academic departments on campus, the UC San Diego Library has been running Software Carpentry workshops (two day bootcamps to introduce foundational programming concepts and best practices) since 2015. The Library, as a discipline-agnostic entity with a history of serving as a trusted resource for information, has been well positioned to provide training for this new era of research methodology. The core of our success is the collaboration with the growing community of Software and Data Carpentry instructors at UC San Diego with expertise in various research disciplines. Building on this strong partnership and leveraging the Library's resources and expertise in digital literacy, the campus can better support data-driven and technologically-focused education and research.},

  abstract={Molecular programming of DNA makes use of computeraided design, a programming language to encode the design, and a a compiler that compiles the code into a list of corresponding DNA strands. To implement the code, the developer orders the DNA from a supplier and then runs the molecular program in the laboratory. Instruments such as spectrofluorometers and atomic force microscopes help verify that the molecular program ran correctly, self-assembling to achieve the intended structure and behavior. Applications of molecular programming that are on the horizon for commercial production include targeted and personalized medical applications, biosensors for air and water, molecular robots that can navigate in cells, and biocompatible computational devices. In this talk I describe the experiences and results of our interdisciplinary team in applying goal-oriented requirements techniques, reaction network modeling, and probabilistic model checking to molecular programmed nanosystems. Requirements challenges include handling scalability to very large numbers of devices or services (roughly similar to the internet of things), dealing with probabilistic behavior, and understanding the limits of safe operation in changing (literally fluid) environments. I discuss how computational tools and thinking assist the development efforts and what limitations currently hamper our requirements analysis in practice. More broadly, I suggest that the approaches useful for molecular programming may help with understanding the requirements for other large, distributed, autonomous systems.},

  title={Distinguishing single-stranded and double-stranded DNA binding proteins based on structural information}, 
  year={2013},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={612-612},
  abstract={Protein-DNA interactions play a critical role in many biological processes. However, the structural mechanisms underlying these interactions are not fully understood. DNA binding proteins can be classified into double-stranded DNA binding proteins (DSBs) and single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSBs). Understanding the binding specificity of a DNA binding protein is helpful for the research of protein functions. Though there are some researches [1] on the SSB and DSB respectively, few attentions have been paid on investigating what makes SSB and DSB have such different ability of the specific binding. With the development of biotechnology, a large amount of proteins has been sequenced. However, SSBs have shown to have little sequence conservation [2]. Even DSBs involved in similar functions may have conserved subsequences, different kinds of DSBs with different functions seems to show few common subsequences. Therefore, it is hard to recognize SSB sequences from DSB sequences, or vice versa. In fact, up to Jan. 25, 2013, the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [3] contains 3391 structures for DNA binding proteins, among them only about 30% and 5% are annotated as DSBs and SSBs, respectively, and whether the remainders belong to DSBs or SSBs are still not very clear. Therefore, a computational method is required to annotate the DNA binding protein as DSB or SSB automatically. The surface of a protein is generally irregular, containing many clefts and grooves of varying shapes and sizes. Previous researches have shown that a large cleft can provide an increased opportunity for the protein to form interactions with other molecules, particularly small ligands [4]. Therefore, some researches used a particularly large and deep cleft to characterize the binding active sites of the proteins [5]. We guess that for DNA binding proteins, the cleft properties on the surface may also play important roles on the dsDNA/ssDNA binding specificity. In this work, we applied CAVER 3.0 package [6] to detect the clefts and the corresponding indexes of the largest clefts on the protein surfaces, to investigate whether they are possible to be used for distinguishing the potential interfaces between SSBs and DSBs. Concretely, we mainly got three indexes of the detected tunnels: length, curvature and bottleneck radius. Research results have shown that although the sequences of different SSBs are very different, there are well-conserved elements in the structures. That is, most SSBs contain one or more OB (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding) - fold domains [2]. A typical OB-fold has a five-stranded beta-sheet coiled to form a closed beta-barrel. This barrel is capped by an alpha-helix located between the third and fourth strands. The OB-fold plays critical role in binding with ssDNA. Although it is hard to say that the OB-fold is unique for SSBs, we think that it should also be used as an important descriptor to distinguish SSBs from DSBs. Therefore, we use the protein structure alignment package TM-align [7] to compare its structure with each of the six OB-fold protein templates and use the maximal alignment score TM-score as the OB-fold feature of the protein. We aim to investigate the structural differences between collected SSBs and DSBs, and extract the structure-based features related to surface clefts and OB-folds, Based on which, we construct a computational model that can automatically classify the DNA protein as a DSB or SSB by using the widely used support vector machine (SVM), with prediction accuracy of HOLO-set 0.87, APO-set 0.83, and mixed-set 0.83, respectively. The promising performance suggests that our method will be useful in the protein function annotation and refinement.

  abstract={In the field of storytelling and filmmaking, we are often aware of the viewer's subjective state, such as emotional state and so on. A similar concept is direction, which is often accumulated by the heuristic findings of creators. The issue is that the emotional state of the viewer is subjective, making it hard for computational approach. Our approach is utilizing appraisal trajectory. The appraisal trajectory is a line chart drawn the viewer's own emotional state from the beginning to the end of the content. We think that the appraisal trajectory enables us to handle the viewer's emotional state with a computer. We think to need accumulate basic findings about subjective trajectories; therefore, we develop a tool to collect subjective trajectories: emonotate. This tool provides some features: input and store the various emotional states of viewers and viewers intuitively agreeable input by visual feedback of arbitrary appraisal trajectories. In order to evaluate the validity, we conduct the experiment of 104 participants drawing subjective trajectories based on protagonist emotional state about 2 animation contents and the subjective quantity is the protagonist emotional state. Both works yielded intuitively correct results, demonstrating the realism of our tool. We think our experimental facts indicate the possibility of our tool collecting subjective trajectories and the issues.},

  abstract={An important part of our information-gathering behavior has always been to find out what other people think. With the growing availability and popularity of opinion-rich resources such as online review sites and personal blogs, new opportunities and challenges arise as people can, and do, actively use information technologies to seek out and understand the opinions of others. The sudden eruption of activity in the area of opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which deals with the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text, has thus occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a first-class object. Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis covers techniques and approaches that promise to directly enable opinion-oriented information-seeking systems. The focus is on methods that seek to address the new challenges raised by sentiment-aware applications, as compared to those that are already present in more traditional fact-based analysis. The survey includes an enumeration of the various applications, a look at general challenges and discusses categorization, extraction and summarization. Finally, it moves beyond just the technical issues, devoting significant attention to the broader implications that the development of opinion-oriented information-access services have: questions of privacy, vulnerability to manipulation, and whether or not reviews can have measurable economic impact. To facilitate future work, a discussion of available resources, benchmark datasets, and evaluation campaigns is also provided. Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis is the first such comprehensive survey of this vibrant and important research area and will be of interest to anyone with an interest in opinion-oriented information-seeking systems.},

  abstract={This paper purports to share with the higher education community the global PBL active learning curriculum and the learning environment, which have been collaboratively developed with the universities in Taiwan and Kansai University (KU). The collaborated universities developed an optimal curriculum to enhance and nurture students' "Future Work Skills 2020" defined by the Institute for the Future, such future human skills as Sense Making, Social Intelligence, Novel & Adaptive Thinking, Cross-Cultural Competencies, Computational Thinking, New Media Literacy, Transdisciplinarity, Design Mindset, Cognitive Load Management, and Virtual Collaboration. The curriculum fully employs PBL strategies in global teams, where teams for PBL are organized with students with heterogeneous cultural backgrounds in the virtual learning environment. The basic concept of such curriculum is based on COIL (Collaborative Online International Learning), originally developed by State University of New York. COIL makes full usage of IT to generate virtual learning environment for students worldwide. In order to go beyond the COIL concept incorporating the future skills defined by IFTF, the allied universities employed PBL in global AGILE teams to deepen insights from various cultural viewpoints in terms of consensus building through team discussions. Due to the spatial and temporal differences, enrolled students conducted their team learning activities in the virtual learning environment asynchronously, making use of IT technologies and cloud services in order to be on "the same page" in the progress of the project throughout the course. Further, the assessment strategies to enhance students' efficacy is the key factor in the course, which is also discussed with examples. This paper reports the global PBL active learning curriculum and environment collaboratively developed with the universities in Taiwan and Kansai University.},

  abstract={Computation is becoming an integral part of education, especially at college-level. Two MOOC courses provide an introduction to computation and are offered by MIT on EdX: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science Programming in Python has run 16 times and 6.00.2x Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science has run 11 times. These courses frame the world around computation, and show learners that they can think about problems they see in everyday life in the context of computation. Our paper shows an analysis of repeat learners (learners who enroll in the same course multiple times) and their behaviors over the many runs of these courses. Around 20% of learners in any given run of a course are repeat learners. Of these, the majority are two-time repeat learners (learners who took the same course exactly twice). We show that learners tend to perform better when they retake a course, and especially when they retake the course sooner rather than later. We also look at a subgroup of learners we call repeat cross-referencers (learner who accessed at least two previous runs of the course during the run time of a later run of the course). We found that repeat cross-referencers complete the course at a suspiciously high rate, and we speculate it is because they are looking back at answers from a previous course run. Lastly, we look at how learners perform in an introductory class and an advanced class. We found that many learners who take both courses are more likely to complete both courses and have more active days in the courses than those learners who only do one of the two classes.},

  abstract={Software engineering for mobile applications has its own challenges, different from when we engineer software just for desktop environments. With the emergence of smart things (including smart everyday objects embedded with connectivity, computational ability, sensors, and sometimes actuators, urban robots such as delivery and cleaning robots, smart street lighting, smart vehicles, and smart park benches, and so on) not just within the home but in public spaces, there is a need to consider software engineering challenges for software on such things. Human-centred software engineering and work on ethical behaviours in smart things will need to come together, even as we continue to understand what it takes to effectively develop software (and systems) for such emerging devices. In order to demonstrate how software (and systems) for intelligent devices in public places might be developed, findings from a quantitative survey we performed are discussed in this study. The survey was designed such that the questions focused on the socio-ethical behaviours of smart devices when interacting with people in public places. The survey was based on a supermarket scenario where the participants had to answer the different questions in the questionnaire. There were 250 participants who only completed part of the survey; of them, 60 participants finished it in full. The complete replies have been examined and analysed in this paper. To determine how people feel about employing smart technology in public places, a variety of smart devices, including robots, smart cameras, smart speakers, and smart trolleys, are utilised in the survey questions. According to the findings, more than 80 percent of respondents think it important for smart gadgets to be socially-aware and ethical in public places.General Abstract This paper examines the survey results conducted to explore if smart devices such as robots or smart cameras can be deployed in public areas. The respondents reply to survey questions asking them whether they believe it is crucial to keep smart robots, smart carts, or any other smart devices in the supermarket. The survey’s questions are constructed in such a manner that participants are asked to imagine themselves as either a customer shopping for groceries at a store or a manager running the business and dealing with the friendly robot. This survey was created with the intention of thinking carefully about how intelligent software systems may be designed from the standpoint of software engineering for public settings. Later in this article, the survey findings and insights are discussed.},

  abstract={Nowadays, there has been a rapid evolution and transformation of technology. Many innovative technologies have emerged including artificial intelligence, biomedical engineering, automation systems, quantum computing, big data, blockchain, etc. These emerging technologies have also transformed our lifestyles. This transformation has then inevitably required a new set of skills; Computational Thinking/Logical Thinking which can be compiled into Coding skills. Several novel educational media and teaching materials have been promoted. Current educational kits in the market can be classified into 3 main categories. These structures vary from physical kits vs virtual kits vs hybrid kits, while coding styles vary from block-based vs text-based. This paper presents an educational multi-purpose kit for coding and robotic design which has a hybrid kits structure with block-based coding style. Its connection scheme has been designed as wired/wireless plug-and-play via magnetic. The implemented prototype could be resilient for various learning activities, including emulating three (touch, hearing and sight) out of five basic human senses via sensors and actuators. A use case on shape recognition, using computer vision, has been illustrated to show how the implemented system works.},

  abstract={Bryan Johnson is on a quest for zeros. The enigmatic founder of Braintree, former CEO of Venmo, and founder of Kernel, which develops brain measurement and imaging systems, Johnson has made it his mission to discover the kinds of once-in-a-generation factors that radically alter the way we understand the world. He seeks &#x0022;zeros&#x0022;&#x2014;the discovery of fundamental building blocks, tenets, or rules that previously seemed impossible or beyond our vision.<superscript>1</superscript> They&#x0027;re the discovery of something that didn&#x0027;t exist in our limited minds, lingering in an alternate dimension until finally pulled out of the ether and into our field of perception. Albert Einstein&#x0027;s theory of relativity, for instance, set scientists on a new path of stunning breakthroughs in quantum mechanics, astrophysics, and cosmology, but none of those subsequent discoveries opened up the same step-change in scientific thinking as E=3Dmc<superscript>2</superscript>. As these types of life-altering building blocks get defined, new ways of thinking emerge. In the cognitive economy, powerful forms of computational intelligence will accelerate them. For example, the AlphaGo system&#x0027;s radically unexpected moves in its victories over Go world champion Lee Sedol hinted at how deep learning systems could offer other step-change departures from the forces, logic, and patterns we take as gospel.},

  abstract={Hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTSs) are used to deal with situations in which the decision makers (DMs) think of several possible linguistic values or richer expressions than a single term for an indicator, alternative, variable, etc. Compared with fuzzy linguistic approaches, they are more convenient and flexible to reflect the DMs' preferences in decision making. For further applications of HFLTSs to decision making, we develop a concept of hesitant fuzzy linguistic preference relations (HFLPRs) as a tool to collect and present the DMs' preferences. Due to the importance of the consistency measures using preference relations in decision making, we develop some consistency measures for HFLPRs to ensure that the DMs are being neither random nor illogical. A consistency index is defined to establish the consistency thresholds of HFLPRs to measure whether an HFLPR is of acceptable consistency. For HFLPRs with unacceptable consistency, we develop two optimization methods to improve the consistency until they are acceptable. Several illustrative examples are given to validate the consistency measures and the optimization methods.},

  abstract={In this paper, new learning methods tolerant to imprecision are introduced and applied to fuzzy modeling based on the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system. The fuzzy modeling has an intrinsic inconsistency. It may perform thinking tolerant to imprecision, but learning methods are zero-tolerant to imprecision. The proposed methods make it possible to exclude this intrinsic inconsistency of a fuzzy modeling, where zero-tolerance learning is used to obtain fuzzy model tolerant to imprecision. These new methods can be called /spl epsiv/-insensitive learning or /spl epsiv/ learning, where, in order to fit the fuzzy model to real data, the /spl epsiv/-insensitive loss function is used. This leads to a weighted or "fuzzified" version of Vapnik's support vector regression machine. This paper introduces two approaches to solving the /spl epsiv/-insensitive learning problem. The first approach leads to the quadratic programming problem with bound constraints and one linear equality constraint. The second approach leads to a problem of solving a system of linear inequalities. Two computationally efficient numerical methods for the /spl epsiv/-insensitive learning are proposed. The /spl epsiv/-insensitive learning leads to a model with the minimal Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, which results in an improved generalization ability of this model and its outliers robustness. Finally, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the validity of the introduced methods.},
