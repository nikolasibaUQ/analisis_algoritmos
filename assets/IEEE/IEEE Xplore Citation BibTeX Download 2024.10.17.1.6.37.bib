  abstract={Cloud is changing the way IT thinks and works, it's changing the way administrators do their job, the way businesses offer their services, how consultants create new offerings and solutions, and how management divide capital and operational expenses. Most of the administrators are reluctant to use cloud services because of the fear that the Cloud will make them obsolete. The rest of them, including the management have a dilemma whether to use it or not, and most important whether they are allowed to do it, based on local and global laws and regulatory compliances. This paper will deal with dilemmas administrators, consultants and management may encounter during the transition to the cloud solution, from the technical, through business, to the regulatory and legal perspective. It will give an overview on Croatian laws and rules created by Croatian regulatory bodies, which will help to solve this dilemma and make the transition to the cloud solution easier and smoother for most of the businesses that are having abovementioned dilemma.},

  abstract={With the development of Internet and computation technique, many areas begin to process their own area data more accurately. Especially, oil field area involves many disciplinary area data, such as physical geography disciplinary, geological disciplinary, reservoir engineering disciplinary and so on, data from simple character type to complex bulk data volume type. How to effectively manage these distributed data is always a hot potato for the oil field companies, recently, many oil companies begin to construct their own data center, however, only some topic data for research is stored in data center, it does not implement real uniform data management. Data grid technique is proposed for solving these issues, it regards data management issues as service management, and it solves data management issues puzzled people. According to these facts, a digital oil field framework based on data grid technique is proposed. We think this framework is able to solve oil field data management issues and provide all kinds of users with interested data.},

  abstract={In the last few decades, a silent revolution is taking place. The exponential growth in microelectronic processing power has been achieved by ever decreasing the size of integrated circuits. These circuits which integrate electrical, mechanical and sometimes optical devices, have evolved from silicon revolution. It replaced big complex, costly systems with small, affordable, high performance microsystems. Microsystems are expected to further enable silicon chips to sense, "think", act, and communicate. In essence, to become intlelligent machines. Structures of current microsystems are approaching fundamental limits and the next generation of devices might. show unexpected properties due to quantum effects and fluctuations. A new research field is developing in which we pursue understanding of basic physics associated with such quantum structures, explore their control1 ability, and propose new devices. In this talk, we will begin with a summary of engineering problem solving and proceed to discuss the impact of technology on the development of newly emerging discipline of soft computing and compulational intelligence. The relationship between technology and intelligent mechatronics will be pointed out.},

  abstract={Provision of reliable traffic data could cause a reduction of the traffic problem. In a previous paper, the authors developed the core of RIMAC, an information system that allows the introduction of new and reliable sources of information from camcorders, traffic lights or mobile phones. With these new data sources, RIMAC is able to provide many more realistic reports. This paper describes the development of the second part of the project: the interconnection of the core with a source of information: a camera network. In order to avoid congestion or loss of data packets, thinking of non-optical fiber networks, speed reports will be sent to the RIMAC core instead of unprocessed images. In situ, at each camera node, speed calculation is done using a C++ computer vision application and the OpenCV's Libraries over an SBC (Single Board Computer) Raspberry Pi2 with a CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) camera. The first testbed was done in a few streets of Lima, an emerging South American city where live about 10 million people. Lima is beginning a long-term transportation reform plan, activists are pushing for introducing the right paradigms of citizenship and appropriate technology, like RIMAC, into the plan.},

  abstract={Ubiquitous computing (UBICOMP) is a term used for human interaction with computers in virtually everything we do and almost everywhere we go. It is embedding computers in our daily lives to create an active and intelligent environment [1]. This is future phase of computers, which is beyond the desktop and notebook environment, where we are currently in and we are progressively heading deeper inside this new phase. In Ubiquitous Computing we mainly focus on computer being integral part of human such that we are unaware of their presence. Computer scientists are focusing hard on ways how the interaction between human and computer can be simplified. We can think of an era where we are surrounded with over hundreds of computers each doing a unique task irrespective of location and time and keeping human unaware. In this article we explore about the evolution of ubiquitous computing from its origin and history, its architecture, role of privacy and integration of privacy in system design, its Features and Technical Challenges. Ubiquitous computing is the third wave in computing, which has begun just now. Ubicomp is a field where we require considerable efforts to match up the current technological developments. According to the view of Computer Scientists and Engineers in future we will be having such a technological advancement in this field that will amaze the world.},

In modern days, humans are creating lots of new machine and that help out time, save energy. First human think about the idea about AI and then as a result it comes out as a machine language. Computer knowledge is very important for that. This research is based on machine language and artificial intelligence and their effects on business. Upgrading both of this process and checking their security are also essential. Unemployment is a side effect of this good work.

In order to analysis of accessibility, the spatial interaction model is known as a general model because it has been developed by entropy maximization principle for a long history. From observed data about traffic flow, our model can estimate traffic volume among inside and outside of target area by using observed traffic flow data. It can be regarded as a merged concept between the geographical advantage and accessibility of the spatial interaction model in unified way. The parameter estimation procedure for the proposed model is developed.},

  abstract={Since some decades ago, cybercrimes have not only increased but it is also becoming more complex. The attackers are using more sophisticated techniques for data breaching. As humans take more time to understand the patterns of cyber-attacks, traditional methods of cyber security were not as much relevant. Henceforth, in the late 1980s the concept of artificial intelligence combined with cyber security, came into existence. Due to the machine learning and deep learning concepts humans teach the machine to detect the threats. By taking the help of big data machine learn the different patterns of attacks. By the concepts of deep learning the machine is able to learn from experiences, it can remember the patterns of different attacks. Neural networks make it possible for a machine to think like humans. Now when a threat arises the artificial intelligence is able to detect and take an action against it. It is true that the artificial intelligence has totally changed the world of cyber security but now also there are some questions in the human mind. This paper includes the basics of Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, Deep learning, AI in cyber security and many more collected through the survey of different papers.},

  abstract={In recent years, with the continuous development of digitalization, all kinds of data on the Internet have increased rapidly, and knowledge graphs have emerged. Knowledge graphs have become one of the important means for us to manage and utilize knowledge. Knowledge reasoning is part of building a knowledge graph. There are many different methods of knowledge reasoning, which are mainly divided into traditional knowledge reasoning and knowledge reasoning over knowledge graph. The knowledge reasoning manner based on neural network has stronger thinking ability and generalization ability. The inference effect is better. The utilization rate of the relation, entity, attribute and text information in the knowledge base is higher. In this paper, the basic ideas of knowledge graph are introduced in detail. The basic principle of knowledge reasoning is expounded. In addition, from the three dimensions of semantics, structure and auxiliary storage. Three inference methods are introduced. Furthermore, the problems of neural network are summarized, and the challenges of knowledge reasoning are described. Finally, The development prospect of neural network and knowledge reasoning are prospected.},

Pursuing this point of view pays rich dividends. Important concepts like state space, next-state function, termination, fixed points, invariants, traces etc., can be mapped from dynamical systems to elements of algorithm design. Many of these concepts can be visualised through plots that trace the dynamic behaviour of the algorithm.},

  abstract={Recently, there have been several studies on potential application of the ENZ (plasmonic) metamaterials in dielectric waveguides and similar structures at optical frequencies. It was shown possible to tunnel the flow of EM energy trough a slab (or a rod) made out of an ENZ material, transversal dimension of which can be arbitrarily smaller than a wavelength. In addition, one could think of a complementary structure that comprises a dielectric slab embedded within an ENZ metamaterial. Such a structure (a simple air slab with a subwavelength thickness, embedded within an anisotropic ENZ metamaterial) is analyzed in this paper. Numerical results revealed behavior similar to the behavior of an ordinary dielectric waveguide, but with considerably longer guiding wavelength (for a fixed width of a core slab). Numerical results were verified by the measurements on the RF scaled replica of an ENZ waveguide, operating in 4 GHz frequency band.},

The fuzzy inference system is established to simulate the human thinking, which is used to design LTCC filter. Especially, when there are many the design parameters and the influence of the parameters on the filter is complex, this method can be effective in the design of LTCC filter. In order to verify the correctness of the proposed method, a LTCC filter is designed by using this method. The optimal results are compared with the measured results. It verifies the effectiveness and correctness of the fuzzy algorithm for the design of LTCC filters.},

  abstract={Current research and futuristic approaches including machine learning promise the wide and thorough use of measurement data in assembly processes for analysis and optimization. However, in current assembly lines measurement data is not available in every process, e.g. not in manual assembly processes. In addition, the integration and combination of data from different sources within the assembly line will require huge efforts during the next years. Therefore, a solely data based approach is not suitable for current optimization projects that usually have to react quickly to occurring challenges. Thus, the research project “MessMo - metrologically supported assembly” uses, benchmarks and combines approaches from machine learning and methodic thinking for modelling, cause-effect-identification and optimization. Three approaches for modelling are utilized, accompanied by one approach for data and process optimization.},

Finally, the method is evaluated by a case study of InSAR monitoring results at one region of Xi'an in 2007. The result shows that contour has been improved obviously after treated with filter and the method of robust filter make the effect more obvious.},

  abstract={Big Data Security and privacy are key concerns for cloud computing. At the initial stage, security was not considered for processing Big Data because of insufficient research and adequate security technology. Now researchers have to think new ways for cloud storage and Big Data security to overcome exiting security challenges of Big Data storage. For rapid Big Data processing, encryption is often considered as a big obstacle as clear data processing is much faster than encrypted data. But for cloud system, encrypted data processing is not a big deal because of massive processing power of cloud systems. So encryption will not be an obstacle and degrade the performance to process encrypted Big Data at cloud. There is a big challenge now to store and provide security in small chunk in cloud system and also key management. This paper provides novel approach for Big Data security over cloud namely Secured and High Performance Distributed Big Data Storage (SH-DBDS) model. Data will be split and uploaded for distributed cloud storage system. Single split data will be worthless until and unless joined with the other parts of the data. In this paper, an algorithm has been provided to split and join the data. Experimentation is performed with different data sets (10MB-1GB) at local system and AWS cloud and performance is measured. Evaluation is done considering the security and performance of Big Data.},

  abstract={In this Hybrid K-Means Clustering for Grouping research work, the k-means methodology is a well-known process for grouping things together. Most of the time, this algorithm sorts the objects into a set number of clusters, but in this case, the user gives the number k. At first, it picks cluster centres at random and measures how far apart k points are. This kind of cluster centre is called k centroids, and it will keep changing until there are no more changes. When making applications that use machine intelligence, a machine should be able to think like a person and make the right choices. In this case, it's not possible to get k-points from the user. So, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to search with heuristics to find the initial cluster centres. The goal of this research work is to look at how k-means clustering with GA can be used to optimise. The performance evaluation of hybrid k means method illustrates the precision and accuracy of the selected clustering methods. The result states that precision was 78.35% and its accuracy was 72.67% found while using the approach. The ROC curve analysis is performed with sensitivity and specificity data. The result states that the area under curve of the approach is 84.0%.},

  abstract={The neuronal content of an organism, the individual morphology of each neuron and the variability of these components constitute the atlas of the neurome. The description of such an atlas will be critical in determining the complex neural system of a given organism, eventually providing clues to how animals think and function. As the organisms under investigation scale from the worm to the human, the number of neurons scale from tens to millions. Image analysis is a key ingredient in tackling a neurome for complex organisms. Specifically, two major problems stand between the state of the art and successful automation. First, neurons must be segmented from microscopy, yielding a morphological description of each individual neuron. Second, these neurons must be matched to prototypes and classified by function. This report describes current progress on these two fronts, revealing encouraging progress as demonstrated on the fruit fly Drosophila.},

  abstract={Space-time big data, represented by space-space integration, combines GIS, remote sensing, tilt photography, BIM and Internet of things, and is an important driving force for the development of highway information. However, at present, China’s highway design code still adopts two-dimensional drawings as the design and delivery standards. That leads to the lack of the information management technology for large-scale highway construction based on space-time big data. In order to solve the above problems, this paper expounds the technical framework of spatio-temporal big data, which is composed of geographical modeling, geographical design, geographical monitoring and geographical control, and puts forward some key technologies such as geographical information, BIM and tilt photography, etc., the paper also introduces the experience and thinking of the application of road information technology based on BIM in the design and construction of G30 project, the advantages of applying BIM and GIS to the field of highway engineering design and construction in our country are revealed. Compared with the current highway design and construction management methods, the advantages of the proposed method are the whole process of collaborative work and the efficient control of the whole process. This laid a foundation for the further development of highway information technology and application by combining remote sensing, tilt photography and other advanced technologies.},

  abstract={It is a hot issue of current research that how to strengthen the land use management, so that resources and environmental capacity, land development costs and industrial construction and agricultural production would be spatial balanced to promote regional sustainable development in rapid urbanization and industrialization process. A Case Study in Langfang city of Hebei province was made. Based on equilibrium theory, the evaluation index system of land ecological and land development were made. According to the four principles of the unique highest ecological protection degree, low-benefit subject to high efficiency, land ecological protection would be considered under the higher conditions, land development would be considered under the general conditions, the two-dimensional correlation matrix of the land use ecological protection and development degree was built up in order to realize the land use guide regionalization. Then, in ArcGIS, 100 meters * 100 meters as a unit, land use development and ecological protection index were measured by grid computing and the land use guide regionalization was implemented through index rating-reassignment - grid computing - reclassification process in the study area. The study area was divided into four districts: key development areas, appropriate development areas, appropriate protective areas and key protective areas. Besides, different development strategies were provided for respective development areas. In key development areas, spots - axis development model was choused. In appropriate protective areas, intensive use pattern of development, which means protection of priority and appropriate development, is more reasonable. While key protective areas should adopt the ease with protected mode to strictly control the constructive land development for protecting the ecological services function. The study results show that: 1) the matrix of land use ecological protection-development degree is an effective method of land use guide classification. 2) the calculation results of the land use ecological protection and land use development degree directly affect the classification results. 3) the thinking and contents of the regionalization indices system can be extended.},

  abstract={Many senior citizens stay in a hospital, or they are moved into sheltered accommodation. When they live apart from their family, there is a risk of them suffering from serious disturbance in mental ability including delirium due to stress [1] [2]. Their family can visit hospital or sheltered accomodation and meet senior citizens so as to reduce their stress and prevent them from suffering serious disturbance. However they might not be able to do so due to epidemics. They can communicate with their family as in the case of life when they live in same house by making constant video calls instead of visit. However, they may feel uncomfortable with constant shooting. We feel a need of the system that they can communicate without feeling uncomfortable even if senior citizens live apart from their family. When we came to think of the place where the families lived in comfortably, the living room came to our mind. Family live freely in the living room, spending much of their time without a strong connection each other. But a person can start a conversation at any time by talking to another person, and the conversation will end naturally without clear termination signal. For this reason, we have proposed “Virtual living room system” [3] that had these feature and reproduced a real living room. We made an experimental system in order to verify the validity of the system and conducted experiments that we had subjects live while using it. In the experiment, we confirm the usefulness of the system. However, we also confirm two problems through the opinions of participants. One is the lack of presence. The system displays an icon on the screen that represents the the information of whether person that lives away from the user is in a certain room or not. The icon is not related to the user, so it may not have made the users feel that they live in the same place. The other is the difficulty of setting up for using the system. Setting up this system is not easy for people who are not very familiar with computer operation. The system will actually be used in a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the staff work in would have to set up the system and help the user use it. They may be unfamiliar with computer operation and probably cannot set up the system and use it by theirselves. In this paper, we propose an improved system based on photos that is created in view of the problem and the actual users.},

  abstract={The rapid diffusion of software systems into all aspects of our lives has raised new challenges for requirements engineers. These challenges call for an in-depth understanding of system usage scenarios and user capabilities, attitudes, emotions, barriers, and more. Current methods and tools, such as the Design Thinking methodology and the Empathy Map tool, have been proposed for supporting the multifaceted requirements elicitation process. However, using these methods and tools effectively is not simple, requiring not only competency but also motivation, high self-efficacy, and positive attitudes. These emotional attributes are strongly influenced by the work environment in which the requirements engineers operate.},
