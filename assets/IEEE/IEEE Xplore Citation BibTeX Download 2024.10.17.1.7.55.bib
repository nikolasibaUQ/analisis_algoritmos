  abstract={With the multiplication of cell phones, and their undeniably capable installed processors and capacity, huge assets progressively encompass clients. We have been exploring the idea of on-request framing of gatherings of adjacent cell phones group to perform computationally serious tasks as a support of nearby versatile clients, or what we call portable group registering. As gadgets can change in preparing force and some can leave a gathering out of the new gadgets participate, there is a requirement for calculations that can disseminate work in an adaptable way and still work with various courses of action of gadgets that can emerge in a specially appointed manner. In this paper, we first contend for the practicality of such utilization of group installed calculations utilizing hypothetical and writing about our tests on hotspot based closeness detecting. We at that point show a multi-layered work taking style calculation for conveying work effectively among cell phones and think about speedups achievable for various topologies of gadgets connected with hotspot, defending a topology-adaptable sharp approach. While our trials are with hotspot and cell phones, the approach is appropriate to systems of different installed gadgets with effective processors, organizing innovations, and capacity that will progressively encompass clients.},

  abstract={Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a promising technology that controls computers or machines using brain signals. With this technology, people with various disabilities, such as neural paralysis, and spinal cord injury can control electric devices or express their intention by thinking. However, previous BCI studies have a limitation that they can predict only one type of intention. To use the BCI system in daily life, the BCI user should be able to achieve various tasks such as moving, text typing, and arm movements. In this paper, we propose a multi-functional BCI method that can predict various intentions simultaneously. To classify multiple intentions, we proposed two prediction models using Neural Networks (NN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models. To evaluate the proposed BCI system, the classification accuracy of the model was measured and compared using steady state visually evoked potential (SSVEP), sensory motor rhythm (SMR), and both of them (Multiple Intention). The average prediction accuracies were 22.46% in NN, 55.86% in CNN. These results indicate that the proposed multi-functional BCI can predict multiple intentions. It also means that users of the proposed BCI system can control various electric devices simultaneously.},

  abstract={We present a new conception of process service which is the extension of workflow. The separation of process logic from business logic is the key for building such service in system layer. However, the separation idea is often hard to be implemented because of inherent coupling characteristics in business process applications. None of workflow systems, including flexible workflow systems, is very successful in that aspect. We have analyzed WFMC model and find that there exist several defects in it. The model lacks necessary criterion and some of the elements are so inexplicit that they're implemented excessively randomly in workflow systems. We think that it's the root of the separation problem. We design a new model for process service. Compared with WFMC model, both the composition and the structure are changed. Especially, we constitute a framework on the model to realize the separation idea really and truly.},

  abstract={Objective: To test the effect of the artificial intelligence video feedback system in the basketball shooting teaching in Colleges and universities. Methods: 24 male basketball players from XX University were randomly divided into experimental group (n=12) and control group (n=12). The experimental group and the control group were given shooting learning for 8 weeks. During each teaching period, the experimental group was intervened with 10-minute video feedback system, while the control group was not intervened. Results: After the experiment, the shooting percentage and the performance of action skill evaluation of the experimental group were significantly higher than those before the experiment (p=0. 032<0.05). After the experiment, the control group in the fixed-point shot and jump shot shooting percentage and action skill evaluation results were higher than before the experiment (p=0.158>0.05). After the experiment, the experimental group in the fixed-point shot and jump shot shooting percentage and action skill evaluation results were significantly higher than the control group (p=0. 026<0.05). Conclusion: The application of artificial intelligence video feedback system in college basketball shooting teaching is helpful to: Students can get the action points of shooting technique more richly and intuitively; Help students quickly establish the technical action model and spatial thinking concept of shooting; The correction and consolidation of shooting techniques are more personalized and timely.},

  abstract={The computation of relative Saliency in fused approximate images' local area is the key of obtaining efficient image fusion coefficients. According to the statistical characteristic of wavelet approximate coefficients in fused image, wavelet Generalized Gamma Distribution(G Γ D) model is built for capturing the distribution of approximate coefficients in local area. GΓD model's parameters are estimated by Immune Clone Selection(ICS) algorithm derived from Evolutionary Computation thinking. The estimated parameters are applied in a new fusion strategy for obtaining the final fusion coefficients. Results clearly demonstrate the superiority of this new approach when compared to the methods such as traditional contrast pyramid(CP) and wavelet fusion methods in terms of image information entropy(IE) values, average gradient(AG) values and standard difference(STD) values.},

  abstract={Transhipment is the process of moving goods from source to destination passing through several intermediate checkpoints. Tracking of a transhipment involves few issues that need to be addressed, like goods being a) damaged, b) lost c) delayed in delivery, d) delivered to wrong recipient, etc. All these issues are the major cause of dissatisfaction to the customers if no proper tracking system is available. In this case, Cognitive Agents (CAs) can be found helpful as they are capable of thinking and acting accordingly as a human brain. In this paper using CAs with Behaviour-Observation-Belief (BOB) model, the tracking of transhipment of goods is done. Its performance is good with respect to accuracy, successful transhipment rate and bandwidth consumption.},

  abstract={A microformat is a set of design principles for including semantic information within standard X/HTML markup. Individual microformat entities are distributed yet share a common semantics. Each microformat is a granule of structured information containing a set of attributes. These information granules can be produced, distributed, aggregated, and consumed without reliance on centralized services. We describe the impact on the gathering, distribution, and analysis of concepts within our visual communication research. In this paper we present solutions for managing lexical consistency when microformat-structured information granules are distributed and maintained independently and asynchronously. Lexical groups and hierarchies leverage the resulting inconsistencies, utilizing term aggregation across visual and linguistic features to dynamically compose lexicons and to perform lexical analysis. We think of this as creating semantic and orthographic 'projections' of the lexicon into different feature spaces. We show how to use this approach to construct situated lexicons which derive from shared context and social communities.},

  abstract={The emergence of cloud computing(CC), the three service levels of IaaS, PaaS and SaaS, and the cloud service delivery model of “cloud” + “end” have changed the development thinking of the entire IT industry. The education industry has also been influenced by new technologies and concepts, especially the core technologies of CC - “virtualization” and “distribution”, which make the education industry face the challenges in teaching and learning resources management and laboratory management. In particular, the core technologies of CC - “virtualization” and “distributed” - have given the education industry a revolutionary solution to the challenges faced in the management of teaching resources and laboratory management. In this paper, we design a simulation model of physical education(PE) teaching in CC based on Java. The results show that the Java-based CC PE teaching is more conducive to improving students' performance and thus physical and motor skills; stimulating students' learning needs and thus forming expectations for course learning; and being able to continuously improve students' performance. The results show that the Java-based cloud-based PE teaching is more conducive to improving students' performance and thus physical and motor skills; stimulating students' learning needs and thus forming expectations for the learning of the course; and continuously stimulating students' learning initiatives to achieve the purpose of improving academic interest indicators.},

  abstract={Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) which is neurological and developmental condition. ASD can be detected by observing distinct patterns in an individual's learning, behaviour, communication, decision making ability and social interactions. The ability to anticipate emotions can prove beneficial in various situations, particularly when dealing with individuals across the autism spectrum with varying degrees of severity. Decision- making encompasses not only intelligence and perception but also emotions. Emotion Detection is helpful in Bio Feedback Therapy for ASD. Positive emotions, for example mostly tend to facilitate forward-thinking and successful decision-making while negative emotions often contribute to poor well-being or depression. A transformer model, a type of neural network architecture, possesses the capability to automatically convert one form of input into another form of output. This work intends to investigate various signals that may be useful in identifying emotions for the purpose of predicting autism as well as transformer model-based algorithms that may be useful in determining the Autism Severity Grading. Similar methods are used now to assist those who are autistic. There is also discussion of medical applications using minimal parameters and methods.},

There are major benefits to the health field in understanding how the brain works, which might lead to the cures of many currently difficult or impossible to cure diseases.

In practical terms, the real has imposed itself in the last three years in which the pandemic by COVID-19 made us rethink the bases of our existence. Its relationship with image expressions, like indexicality, mimicry or visibility, seems obvious. However, the complexity of the image brought by digital technologies that capture, edit and/or construct in a participative way in realtime, implies that expressions like illusion, participation, simulation or creativity; become much more pertinent to the discussion of the image and the positioning of the subject. By dislocating/displacing reality, /replacing it, through the manipulative capacity offered by the technology that is essentially plasma through computer graphics and exponentiated in portable devices, the image lost one of the fundamental characteristics of its essence as testimony, gaining an interactive synaesthetic dimension and enhancing the creativity of the users/fruiters.},

Exploring the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in the place the user needs to travel thereby facilitating user perception on travel is becoming a mandate nowadays. Travel perception is also important for variety of day-to-day activities like transportation of goods and services, health related travel etc., This work aims to create comprehensive and efficient prediction models, facilitated by a convenient user interface to predict how risky or convenient it is for a user to travel in a time where COVID-19 is prevalent. The predictions made are based on the location they wish to travel using various Machine Learning models. The results are combined with the individual's health history to arrive at an optimized decision. The model is trained using a comorbidities dataset as well as a location- wise weather dataset, which allows us to make the prediction of whether travelling is dangerous for the user or not. The user interface is designed to show predictions for various districts. The trained model is tested using the data provided in social media and government websites provided for prediction},

  abstract={under the background of economic globalization and financial integration, the financial market has gradually become an important part of the current market system. Besides the stock market is an important part of the financial market. From a macro perspective, government regulatory departments and policy makers can monitor the stock market by using stock index prediction model, so as to adjust macroeconomic policies in time. From a micro perspective, individual investors and enterprise investors can use stock index prediction model to improve their ability of avoiding risks, so it is of practical significance to build a high-precision stock index prediction model. In this paper, the EMD (Empirical Mode Decomposition) method and SVR (Support Vector Regression) algorithm were combined to construct the EMD-SVR stock index prediction model, and the IEME (Improved Extreme Mirror Extension) method was proposed to suppress the end effect of EMD method to form the IEME-EMD-SVR model. Finally, through the empirical research on the transaction price data of Shenzhen Stock Exchange Component Index and the comparative study on EMD-SVR model and IEME-EMD-SVR model, it is proved that IEME-EMD-SVR model has higher prediction accuracy and lower time complexity. The proposed model has provided a powerful tool for stock index prediction and provided a new way of thinking for the application of time-frequency analysis in financial time series.},

We shall show a construal of MENACE : an early example of a simple machine (made with matchboxes) that learns to improve its own performance at playing noughts and crosses. Some experts in machine learning contrast the `big data' methods of training networks with the use of explanatory models. It is proving difficult, but desirable, to integrate these approaches. We'll suggest why Empirical Modelling might offer some useful insights into this problem.},

  abstract={The Chinese house market has been flourishing in the past three decades as an increasingly bigger population moves into cities. To keep the rise of house price within a proper range and acceptable to the public, the government has adopted various approaches to bring the price under control. After intermittent fluctuations, house purchasing has become a hot topic for both the media and the public. It is of great significance to study the change of house price considering all the related factors. Some scientists prefer machine learning. Machine learning is a subject which involves many subjects such as probability theory, statistics, approximation theory, convex analysis, and algorithm complexity theory. In this paper, we will discuss the details of the machine learning algorithms, three typical models (i.e., AdaBoost, Linear Regression and KNN) and their strengths and weaknesses. In the future, the growing complexity of all the factors that influence house price will cause more and more trouble for scientists pursuing more precise results. Also, based on its own specialty that computer is still not able to think like a man, machine learning cannot achieve 100% right, which often results in some silly outcomes.},

  abstract={Many companies have used the Scrum framework for system and product development. In the implementation of the scrum framework, we often encounter obstacles and challenges in the field, one of them is a sense of belonging to the team’s work itself. The scrum team should act on their own and already know what to do on each sprint. They are already committed to what they think can be accomplished and can be helped by feeling ownership of the work they do each sprint. If the Scrum team is committed to the work to be carried out, over time it will certainly foster a sense of ownership within the Scrum team itself, including satisfaction with the results they have achieved. The most important thing to a Scrum Team is to remember, that the team is to take ownership of themselves. They are responsible for their own accountability, If they are to be truly self-directed. A lot of research has been done to determine the maturity level of a scrum team with their respective methods such as the Scrum Maturity Model and Agile Maturity Model but not related to team ownership.},

  abstract={Fracturing sand control is a complex sand prevention method. There are so many influence factors which can not be modeled by the structuring models in both the decision and the operation process. Expert system for the optimization design of the fracturing sand control can simulate the thinking patterns of those experts, collect the computer knowledge and models in the field, apply the fuzzy mathematics to the project design, deal with the uncertain parameters using fuzzy set theory, and qualify such parameters to achieve analogy reasoning. Thus, an intelligent analysis system is established, which can carry out analogy analysis and decision making based on the cases in engineering database and experiences in knowledge base, modify the parameters related to fracturing sand control by comparing different operation parameters and analogy reasoning, select the reasonable operation parameters, provide the feasible operation project, perform evaluation on the project and forecast the final result. Such a system can eliminate the hidden troubles during the operation, improve the scientific value of the operation and ensure the operation quality.},
