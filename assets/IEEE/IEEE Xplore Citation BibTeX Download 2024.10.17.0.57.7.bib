  abstract={A STEAM-based approach to education is presented that encompasses science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), with the addition of “the Arts” as a means of reversing continuing declines in science, math, and reading scores in U.S. secondary schools and to better prepare future STEAM scholars and professionals. This is despite the significant emphasis U.S. schools have placed on STEM curricula for nearly the past 20 years. The 2014 New York State Department of Labor report states, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) has indicated that the United States needs at least one million more STEM workers than is currently available. The report also cites that 75 percent of students who graduate with a STEM-related degree do not take STEM jobs; however, the need for STEM careers is 2.5 times higher than other fields within New York State. A case study of Project Fibonacci® is presented whose approach is one of immersive learning that emphasizes math within a STEAM context, holding focused STEAM educational forums, and establishing centers of excellence in STEAM education. This may offer additional benefits beyond traditional STEM-only approaches. There is an upward trend towards STEAM-focused curricula driven by the decline in academic scores, which provides more challenges for our youth to compete in the global workforce; and recognizing that STEAM builds upon math as the interconnection between the science and art disciplines, thus expanding career opportunities and experience that ensure a well-rounded citizenry. We are rediscovering the need for balancing the cognitive and logical sides of the brain with the creative force to engender an agile, growth-driven nationwide community.},

  abstract={In 2021, the first year of Metaverse, Web3.0 ecosystems emerged as a result of the Internet's de-centralized evolution. In the Web3.0 space, there has been a very active advancement of the generative art non-fungible token, which is a special asset stored on a blockchain that allows creators to buy and sell assets and verify ownership. In other words, as it reconstructs the interpersonal relationship, the generative art non-fungible token must carry cultural values to be meaningful, and waiting to observe artificial intelligence generative art in the future requires a new mindset and posture. Design thinking is a design-based approach to solve today's complex problems. This study thus addresses the new Web3.0 ecosystem and introduces environmental sustain ability issues and computational thinking in the form of generative art to discuss the possibilities of future design thinking. By linking with social information, this study also creates an intersection with heterogeneous knowledge and stimulates a new thinking pattern that is different from previous ones. This project of design and research in the Metaverse virtual environment is still a novel topic. Reviewing past literature indicates that relevant papers are very scarce, and more resources are urgently needed for research in this field.},

Fully immersive Virtual Reality (VR) is increasingly used in an educational context where adoption and practical use is growing, facilitated by more powerful and affordable VR headsets. Teaching the fundamentals of mathematics and its applied use can be challenging. In this paper, we propose the use of SG, VR, and the Learning Mechanics-Game Mechanics (LM-GM) framework for SG game analysis in the design of a game. The goal is to develop mathematical thinking skills and increase student engagement and retention through the use of gamification in the creation of a highly engaging and pedagogically sound immersive learning experience.},

  abstract={The abnormal pause or rate reduction in breathing is known as the sleep-apnea hypopnea syndrome and affects the quality of sleep of an individual. A novel method for the detection of sleep apnea events (pause in breathing) from peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) signals obtained from wearable devices is discussed in this paper. The paper details an apnea detection algorithm of a very high resolution on a per-second basis for which a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network- which we termed SomnNET- is developed. This network exhibits an accuracy of 97.08% and outperforms several lower resolution state-of-the-art apnea detection methods. The feasibility of model pruning and binarization to reduce the computational complexity is explored. The pruned network with 80% sparsity exhibited an accuracy of 89.75%, and the binarized network exhibited an accuracy of 68.22%. The performance of the proposed networks is compared against several state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  title={Black Political Participation in the Volunteer State}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={643-648},
  abstract={There have been several explanations advanced to account for the unsteady levels of political participation among Blacks in recent years, but rather unfortunately, little research has been conducted into the role local issues may play. National personalities and elongated election seasons inundated with negative campaigning may have "turned-off" potential voters, but as the popular aphorism goes, "all politics are local," and thus local conditions should be interrogated to help understand voting and other forms of political participation. To this end, this study seeks to probe more deeply into this phenomenon by examining local political participation in the American states. For reasons we outline below, we specifically focus on local political participation in the state of Tennessee (TN) Utilizing data from the 2016 Congressional Cooperative Election Study (CCE), we ask what local-level factors most likely influence political participation among Blacks in TN? In order to parse through the large 2016 CCES dataset more efficiently, we employ software programming tools to address our primary questions using computational thinking and research methods. This technology-driven style of political thinking demonstrates the utility of adopting computing tools and data-driven approaches to identify and address areas of concern across government and civic society. One implication of this work is that it highlights the need for political actors to think more locally when crafting strategies for outreach and engagement towards historically disadvantaged race groups.},

  title={Computational Intelligence for Efficient Numerical Design of Structures with Uncertain Parameters}, 
  year={2015},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1824-1831},
  abstract={An important task in engineering is the numerical design of structures. The current state of technology is characterized by deterministic thinking and practices. Fact is that all available data and information are characterized by uncertainty. An adequate consideration is necessary. The contribution gives an overview about approaches and methods for the numerical structural design, which consider the uncertainty of the data (a priori and design parameters). As the basis of the uncertainty modeling, the definition of polymorphic uncertainty models is proposed, to take real-world scenarios into account. Polymorphic uncertainty models allow the incorporation of the uncertainty characteristics variability (randomness), imprecision and incompleteness simultaneously. The direct consideration of data uncertainty in design tasks is for the optimization and the solution of the inverse problem not possible, due to the missing of rules for comparing uncertain quantities. An efficient approach is the formulation of surrogate models, differing in the order of evaluation uncertainty and solving the optimization task. This contribution presents the well known passive ("wait-and-see") and active ("here-and-now") approach for numerical design tasks analyzed with optimization or solving the inverse problem. The advantages and disadvantages of each concept are pointed out and the applicability, especially in early stages of design is demonstrated. Furthermore, numerical structural analysis, assessments, replacement models and reduction methods with uncertain data are outlined, leading to an efficient numerical design and to practical engineering solutions. This contribution demonstrates algorithms and methods for the numerical design concepts under consideration of polymorphic uncertainty models, by applying different surrogate models. Surrogate models allow the application of an appropriate uncertainty model. Suitable approaches for increasing numerical efficiency are reduction methods and replacement models among others. Reduction methods include model reduction, reducing the number of function calls and the complexity (e.g., The dimensionality with sensitivities). Replacement models are, e.g., Physically motivated and analytical metamodels. Analytical metamodel can be distinguished into approximation and classification methods. Numerically efficient classification algorithms are, e.g., Support Vector Machines or Self-Organizing Maps. Efficient approximate metamodels are, e.g., Artificial Neural Networks, Radial Basis Function Networks, and Extreme Learning Machines. The applicability of approach are demonstrated by means of engineering examples.},

  abstract={In a world where algorithms are ubiquitous, the development of computational thinking competencies is becoming progressively important among students, technology professionals, and 21st-century citizens in general. Educational games as a means of promoting computational thinking skills have gained popularity in recent years. Offering efficient educational games that promote computational thinking competencies requires personalized learning paths through adaptive difficulty. The research presented herein is a first attempt to define a difficulty function for maze-based programming challenges using log data obtained from Kodetu, which is a block-based maze game. Specifically, we conducted three studies with 9- to 16-year-old students who were asked to solve sequences of maze-based programming challenges. Using log data from these studies, we investigated the maze characteristics and the coding limitations that affect performance in the challenges and calculated the performance obtained by the participants using a fuzzy rule-based system. The results showed that the turns in a maze, the number of total steps of a maze, and the blocks provided affect student performance. Using regression analysis, we defined a difficulty function for maze-based programming challenges that considers the weights of these factors and provides a first step towards the design of adaptive learning paths for computational thinking-related educational games.},

  abstract={The general principle of the operation of neural systems is considered, which makes clear the efficiency of information-computational structures consisting of neural-like elements. At the heart of the formulated principle lies the highly anticipated hypothesis of I.P. Pavlov that the "correctly organized" modifications of the connections between the elements and structures of the nervous system is the basis of "higher nervous activity of man" (in the terminology proposed by Pavlov). The possibility of a clear formulation of the principle, which is naturally called the Pavlov Principle (PP), arose only recently, as a result of the victorious procession of the family of computer training algorithms such as Deep Learning, which led to extremely efficient schemes for using "fine-grained" computing devices (GPU, etc.) solving cognitively complex problems. The article briefly outlines the line of development of ideas about the work of the nervous system, starting with the discovery by I.P. Pavlov of systemic conditioned reflexes, then through the neural and synaptic schemes of E. Konorsky and D. Hebb, the perceptron of F. Rosenblatt, the connectionist works of the 1980s, to modern schemes of deep learning. For the proper functioning of PP based neural networks essential is (initial) randomness of the interneuronal connections. A computational example of the solution of the model problem based on the "direct" application of the Pavlov Principle is given.},

  abstract={A description is given of a systolic Cooley-Tukey fast Fourier transform algorithm for Boolean n-cubes with a substantial amount of storage per cube node. In mapping a Cooley-Tukey type FFT to such a network, the main concerns are effective use of the high connectivity/bandwidth of the Boolean n-cube, the computational resources, the storage bandwidth, if there is a storage hierarchy, and the pipelines should the arithmetic units have such a feature. Another important consideration in a multiprocessor, distributed storage architecture is the allocation and access to coefficients, if they are precomputed. FFT algorithms are described that use both the storage bandwidth and the communication system optimally and require storage of P+nN coefficients for a transform on P>or=N data elements. A complex-to-complex FFT on 16 million points is predicted to require about 1.5 s on a Connection Machine model CM-2.<>},

  abstract={We live in a complex world where uncertainty is the only certainty. Today's compelling business problem is replaced tomorrow with a problem which was not even imagined yesterday. Data driven decision systems are used by managers in support of their strategic decisions and should be agile and flexibility to survive in our ever change world of complex decisions. The argument presented in this conceptual paper is that data vault modeling is inherently better equipped than dimensional modelling to handle the turbulations of our complex world. The paper investigates the underlying assumptions of dimensional modelling and data vault modelling in terms of requirements collection and the resulting data modelling techniques. It uses critical systems thinking as guiding philosophy to reflect on the benefits of understanding and modelling a variety of perspectives in a problem situation. Critical systems thinking also promotes equal opportunity and accountability. It is argued that both these aspirations can better be achieved by using dimensional modeling as alternative to dimensional modelling. We hope to promote the development of sustainable data driven decision systems which can stand the test of our turbulent times.},

  abstract={The processing of dynamical systems from everyday life requires the development of system thinking and the record of mathematical relations between variables, which is known as mathematical modelling. The dilemma that appears is how to develop the system thinking and particularly mathematical modelling in schools at earlier ages. In order to discuss dynamical systems, the basic knowledge of differential equations is necessary. Therefore, mathematical modelling appears to be applicable only to students. The article represents a possible processing of dynamical systems with graphic oriented computer programmes, e.g. Berkeley Madonna, Daynasys and Stella in primary schools. The programme packages enable the pupils to construct a given system by linking together different graphical objects for parameters, variables, and fluxes of variables. Some actual examples (liquid flow) of the dynamical systems which can be used in primary schools will be shown in the article. In advance the examples of the liquid flows are linked to simple mathematical models which illustrate the object movement influenced by forces. We lay a particular emphasis on a simple mathematical model for free-falling objects in the air since this topic has already been taught at physics in primary schools.},

  abstract={Nowadays employees are compelled in their workplaces to use different types of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). ICTs are frequently updated in routine work without necessarily having the means to use them effectively. This inefficiency often causes stress for both ICTs employees and users. This type of stress is generally known as Technostress and it is dealt with by professionals using strategies known under the name of Coping Strategies (CSs). When thinking about information systems we generally forget that people (ICTs users in our case) are one of its important components, which keep information systems' workflow properly working. Based on some anterior researches, this paper proposes a conceptual model to reduce Technostress starting from the triggering agents and ending with the removal or the reduction of Technostress. We conclude by obtaining the Job Satisfaction.},

  abstract={Six Sigma is an up and coming, new way of thinking that strives for as close to perfection as possible. A Six Sigma approach can be applied to numerous aspects of life from computer science to businesses, and in this paper, we will explore how implementing a Six Sigma approach to a business can affect it. One of the first things we will investigate is how Six Sigma in business varies from how it is used in other fields. Once we understand this, we can dive into the various niches that it can apply to businesses. Some of these things are how it will help reduce waste and increase profits for a business. Expanding on this, we will also consider how implementing a new business practice such as a Six Sigma model could affect employee morale. We anticipate that due to a better business environment that something like this could improve, however it will be expanded upon further later in this research paper. Additionally, the last thing we would like to investigate involving Six Sigma in business is how it can change the quality of that business's goods or services. In this paper we will continue to investigate and research the previously stated research topics regarding Six Sigma in business. We will find out whether it is an effective approach and will be using how it affects waste, productivity, morale, and quality, to make an assessment.},

  abstract={The importance of dialogue in questioning assumptions and bringing new options and perspectives to light is well established in various areas of decision-making; what potential does it hold to enrich students' critical thinking competencies in the context of ethics education? We examine student work in an ethics course for senior computer science and software engineering students. The course includes a series of exercises in critical ethical inquiry, implementing the iterative Ethical Cycle approach of van de Poel and Royakkers with reflection sessions where students exchange peer critiques. Through a qualitative analysis of two years of student work, we explore two questions: what kinds of critical issues do students acknowledge in peer dialogue, and how do students incorporate, or fail to incorporate, critical challenges into their work? We identify and categorize critical challenges that appear in student reflection statements, and we identify a number of patterns of critical engagement: ways in which student map the identifications of critical challenges to subsequent changes in later iterations. Our results indicate that dialogue with others is generally an enriching component of students' ethical inquiry, though not all students take advantage of it even when built into class exercises, and other students may adopt new ideas in a superficial way, failing to truly incorporate them into prior discussion. The results also suggest certain design changes of the ethical analysis exercises that can help students take greater advantage of insights from their peers: fostering greater interplay between peers through a single clearly identified topic; more defined scaffolding of peer discussions, prompting students to identify critical challenges from others; further scaffolding to remind students of the peer challenges raised earlier and ask them how (and whether) they wish to incorporate these new perspectives into their own work; and more discussion and modeling of how to truly incorporate new ideas in a robust way.},

  abstract={Educational institutions worldwide continue to improve their teaching and learning activities in almost all the facets of the profession. Upon the declaration of COVID 19 as a pandemic, learning activities were abruptly shifted from the in-person to virtual classroom activities. The transition required changes in the strategies and methods/styles of teaching. Despite the success in most of the activities, classroom interactions and assessments of students' work emerged as areas that deserve more attention. The objective of this study is to develop a pilot project aimed at maintaining acceptable and secured levels of interactions and assessments. The setting for this study includes virtual classroom interactions, peer level tutoring sessions, and formative assessments. To improve the interactions, efficacious assessment methods deploying incremental levels of thinking were used. This requires a third-party program for embedding questions on prerecorded lectures. The questions were then randomized and assigned to the subjects. The use of hierarchical randomization of multiple-choice questions for the short quizzes resulted in reduction of cheating. The performance of the students in the four sections of a calculus course used for this project improved by 17%. For complete eradication of cheating, the midterm was returned from online back to the traditional classrooms. Such move will include the final exam in mid-December.},

At the same time, the cost of interfaces connecting the different islands of automation can be prohibitively expensive and often is not cost-justified.

Because of this emphasis, attention shifts from the more significant business and operational cost problems to viewing diagnostic images on ever more expensive equipment. This paper develops some of the key problems to be addressed while borrowing ideas from the field of factory automation. Chief among these borrowed concepts are the ideas of "process", "process control", "bottlenecks" and "capacity". In order to demonstrate the kind of paradigm shift from islands of automation to process control, an example is given of a process control-oriented user interface for a diagnostic workstation. Perhaps the shopworn and discredited PACS acronym can be retrieved with a new orientation as a diagnostic "process automation and control system".},

  abstract={Recent researches reveal that various paradigms of intelligence, such as natural, artificial, machinable, and computational intelligence, can be unified at the logical and functional levels known as abstract intelligence. This paper introduces abstract intelligence as a form of driving force that transfers information into knowledge and behaviors. An architectural framework of abstract intelligence and the Generic Abstract Intelligence Mode (GAIM) are formally developed that provide a unified theory for explaining the mechanisms of advanced intelligence. In order to deal with the highly complex and abstract objects in abstract intelligence, denotational mathematics is introduced as a category of expressive mathematical structures for modeling and manipulating high-level mathematical entities beyond numbers and sets, such as abstract objects, complex relations, behavioral information, abstract concepts, knowledge, processes, and systems. Applications of denotational mathematics in abstract intelligence, cognitive informatics, and computational intelligence are elaborated.},

  abstract={Data mining approaches have proven to be successful in improving learners’ interaction with educational computer games. Despite the potential of predictive modelling in providing timely adaptive learning and gameplay experience, there is a lack of research on the early prediction of learners’ performance in educational games. In this research, we propose an early predictive modelling approach, called GameEPM, to estimate learners’ final scores in an educational game for promoting computational thinking. Specifically, the GameEPM approach models the sequence of learners’ actions and then uses a limited sequence of the actions to predict the final score of the game for each learner. The findings from our initial trials show that our approach can accurately and robustly estimate the learners’ performance at the early stages of the game. Using less than 50% of learners’ action sequences, the cross-validated deep learning model achieves a squared correlation higher than 0.8 with a relative error of less than 8%, outperforming a range of regression models like linear regression, random forest, neural networks, and support vector machines. An additional experiment showed that the validated deep learning model can also achieve high performance while tested on an independent game dataset, showing its applicability and robustness in real-world cases. Comparing the results with traditional machine learning methods revealed that, in the validation and application phases, up to 0.30 and 0.35 R2 gain is achieved in favor of the deep learning model, respectively. Finally, we found that while the lengths of action sequences influence the predictive power of the traditional machine learning methods, this effect is not substantial in the deep learning model.},

  abstract={Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have garnered significant interest in research on high-performance computing because their computation and communication capabilities have drastically improved in recent years due to advances in semiconductor integration technologies that rely on Moore's Law. These improvements reveal the possibility of implementing a concept to enable on-the-fly offloading computation at which CPUs/GPUs perform poorly to FPGAs while performing low-latency data movement. We think that this concept is key to improving the performance of heterogeneous supercomputers using accelerators such as the GPU. In this paper, we propose a GPU-FPGA-accelerated simulation based on the concept and show preliminary results of the proposed concept.},

  abstract={The growing concern about offshore chip manufacturing has created considerable interest in solutions that can ensure the integrity and security of chips. Among various solutions, split manufacturing has received a lot of attention due to its security guarantees. With the recent emergence of new heterogeneous manufacturing technologies, including chiplet-based systems, there is a new opportunity for revisiting the design considerations for split manufacturing to fully exploit the opportunities presented by chiplet-based systems and improve various metrics, such as security, performance, and overhead.This work improves the state-of-the-art in secure chip manufacturing by proposing a new split manufacturing scheme. The key idea is to exploit the capabilities provided by chiplet integration technology for designing a new hybrid split manufacturing scheme that includes both vertical and horizontal splitting. Unlike existing vertical-only split manufacturing mechanisms, that target obfuscation of interconnections by splitting the design at a specific metallization layer into two portions, the proposed hybrid method increases trust by exploiting the chiplet paradigm shift, specifically, breaking the design into sub-designs, each represented by chiplets (independently fabricated), and obfuscating interconnections among them. The proposed obfuscation mechanism targets systems that exploit the chiplet technology to obtain important performance advantages, thus any chiplet-related overhead is not due to obfuscation. We evaluate our method using several experiments and compare it with the state-of-the-art using standard metrics, including area, power, delay, wirelength, and trust. Compared to conventional split manufacturing, our hybrid method achieves up to 245× higher trust, while exhibiting negligible overhead.},

  abstract={This paper is centered on the implementation problems of learning activities for better education in a global and information society. Modern education must respect dynamic changes and preferences of business leading to competitive advantages; therefore, education seeks optimal ways to obtain the necessary knowledge and skills. Communication has an important place in education. The presented analysis is dedicated to Forum activity, with links to other learning activities for support communication (Database, Survey, or Wiki) from Moodle platform. The Forum activity is difficult for creation. Teacher must use on-line help or a specialist on the Moodle for optimal Forum creation via eighteen items. Other analyzed activities need smaller volume of work, but prompt implementation requires simplification using ideas of computational intelligence, and e-learning for knowledge society.},

  abstract={Distributed computing is becoming a prime need of the current era. The users are demanding more from the existing computing systems in terms of the computational power. The inherent nature of distributed computing enables the distribution of computationally expensive work across various available resources. Due to the distribution of the resources across multiple locations, there exists the challenge of discovering, synthesizing, and facilitating the resources to the client requests. In addition, the discovered resources must also comply with user requests to the diversely available resources along with their current information. In this paper, we aim to explore the resource discovery domain in the area of distributed computing and study the recent proposed schemes. We provide a survey of the distributed networking architecture and inherent discovery techniques. Furthermore, a critical analysis and comparison of the studied approaches is provided considering their networking architecture and the discovery technique.},
