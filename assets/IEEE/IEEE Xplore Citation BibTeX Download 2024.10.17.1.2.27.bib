  abstract={While feedforward deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been a great success in computer vision, it is important to note that the human visual cortex generally contains more feedback than feedforward connections. In this paper, we will briefly introduce the background of feedbacks in the human visual cortex, which motivates us to develop a computational feedback mechanism in deep neural networks. In addition to the feedforward inference in traditional neural networks, a feedback loop is introduced to infer the activation status of hidden layer neurons according to the "goal" of the network, e.g., high-level semantic labels. We analogize this mechanism as "Look and Think Twice." The feedback networks help better visualize and understand how deep neural networks work, and capture visual attention on expected objects, even in images with cluttered background and multiple objects. Experiments on ImageNet dataset demonstrate its effectiveness in solving tasks such as image classification and object localization.},

  abstract={Suicide is a critical issue in modern society. Early detection and prevention of suicide attempts should be addressed to save people's life. Current suicidal ideation detection (SID) methods include clinical methods based on the interaction between social workers or experts and the targeted individuals and machine learning techniques with feature engineering or deep learning for automatic detection based on online social contents. This article is the first survey that comprehensively introduces and discusses the methods from these categories. Domain-specific applications of SID are reviewed according to their data sources, i.e., questionnaires, electronic health records, suicide notes, and online user content. Several specific tasks and data sets are introduced and summarized to facilitate further research. Finally, we summarize the limitations of current work and provide an outlook of further research directions.},

  volume={8},

  pages={423-433},
  abstract={Publication productivity affects nearly every aspect of researchers’ scientific career, whereas it is difficult to be predicted due to diversity in researchers’ productivity patterns. This study proposed a model for the publication dynamics of researchers. The model is based on Lotka’s law as well as the relationship between the annual number of publications and time given a historical number of publications. The law and the statistical significance of the relationship are validated by applying them to the high-quality dblp data set. The model allows to predict the number of publications for research groups, and its effectiveness is tested on the data set by fine fittings on the distribution of the number of publications for researchers, the evolutionary trend of their publication productivity, and the probability of producing publications. Due to its nature of regression, the model has the potential to be extended to assess the confidence level of the prediction results and thus would be useful for other empirical research.},

  pages={1068-1082},
  abstract={Although followership has been widely studied in sociology and management, the problem of finding followers has not drawn attention in the field of artificial intelligence. We refer to the problem of finding followers of a given object as followers search. In sociology, followers are close to their leaders, and leaders are superior to their followers. In this article, aimed at finding followers of a given object, we formulate followers on the basis of both superiority and closeness. The former means that the given object should be superior to followers, and the latter means that followers should be close to the given object. We present a followers search algorithm to find the followers of the given object. Furthermore, we apply the ideas of followers to the market basket and recommender system datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the rationality of the discovered followers on the market basket dataset and the improved performance of the TrustPMF algorithm by adopting followership on recommender system datasets, which indicate a promising future for followers search.},

  pages={741-746},
  abstract={In this work, and inspired by the theory of bounded rationality and recursive reasoning, we propose two frameworks for modeling players’ behaviors and for choosing their policies in multi-agent dynamic stochastic game settings. In particular, we define multiple levels of rationality for each player, where at each level a player may reason about everyone else in two different ways; first, they may assume that the rest of the players have a cognitive level that is immediately lower than theirs, which is known as level-k thinking; second, they may assume that the rest of the players’ cognitive level follows a Poisson distribution, which is known as cognitive hierarchy. We construct algorithms for estimating the players’ policies at each level of rationality, both in a level-recursive as well as in a level-paralleled manner, and we study these algorithms’ convergence properties. Simulations on a grid world are provided to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed models.},

  abstract={Computer programming is often presented to students as an abstract discipline that looks aseptic and ultimately boring to many learners; learners find their first computing course uninspiring and programming hard and socially isolating. This causes a decline in the interest in computing among learners. Although there have been many attempts to make computing appealing, more interesting, easier and enjoyable, many educators are still using the classic methods in teaching and learning computer programming. The aim of this work is to call the attention of computing educators to an approach that uses 3D virtual environments to teaching programming. We introduce this approach through a tool that offers innovative methods for teaching wide spectrum of computing topics; Alice. Alice is an innovative programming environment that can be used to create stories by animating characters in a 3D world. Alice is written in Java and has an object-oriented flavor. The paper presents a review of research on using Alice in motivating teaching programming and problem solving, algorithmic thinking, software modeling, and game design and implementation. New trends of using Alice in teaching computing are also suggested.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Metaheuristics have been employed in solving several optimization and NP-hard problems owing to their ability to avoid local optima entrapment, flexibility and robustness, simplicity, and reasonable computational time. In this work, an empirical analysis is carried out on the application of metaheuristics in solving the protein structure prediction (PSP) problem. The PSP problem entails predicting a three-dimensional (3D) structure of proteins based on the amino acid sequences. This study employs the Ab Initio method, which relies on the thermodynamic properties of the proteins, such as the minimal free energy levels, bond angles, and torsional angles, in determining the protein structure. Five real protein sequences, namely 1CB3, 1BXL, 2H3S, 1TZ4, and 1CRN from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), and 11 metaheuristics including DE, GA, PSO, DSO, ACO, and HS were employed in the empirical analysis. Moreover, extensive Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to generate the results of the empirical analysis and these results were statistically tested using the Friedman test.},

Students are intellectually stimulated to make sense of people's behaviors and cognitive processes with multimodal sensing hardware and software. In doing so, they explore the fundamental challenges found at the intersection of computing, the human experience, and scientific interrogation. The placement of the human experience at the core of the research theme enables an environment that stimulates and cultivates an innovative undergraduate research model. We highlight outcomes from the first year and discuss three emerging practices that are central to our REU framework: (1) team-based collaborative training; (2) transdisciplinary integration; and (3) systematic prioritization of inclusiveness. We also describe how these practices are incorporated into our overall undergraduate research framework and touch upon lessons learned from feedback collected.},

  abstract={Proxy re-encryption (PRE) can guarantee the security of data sharing in the cloud making it important in ciphertext sharing in the cloud computing environment. Plenty of the current PRE algorithms based on the learning with errors (LWE) problem are constructed under the random oracle model or have problems such as long public parameter size, large ciphertext expansion rate, etc. We propose an identity-based PRE (IB-PRE) scheme using the LWE problem with short public parameters which can solve the mentioned challenges. Our scheme uses the blocking operation to decrease the public parameter size and a more useful trapdoor generation algorithm to reduce the trapdoor size. These two technologies improve the computational efficiency of the public key. We think that when we divide the identity id into 16 blocks, without much increase in computational overhead, the public key size can be reduced by 88.34%, and the scheme’s security level can remain unchanged. Our scheme achieves adaptive IND-ID-CPA security. It is unidirectional, collusion-resistant, and constructed under the standard model.},

In this work we present a visual analytic tool, Vox Civitas, designed to help journalists and media professionals extract news value from large-scale aggregations of social media content around broadcast events. We discuss the design of the tool, present the text analysis techniques used to enable the presentation, and provide details on the visual and interaction design.

  year={2011},
  volume={4},

  pages={35-46},
  abstract={This study presents a conceptual framework for providing intelligent supports through agent negotiation and fuzzy constraints to enhance the effectiveness of peer assessment. By using fuzzy constraints, it not only provides a flexible marking scheme to deal with the imprecision and uncertainty for the representation of assessment but also provides a computational framework to incorporate student's personal characteristics into the process for the reduction of assessment bias. Additionally, a fuzzy constraint-based negotiation mechanism is employed to coordinate the cognitive differences between students. Through iterative agent negotiation, students can reconcile the differences and reach an agreement on the assessment results. Thus, the proposed framework allows students to provide more detailed, informed, and less biased assessments for their peers' work. To demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed approach, a negotiation-based peer assessment system, NePAS, has been built and used in classroom. Experimental results suggested that students were more willing to accept the assessment results and able to acquire more useful information to reflect upon and revise their work. Instructors can also observe students' participation and performance to appropriately adjust instructional strategies.},

  abstract={Creativity and insight are distinctive attributes of human cognition, but their neural basis remains poorly understood due to the difficulty of experimental study. As such, computational modeling can play an important role in understanding these phenomena. Some researchers have proposed that creative individuals have a “deeper” organization of knowledge, allowing them to connect remote associates and form novel ideas. It is reasonable to assume that the depth and richness of semantic organization in individual minds is related to the connectivity of neural networks involved in semantic representation. In this paper, we use a simple and plausible neurodynamical model of semantic networks to study how the connectivity structure of these networks relates to the richness of the semantic constructs, or ideas, they can generate. This work is motivated, in part, by research showing that experimentally obtained semantic networks have a specific connectivity pattern that is both small-world and scale-free. We show that neural semantic networks reflecting this structure have richer semantic dynamics than those with other connectivity structures. Though simple, this model may provide insight into the important issue of how the physical structure of the brain determines one of the most profound features of the human mind - its capacity for creative thought.},

  abstract={In this paper, we propose a computational framework for automated story-based scenario generation. Under this framework, a regular grammar is developed to model various causal relationships inside a given story world. The grammar is then evolved using evolutionary computation techniques to generate novel story plots, i.e. story-based scenarios. To evaluate these newly generated scenarios, a human-in-the-loop model is used. An experimental study was carried out, in which the proposed framework was used to create novel plots based on the famous Little Red Riding Hood fairy tale. The experimental study demonstrated that evolutionary computation can potentially contribute significantly to story generations. Some challenges were identified including the difficulty to quantify such subjective measures as plot interestingness and creativity.},

  abstract={This paper illustrates a 10-year research endeavor on collective learning, a paradigm for tackling tragedy of the commons problems in socio-technical systems using human-centered distributed intelligence. In contrast to mainstream centralized artificial intelligence (AI) allowing algorithmic discrimination and manipulative nudging, the decentralized approach of collective learning is by-design participatory and value-sensitive: it aligns with privacy, autonomy, fairness and democratic values. Engineering such values in a socio-technical system results in computational constraints that turn collective decision-making into complex combinatorial NP-hard problems. These are the problems that collective learning and the EPOS research project tackles. Collective learning finds striking applicability in energy, traffic, supply-chain and the self-management of sharing economies. This grand applicability and the social impact are demonstrated in this paper along with a future perspective of the collective learning paradigm.},

  abstract={This article proposes a procedural content generator which evolves Minecraft buildings according to an open-ended and intrinsic definition of novelty. To realize this goal, we evaluate individuals’ novelty in the latent space using a 3-D autoencoder (AE), and alternate between phases of exploration and transformation. During exploration the system evolves multiple populations of CPPNs through CPPN-NEAT and constrained novelty search in the latent space (defined by the current AE). We apply a set of repair and constraint functions to ensure candidates adhere to basic structural rules during evolution. During transformation, we reshape the boundaries of the latent space to identify new interesting areas of the solution space by retraining the AE with novel content. In this study, we evaluate five different approaches for training the AE during transformation and its impact on populations’ quality and diversity during evolution. Our results show that by retraining the AE we can achieve better open-ended complexity compared to a static model, which is further improved when retraining using larger datasets of individuals with diverse complexities.},

  abstract={The development of analytical skills is a central goal of the Next Generation Science Standards and foundational to subject mastery in STEM fields. Yet, significant barriers exist to students gaining such skills. Here we describe a new “gentle-slope” cyberlearning strategy that gradually introduces students to the authoring of scientific simulations via a Web-based modding approach called CyberMOD. Modding involves adding agents with predefined functionality to a simulation world to produce a unique combination whose behavior can then be visualized by running the simulation. This permits low barrier experimentation on the modded simulation, which is hoped to help students gain a deeper understanding of scientific phenomena that is the focus of the activity. Our research questions are: i) does this approach encourage students' interest in computational science and ii) does it enhance their analytical abilities, and iii) does it foster a deeper understanding of the processes modded? Here we take an in-depth look at what was created for the CyberMOD infrastructure and analyze the results of initial in-class studies as to the effectiveness of this strategy. The results support the premise that teachers can easily integrate CyberMOD into their in-class activities, that CyberMOD activities encourage creative student learning, and that the CyberMOD approach facilitates student understanding.},

  abstract={We previously measured human performance on a complex problem-solving task that involves finding which ball in a set is lighter or heavier than the others with a limited number of weightings. None of the participants found a correct solution within 30 minutes without help of demonstrations or instructions. In this paper, we model human performance on this task using a biologically plausible computational model based on reinforcement learning. We use a SARSA-based Softmax learning algorithm where the reward function is learned using cascade-correlation neural networks. First, we find that the task can be learned by reinforcement alone with substantial training. Second, we study the number of alternative actions available to Softmax and find that 5 works well for this problem which is compatible with estimates of human working memory size. Third, we find that simulations are less accurate than humans given equivalent amount of training We suggest that humans use means-ends analysis to self-generate rewards in non-terminal states. Implementing such self-generated rewards might improve model accuracy. Finally, we pretrain models to prefer simple actions, like humans. We partially capture a simplicity bias, and find that it had little impact on accuracy.},

  abstract={High-end manufacturing systems are cyber-physical systems, where productivity depends on the close cooperation of mechanical (physical) and scheduling (cyber) aspects. Mechanical and control constraints impose minimal and maximal time differences between events in the product flow. Sequence-dependent constraints are used by a scheduler to optimize system productivity while satisfying operational requirements. The numerous constraints in a schedule are typically related to a relatively small set of parameters, such as speeds, lengths, or settling times. We contribute a parametric critical path algorithm that identifies bottlenecks in terms of the feasible parameter combinations. This algorithm allows analysis of schedules to identify bottlenecks in terms of the underlying cause of constraints. We also contribute a way to find Pareto-optimal cost-performance tradeoffs and their associated parameter combinations. These results are used to quantify the impact of relaxing constraints that hinder system productivity.},
