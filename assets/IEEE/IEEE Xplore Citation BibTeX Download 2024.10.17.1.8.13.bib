  abstract={Student creation of an interactive, science murder mystery game can result in accurate and coherent writing that describes scientific facts and principles. The activity capitalizes on various forms of learner motivation and on the benefits of interactive multimedia games. In addition, it requires students to think out a scenario and many permutations, provides exercises in logic and linking, demands the analysis of motives, and necessitates the construction of a narrative. That narrative stimulates students' powers of invention regarding causes, effects, conclusions, and solutions. The game assignment offers students the opportunity to use presentation software and to assemble a lively, colorful project.},

  pages={270-274},
  abstract={Proper Pronunciation is essential for a successful career. In the present era, recruiters do not want mug pots or rote learners i.e one that scores well in the technical or the core area. The need of the hour demands a holistic personality which must include good communication skills, critical thinking, managerial skills & logical reasoning. In the present study, the researchers have studied the mother tongue influence (MTI) in the English language spoken by the regional speakers of the Kumaun region. In the present study, the researchers have observed that the students of Uttarakhand have high MTI (Mother Tongue Influence) which is noticeable in their communication. They face difficulty in articulation of certain consonant sounds like sh (ꭍ), v, w, etc. Words like sheep /ꭍi:p/ are mispronounced as seep /si:p/, career/kₔriₔ/ as carrier /kᵆriₔ/ (Kay-rier). Due to poor pronunciation, they face challenges not only in the recruitment process but also in survival in Multi-National Companies where the American / British accent is widely used. The researchers conducted a diagnostic test to identify the extent and frequency of flaws in the articulation of words. It was observed that the performance of the regional learners was poor and required improvement. They implemented a Pre-Defined Algorithm model for improving the performance of the regional students. It was followed by a post-implementation test which was conducted through the proposed model. The proposed model has a better outcome concerning reducing the MTI in general pronunciation of the English Language among Kumauoni speakers of Uttarakhand.},

  abstract={This unprecedented time of the COVID-19 outbreak challenged the status-quo whether it is on business operation, political leadership, scientific capability, engineering implementation, data analysis, and strategic thinking, in terms of resiliency, agility, and innovativeness. Due to some identified constraints, while addressing the issue of global health, human ingenuity has proven again that in times of crisis, it is our best asset. Constraints like limited testing capacity and lack of real-time information regarding the spread of the virus, are the highest priority in the mitigation process, aside from the development of vaccines and the pushing through of vaccination programs. Using the available Chest X-Ray Images dataset and an AI-Computer Vision Technique called Convolutional Neural Network, features of the images were extracted and classified as COVID-19 positive or not. This paper proposes the usage of the 18-layer Residual Neural Network (ResNet-18) as an architecture instead of other ResNet with a higher number of layers. The researcher achieves the highest validation accuracy of 99.26%. Moving forward, using this lower number of layers in training a model classifier, resolves the issue of device constraints such as storage capacity and computing resources while still assuring highly accurate outputs.},

  abstract={In the modern information age, computers, multimedia and various technologies influence people's learning to a very large degree. College English teaching is no exception. “College English Curriculum Requirements” issued by Ministry of Education emphasize the importance of applying modern information technology into college English teaching, changing the traditional teaching system and constructing the multimedia- and network-based teaching model. However, the mere application of these information technologies is far from enough. Some problems have already appeared. So it is very necessary to take some guiding theories into consideration. Embodied philosophy puts special stress on the spirit of “people first”, which brings important inspiration for college English teaching. Starting from the perspective of embodied philosophy, the paper explores the essence of English teaching. That is “interactive experience”, which can be divided into three parts: with what to experience, what to experience first and how to experience. It hopes to activate teachers' and students' thinking and experience, in order to make computer-assisted college English teaching more practical and effective.},

  year={2019},

  pages={133-137},
  abstract={Queuing network techniques are effective for evaluating the performance of computer systems. We discuss a queuing network technique for computer systems in finite input source. The finite number of terminals exist in the network and a job in the network moves to the server that includes CPU, I/O equipment and memory after think-time at the terminal. When the job arrives at the server, it acquires a part of memory and executes CPU and I/O processing in the server. After the job completes CPU and I/O processing, it releases the memory and goes back to its original terminal. However, when the computer system has the memory resource, the queuing network model has no product form solution and cannot be calculated the exact solutions. We proposed here an approximation queuing network technique for calculating the performance measures of computer systems with finite input source on which multiple types of jobs exist. This technique involves dividing the queuing network into two levels; one is "inner level" in which a job executes CPU and I/O processing, and the other is "outer level" that includes terminals and communication lines. By dividing the network into two levels, we can prevent the number of states of the network from increasing and approximately calculate the performance measures of the network. We evaluated the proposed approximation technique by using numerical experiments and clarified the characteristics of the system response time and the mean number of jobs in the inner level.},

  abstract={With the increasing number of Internet applications and frequent network interactions, the resources in the Internet show explosive growth. Under the impact of this wave, methods based on large-scale data, such as deep learning, have been put forward, and scholars have begun to think about many classical tasks from a new perspective. The LDA model is used to mine the topic information in the texts in parallel corpora, and the polynomial distribution of thesaurus is used to represent the topic, so as to judge the proportion of each document topic in the document collection. The specific words are obtained according to the polynomial distribution of the corresponding thesaurus of the topic by probability sampling. The monolingual corpus of the target language is processed by maximum likelihood estimation method, and the parallel corpus is taken as the training target. The monolingual corpus of the target language is estimated by importance sampling and full probability formula, and a machine English translation model is established. The estimated expected value is obtained by beam search method, so that English sentence translation can be realized. When disambiguating 2000 groups of random phrases, the correct rate of word sense disambiguation was 79.9%, and the correct rate of structure disambiguation was 85.7%, which was 8.6% and 3.9% higher than the original system respectively.},

  abstract={Neural networks (NN) and machine learning (ML) techniques are gradually replacing true critical thinking. These methods surpass logical and quantitative approaches because they can handle massive boundaries in massive amounts of data and dynamic behavior over time. This article lays the groundwork for adaptive traffic control by proposing ML and DL calculations for crossing point traffic flow prediction. Adaptable traffic control can be accomplished by adjusting traffic light timing based on expected flow or by controlling traffic lights partially. That is why traffic flow prediction is the only focus here. The suggested ML and DL models are created, approved, and tested using two publicly available datasets. The first one gives a total of all cars analyzed by various sensors over a 56-day period, including clocks placed at six different crossroads. The ML and DL models used in this study were developed using four out of the six crossings. Subsequently, Multi-facet Perceptron Brain Organizations (MLP-NN) dealt with Irregular Backwoods, Direct Relapse, and Stochastic Inclination; MLP-NN required less preparation time but produced better results (R-Squared and EV score of 1.93) than Intermittent Brain Organizations (RNNs), which produced excellent measurement results but required more time overall. All ML and DL computations have excellent execution results, which makes them a good fit for intelligent traffic light management.},

  abstract={The author discusses the following questions about the IT market: Why is the commercial IT market organized unlike other markets? That is more challenging to answer than you would think. The IT market seems to change more quickly than other industries, and it seems to use frontier technologies more often. Neither trait is unique to IT, however, financial markets change quickly. Biotech uses frontier technology. Why does the presence and combination of quick change and frontier technology seem so special to the organization of IT markets? Here is a related puzzle. Over the last five decades, many parts of computing and networking have become compartmentalized into submarkets. Specialists inhabit each category and sometimes work with specialists in other categories, and sometimes not. Sometimes a single firm works in many of those submarkets, and sometimes many independent entrepreneurs do. While compartmentalization itself is not unique to IT - the automobile supply chain possess similar features, for example - the IT market witnesses frequent rearrangement of those categories, and the leading firms therein. Sometimes it is orderly and sometimes not. How did it get to be that way? The combination of technical interdependence and technical improvement in fundamental components results in frequent restructuring and mismatches. Difficult to manage, and always entertaining to watch, no other market behaves this way. Two decades ago all the energy went into adjudicating potential abuses of leadership at Microsoft and Intel. Two decades earlier it was IBM. These days the focus stares at Alphabet/Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft. That kind of rapid turnover in leadership happens in no other market.},

Its basic idea is to use the created model to explain the changes of dependent variables with the changes of one or more independent variables, and find out the relationship between independent variables and the dependent variables through then testing the model. Besides this, the Python is adopted for the systematic implementations. Python is a pure object-oriented language that supports all object-oriented mechanisms, which makes it applicable to large-scale software project development. Using this tool, the designed model is validated through the further simulation. Compared with the other methods, our design model cam evaluate better.},

  abstract={To explore the application effect, problems and countermeasures of the hybrid curriculum based on MOOC+ SPOCs in `Medical Data Processing and Its Implementation in MATLAB'. In the first round of the research, 59 medical students (from the 2018 class), who participated in the course, were divided into the experimental group and the control group. The LBL teaching method and the MOOC-based hybrid curriculum teaching methods were adopted, respectively. The effectiveness of the mixed method online and offline teaching mode was measured by a satisfaction survey and by comparing the examination results of the experimental group and the control group. Then, a second round of research was carried out. Asynchronous SPOCs were built on the basis of MOOC, and this kind of hybrid curriculum teaching was adopted. The online learning behaviors of 59 medical students of 2019, who participated in the course, were also analyzed. The average score of the experimental group (84.52±5.792) was higher than that of the control group (80.08±7.815). The results of the questionnaire showed that 72.6% of the students in the experimental group were willing to accept mixed curriculum teaching based on MOOC. The results of the second round of research show that there is a positive correlation between SOPCs online course scores and final scores, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.407 (P=0.001). The final scores of the course were generally over 70 points, and there was no linear correlation between the duration of watching learning videos and scores. The hybrid curriculum teaching based on MOOC+SPOCs can improve students' computing thinking ability and the teaching effect has been proved to be effective. Students have a high degree of satisfaction with this teaching mode. However, there were still some problems need to besolved in the future.},

  abstract={Nowadays in several criminal cases the progress makes us to think whether justice persists. In existing system, many news, and articles state that the victim data is manipulated, and records are changed by the officials. To address this issue, this paper proposes a secure system rendering justice with transparency which makes the court decision making easy. In the proposed Justice Secure Model, the victim voice data and records are prevented from data tampering using security policies. The criminal voice data are transformed into text using Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The voice data and records are secured by encrypting using Secured Hash Algorithm (SHA 256). To validate the access request, each victim records are embedded with private key. These private keys are securely transmitted by encrypting using modified AES algorithm. The above steps would avoid the internal data tampering and manipulating the victim case data. To address the external intrusion, our proposed methodology detects and prevent SQL injection attacks. Finally, to provide security of data at the server level, we have integrated multiple cloud storage system. The proposed system provide security at the application and server levels, thus making the unauthorized data access, intrusion, and data manipulation impossible.},

To increase the value of creative thinking, ideas have to be transformed into wealth production through generation, promotion, and distribution of appreciated products and/or services in a timely and competitive way. To achieve these goals, philosophies of institutions and (virtual) organizations need to be nurtured to promote collective creativity and transformation of ideas into wealth production. The main objectives of the study are to explore and identify design principles for virtual innovation communities and to model innovation as an evolutionary process. A simulation study is conducted to systemically study and generate hypotheses regarding governance mechanisms that improve innovation output. Findings suggest that decentralized coordination schemes such as emergent selection that are observed in utility communities along with moderate degrees of assertiveness and cooperation for conflict management result in higher incidence of innovation.},

  abstract={This article describes how quantum systems can be used to replicate complex physical occurrences, with emphasis on the use of new quantum algorithms and special data sets. First, let's talk about how quantum computers can handle big and complex data sets that are too hard for classical computers. The focus here is on the use of quantum computing methods. The main focus of our school assignment is on developing and executing quantum algorithms specifically designed to analyze and evaluate these datasets. These quantum algorithm allows us to model a complex system. Explain the basic of tool that can be used to quantum material properties. Instructions: Change the word ‘formulas’ into another Word and rephrase the sentence accordingly. The study proposes using quantum algorithms to handle large data collections. We explain how to transform classical data to quantum representation for clearer comprehension. Also illustrated is how this encoding may yield simulated outcomes. This approach ensures precise and reliable simulations. Unlike ordinary data storage and correction, quantum computing presents various problem-solving obstacles. To remove these challenges, the simulation is made painstakingly precise and dependable. Case studies may show how quantum systems can simulate complicated situations like astronomical object motions and subatomic particle activity under harsh conditions. These case studies show that quantum simulation can address issues traditional approaches can't. Our findings might affect future study, and quantum computing could transform our knowledge of complex physical events. We also discuss quantum computing and coding's pros and cons, encouraging creative thinking in this fascinating topic.},

  abstract={This research deals with the analysis and detection of current mental state including feelings, emotions and mental processes from body language signs, such as analysis of personality traits, psychological states, mental health monitoring, human-computer interaction and lie detection. In this study, we discovered this new approach to classify a person's current mental state through convolutional neural networks (CNN) based on the analysis of eye, mouth and hand positions. We use extensive data to train and evaluate our model, which includes video recordings and images that record various human activities and emotions. Pre-processing techniques including normalization and scaling are used to improve model reliability. We use a CNN architecture that is optimized for feature extraction from facial and hand movements and uses both spatial and temporal information from the input data. By extracting the main features of the eyes, mouth and hand positions and movements, we try to capture subtle clues that indicate different emotional states such as happiness, sadness etc., as well as cognitive processes such as thinking, imagining and creating. Experimental results show promising classification accuracy for detecting different mental states, with better performance than basic methods. Our approach provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between body language and mental states, contributing to the understanding of human behaviour. The proposed method has significant potential for real-world applications, including Psychological and behaviour analysis, mental health assessment, personal user interfaces etc. This proposed model is simply an artificial intelligence based psychologist.},

  abstract={It is difficult to use the traditional image segmentation method to segment the complex object whose boundary is blurred from the background. The active contour model, based on level set, is widely used in recent years and selected to segment this type of object in this paper. To increase the speed of segmentation, the fast active contour model without need to solve partial differential equation is used in this paper. This paper proposes a new way of thinking about designing the data-dependent speed function in the fast active model and gives the corresponding general speed function. The probability estimate theory and the conventional CV model are introduced into the data-dependent speed function, and then this paper proposes two novel fast models which can be called histogram-based fast model and CV-based fast model. The two models are studied both theoretically and experimentally. Finally a conclusion can be drawn that the histogram-based fast model is applied to segment the complex object from the background.},
