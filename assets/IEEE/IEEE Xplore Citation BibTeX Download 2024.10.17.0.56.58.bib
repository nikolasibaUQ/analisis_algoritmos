  abstract={This paper presents an innovative C3 (C-cube) Model-Map for teaching entrepreneurship and shares the experience of using this C3 Model-Map in a freshman seminar subject for computing students. Comprising three core elements: Customer, Concept and Company (C3), it can be used to shape a business model (e.g., for technology startups). In other words, students can use a concise and systematic model to frame their business ideas. This seeks to foster both analytical thinking and creative thinking. The teaching methodology and some evaluation results are also presented in this paper.},

  abstract={Through the introduction of Problem Based Learning (PBL) teaching method in the teaching session of engineering graphics courses, the path of implementation of PBL teaching method integrated with computer 3-D modeling in engineering graphics courses is discussed. The practice applications show that this teaching mode can help students master the knowledge points of engineering graphics courses, help teachers change the traditional teaching style, improve the teaching quality of engineering graphics courses, help students develop spatial image thinking ability and stimulate learning interest and innovative thinking. Compared with traditional classroom teaching, the teaching methods and teaching models studied in this article have obvious advantages in the implementation of such courses. They are also an important direction for the teaching reform of computer-aided engineering graphics courses in the future. Construction and development have good reference significance.},

  abstract={In this paper we propose a soft computing-based solution to assess multivariate prediction ability in legal decision-making process. The proposed method is capable of incorporating prior knowledge. The main goal is, automatizing legal decision making, which is complex, complicated and often characterized by broad vigilance. The aim is helping legal practitioners to be able to focus not only on the decision itself, rather the correlations between them and combining of their variations as well. This way a "hybrid" thinking would be performed. The system will be able to "think through" a great number of possible variations of decisions and their combinations synchronized with the speed of the human mind.},

  abstract={An important question is how to determine if a person is exhibiting suicidal tendencies in behavior, speech, or writing. This paper demonstrates a method of analyzing written material to determine whether or not a person is suicidal. The method involves an analysis of word frequencies that are used in a fuzzy cognitive map. The fuzzy cognitive map determines if there are suicidal tendencies. The method could have substantial potential in suicide prevention as well as in other forms of sociological behavior studies that also might exhibit their own identifying patterns.},

  pages={77-84},
  abstract={It has been observed that many networks arising in practice have skewed node degree distributions. Scale-free networks are one well-known class of such networks. Achieving efficient parallel simulation of scale-free networks is challenging because large-degree nodes can create bottlenecks that limit performance. To help address this problem we describe an approach called link partitioning where each network link is mapped to a logical process (LP) in contrast to the conventional approach of mapping each network node to an LP. Link partitioning is discussed in the context of packet-level simulations of telecommunication networks. The parallelism of link partitioning relative to node partitioning is examined in terms of an idealized execution using the well-known YAWNS synchronization algorithm. Further, a critical path analysis suggests that there is much more parallelism available in these simulations than can be exploited using the YAWNS algorithm.},

  abstract={Puzzles have long history and have been developed by many people. Nowadays computers are contributing very much to the evolution of puzzles. First computers were used to make arithmetical puzzles, like 'arithmetical restoration' or 'crypt-arithmetic,' then to make mechanical puzzles, like 'burr puzzles' or 'polyomino puzzles' and to make pencil and paper puzzles like 'sudoku.' So now puzzle creators of all genres use computers and they can make more beautiful puzzles with computers than before. Computers changed not only puzzle creators, but also puzzle solvers. Now many puzzle solvers are also computer programmers, and they enjoy puzzles by finding the way of solving puzzles by computers. Of course humans and computers are different in the way of thinking, so computer-solving isn't usually the intention of puzzle creators. But some puzzles are especially for computer programmers and we can say such are new tendency in the puzzle world.},

  abstract={The difficulty of grid-enabled application development is one of the obstacles to employ grid as infrastructure of scientific computing. Although there are many projects, especially grid workflow projects, trying to make grid-enabled application development easier and quicker, the process-based application description model adopted by most of the grid-enabled applications still bothers scientists who are usually beginner in programming. In this paper, a data dependency based application description model is proposed, which describes a grid-enabled application via dependency among data items in the application, and much close to the thinking pattern of scientists. Based on this model, a scientific computing oriented grid application description language (SCO-GADL) is proposed, and an engine for supporting its execution is designed and implemented. The extensible plug-in architecture adopted by SCO-GADL and its engine makes them support different grid and non-grid platforms easily. At last, a test shows that grid-enabled scientific applications can be developed easily in SCO-GADL, and executes correctly on the application engine.},

Then we present the M2M (macro to micro) data structure which maintains a finite set of n points in the plane under insertion and deletion of points in amortized O(1) time per operation and O(n) space usage. In addition, as the insert operation of each point is independent, the algorithm has high parallelism. And because the insert operations will not cause the imbalance of the tree structure, the M2M data structure is dynamic. Moreover, it can be shared by all the algorithms based on M2M model which greatly improves the efficiency when a variety of algorithms work simultaneity, such as in image processing and pattern recognition. In all, the M2M model points out a general pattern for designing high parallel algorithms, an efficient strategy for solving multi-operational problems and a new approach for computer to stimulate the thinking pattern of human beings.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of modern wireless communication, communication has become more and more convenient and widely popular. However, due to the broadcast nature of the wireless channel, it is vulnerable to malicious attacks from third parties. During the establishment of UAV networks, given the limited computing power and storage resources of UAVs, traditional encryption methods may adversely affect their performance. Meanwhile, key distribution based on physical characteristics provides a new way of thinking. By utilizing the physical attributes of the channel to achieve key distribution, this method not only provides a high degree of security, but also greatly improves convenience. In addition, compared with traditional schemes, deep learning can automatically learn and integrate features at different levels, avoiding complex selection and combination of algorithms, thus possessing stronger generalization and robustness. Therefore, this paper proposes the use of deep learning techniques to extract channel features to increase the adaptability of key distribution. This approach is expected to provide strong support for the security and reliability of UAV networks.},

  abstract={It is well known that many students struggle and eventually are unsuccessful in their attempt to complete their first computer science course. At Arizona State University, the first course taken by computer science majors and a few other majors is CSE 110. CSE110 teaches first year college students basic programming principles using the Java programming language. In order to do well in this course, students need to not only have a background in basic logical thinking, but also need to know basics about using computers along with Internet and file transfer protocol. To address this problem, a CSE110 workshop has been designed for incoming freshmen that have little or no background in computers. This paper defines the content and instruction of this workshop as well as an assessment of its effectiveness. To help ensure that future freshmen are better prepared, software development curriculum materials are being developed for use at the high school level. Two summer teacher workshops have already been held and a third is planned.},

  abstract={The sixth-generation (6G) network will shift its focus to supporting everything including various machine-type devices (MTDs) in an every-one-centric manner. To ubiquitously cover the MTDs working in rural and disastrous areas, satellite communications become indispensable, while mobile edge computing (MEC) also plays an increasingly crucial role. Their sophisticated integration enables wide-area edge intelligence which promises to facilitate globally-distributed customized services. In this article, we present typical use cases of integrated satellite-MEC networks and discuss the main challenges therein. Inspired by the protein structure and the systematic engineering methodology, we propose three minimal integrating structures, based on which a complex integrated satellite-MEC network can be treated as their extension and combination. We discuss the unique characteristics and key problems of each minimal structure. Accordingly, we establish an on-demand network orchestration framework to enrich the hierarchy of network management, which further leads to a process-oriented network optimization method. On that basis, a case study is utilized to showcase the benefits of on-demand network orchestration and process-oriented network optimization. Finally, we outline potential research issues to envision a more intelligent, more secure, and greener integrated network.},

  abstract={Reconfigurable radio frequency (RF) system has emerged as a promising avenue to achieve high communication performance while adapting to versatile commercial wireless environment. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to optimally program a reconfigurable RF system in order to achieve maximum performance and/or minimum power. Our key idea is to adopt an equation-based optimization method that relies on general-purpose, non-convex polynomial performance models to determine the optimal configurations of all tunable circuit blocks. Most importantly, our proposed approach guarantees to find the globally optimal solution of the non-convex polynomial programming problem by solving a sequence of convex semi-definite programming (SDP) problems based on convexification. A reconfigurable RF front-end example designed for WLAN 802.11g demonstrates that the proposed method successfully finds the globally optimal configuration, while other traditional techniques often converge to local optima.},

The challenge of offering this subject through distance education adds to the complexity, given the need for students to adapt to this mode of teaching and learning, which significantly differs from traditional classroom settings. Multiple studies suggest that students must appropriately develop cognitive and non-cognitive skills for effective learning. Yet, there is a pressing need for further investigation into the impact of non-cognitive skills on student performance, with a particular focus on motivation, which plays an important role in student success. In this sense, considering the specificities of learning programming, the context of distance education, this research aims to understand the factors that can stimulate students' motivation for initial learning of programming, developing a virtual learning environment that promotes student motivation to learn to program and evaluate the environment to identify whether its features have the potential to stimulate student motivation.},

  abstract={This article is about explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for rule-based fuzzy systems [that can be expressed generically, as $y({{\bf x}}) = f({{\bf x}})$]. It explains why it is not valid to explain the output of Mamdani or Takagi–Sugeno–Kang rule-based fuzzy systems using IF-THEN rules, and why it is valid to explain the output of such rule-based fuzzy systems as an association of the compound antecedents of a small subset of the original larger set of rules, using a phrase such as “these linguistic antecedents are symptomatic of this output.” Importantly, it provides a novel multi-step approach to obtain such a small subset of rules for three kinds of fuzzy systems, and illustrates it by means of a very comprehensive example. It also explains why the choice for antecedent membership function shapes may be more critical for XAI than before XAI, why linguistic approximation and similarity are essential for XAI, and, it provides a way to estimate the quality of the explanations.},

  abstract={A number of statistical or grammatical models of natural language have been proposed over the years. All of them work a little bit; none of them work very well. It is easy to make them do something useful; it is extremely hard to make them do a lot more. This ease of initial success has led a number of people to make extravagant claims about computer processing of natural language. The difficulty of extending the success has led a number of people to make equally extravagant claims about what cannot be done with computing systems in natural language. We believe that much, much, more can be discovered through purely syntactic means (the only ones available to computers at present) than has been demonstrated. We also believe that syntax is not sufficient for any kind of understanding of natural language by computing systems, so that these syntactic studies must be augmented with some notion of semantics that relates the syntax to an interpretive context. This paper will describe some interesting and novel mathematical models that allow us to study the syntactic behavior of natural language to a much greater depth than usual, and show how they lead to some interesting experiments.},

  abstract={Introducing coding in early education improves the logical and computational thinking in kids. However, cognitive skills are not sufficient for a successful life. Understanding and managing the emotions of oneself is another crucial factor in success. The current state of the art teaching methods educates the kids about programming and emotional intelligence independently. In our opinion, it is advantageous to teach kids emotional intelligence, along with the programming concepts. However, the literature lacks the studies that make students emotionally aware while teaching them programming. This research aims to prepare students to be cognitively healthy as well as emotionally intelligent with the hypothesis that a kid's emotional intelligence can be enhanced while teaching them cognitive skills. We proposed a computational model that teaches programming and emotional intelligence side by side to students. The model provides a curriculum and related tools. For evaluations, five hundred students of a public school were involved in different activities to find the effectiveness of the proposed model. These students were divided into five groups (A, B, C, D, and E), each having a mean age of 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years, respectively. Students performed multiple adaptive scenarios of path-finding that were based on self-awareness, social-awareness, sharing, and empathy emotions. Students provide the programming instructions such as sequencing, conditional statements, and looping to a robot. The children have successfully improved in both fundamental programming constructs and emotional intelligence skills. The research also successfully reduced screen time problem by providing a screen-free student interface.},

  abstract={Our new supercomputer system, which will begin its operation on July in the Academic Center for Computing and Media Studies, is based on the T2K Open Supercomputer Specifications designed by the collaboration with U. Tsukuba and U. Tokyo. The specifications are not only the result of our new concept and procurement principle, but also the conclusion of the discussion between computer scientists/engineers in the center and computational scientists of a wide spectrum of research field in our university. The collaboration of computer and computational scientists is becoming tight for the high-performance computing on the Open Supercomputer and has already shown its creativity with useful and novel software methods.},

  abstract={In our software-defined radio project, we aim at combining two standards luetooth and HIPERLAN/2. The HIPERLAN/2 receiver requires more computational power than Bluetooth. We choose to use this computational power also for Bluetooth and look for more advanced demodulation algorithms such as a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) receiver. The paper discusses a simplified MAP receiver for Bluetooth GFSK signals. Laurent decomposition provides an orthogonal vector space for the MAP receiver. As the first Laurent waveform contains the most energy, we have used only this waveform for our (simplified) MAP receiver. This receiver requires a E/sub b//N/sub 0/ of about 11 dB for a BER of 10/sup -3/, required by the Bluetooth standard. This value is about 6 dB better than single bit demodulators. This performance is only met if the receiver has exact knowledge of the modulation index.},

  abstract={This paper outlines a new kind of degree that has technology at its core, but is transdisciplinary in nature. Rather than students learning knowledge in discrete disciplinary blocks, they are exposed to ideas and practices from a wide variety of disciplines, and use these to create new ways of working that are underpinned by capabilities in computational thinking, complex systems, data and reasoning.},
