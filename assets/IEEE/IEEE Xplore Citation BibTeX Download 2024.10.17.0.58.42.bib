  abstract={Integrity of rails is the foundation of safe rail transportation. It is critical to detect internal rail flaws in time, and one popular solution to this issue is ultrasonic techniques. On the other hand, long short-term memory (LSTM) has been proven in text classification to which we think the ultrasonic rail flaw detection can be quite similar. In this context, this paper proposes a novel text-style sequential modeling method for ultrasonic rail flaw data and a LSTM-based deep learning model for rail flaw detection. Comparative experiments proved the feasibility and remarkable computational efficiency of the proposed modeling method and model.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence explores the means for computers to think like a human. In this era of technological advancements, the unobstructed method for monitoring activities in daily life is a challenging task. Most of the recent research successfully achieved good performance at the high computational cost. With high computational costs, it is not possible to deploy action recognition methods in real-time scenarios. This research work aims to develop an action classification approach for video surveillance with scalable extension for deployment on edge devices. The input video is preprocessed extensively to extract the maximum information about the actions with all variants, which enables the network to even recognize the actions from an unseen environment. The Hybrid Video Classification (HVC) is the combination of CNN and GRU that are used for feature selection and preserving the preceding information, and in the end, SoftMax activations are used to classify the action labels. We have used HMDB51 and UT-Interaction datasets to train our proposed model. The model is tested in real-time on low end laptop. The experimentation shows that the proposed work recognizes the actions with better accuracy at a low computation cost.},

  abstract={Summary form only given. In the last few decades, a silent revolution is taking place. The exponential growth in microelectronic processing power has been achieved by ever decreasing the size of integrated circuits. These circuits which integrate electrical, mechanical and sometimes optical devices, have evolved from silicon revolution. It replaced big complex, costly systems with small, affordable, high performance microsystems. Microsystems are expected to further enable silicon chips to sense, "think", act, and communicate, in essence, to become intelligent machines. Structures of current microsystems are approaching fundamental limits and the next generation of devices might show unexpected properties due to quantum effects and fluctuations. A new research field is developing in which we pursue understanding of basic physics associated with such quantum structures, explore their controllability, and propose new devices. In this talk, we begin with a summary of engineering problem solving and proceed to discuss the impact of technology on the development of newly emerging discipline of soft computing and computational intelligence. The relationship between technology and intelligent mechatronics are pointed out.},

  pages={163-166},
  abstract={Micro-expression refers to facial expressions that last for an extremely short time, typically less than 0.5 seconds. It can reveal a person's true emotion, which is one of the powerful indicators to judge what a person actually thinks. However, the deployment of micro-expression recognition algorithms onto resource-constrained devices poses a challenge due to their high computational requirements. In this essay, we optimize the identification of microexpression algorithms by using pruning-based lightweight methods. By using unstructured pruning and structured pruning methods, the backbone Resnet-18 network model is subjected to local and global lightweight pruning, respectively, where the network structure is optimized to reduce the time and space costs required for micro-expression recognition algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the original algorithm's performance is enhanced following the pruning procedure with fewer parameters, and it exhibits superior performance on the CASMEII, SMIC, and SAMM datasets.},

  pages={511-514},
  abstract={We present a practical and efficient stereo matching approach which produces a dense disparity map with the pair-wise sequence alignment algorithm based on dynamic programming in this paper. Firstly, pair-wise sequence alignment algorithm based on the dynamic programming is introduced where the optimal alignment of two sequences could be acquired by tracing back the similarity matrix which is constructed according to characters in two sequences using dynamic programming algorithm. Second, we think of pixel gray value of all homonymy epipolar lines in two images in turn as two string sequences, and then disparity of corresponding point in two images is calculated by the number of gaps inserted the optimal alignment in every two string sequences. Additionally, according to epipolar constraint we can know that homonymy epipolar lines in two images parallel to the scan-lines, so the 2D matching of images is simplified to that of 1D. The experiment result shows that the proposed approach is stable and efficient, and it has a high matching accuracy and low computational complexity.},

  abstract={Crowd RE is an emerging avenue for engaging the general public or the so called crowd in variety of requirements engineering tasks. Crowd RE scales RE by involving, potentially, millions of users. Although humans are at the center of Crowd RE, automated techniques are necessary (1) to derive useful insights from large amounts of raw data the crowd can produce; and (2) to drive the Crowd RE process, itself, by facilitating novel workflows combining crowd and machine intelligence.To facilitate automated techniques for Crowd RE, first, we showcase a crowd-acquired dataset, consisting of requirements and their ratings on multiple dimensions for the smart homes application domain. Our dataset is unique in that it contains not only requirements, but also the characteristics of the crowd workers who produced those requirements including their demographics, personality traits, and creative potential. Understanding the crowd characteristics is essential to developing effective Crowd RE processes. Second, we outline key challenges involved in automating Crowd RE and describe, how our dataset can serve as a foundation for developing such automated techniques.},

  abstract={For enhanced education at the level of University courses such as those in biology or biotechnology, one of the key elements is the need of time and expertise to allow the student to familiarize laboratory techniques in par with regular theory. The Sakshat Amrita virtual biotechnology lab project focusing on virtualizing wet-lab techniques and integrating the learning experience has added a new dimension to the regular teaching courses at the University. Establishing virtual labs requires both domain knowledge and virtualizing skills via programming, animation and device-based feedback. Challenges in the biotechnology sector in setting up a laboratory that integrates both the feel and phenomenon includes the medley of multiple techniques. This paper reports one such cost-effective process used in virtualizing a real biotechnology lab at the University-level. The major challenge in setting up an effective knowledge dissemination for laboratory courses was not only the scientific approach of biotechnology, but included the virtualization aspects such as usage/design scalability, deliverability efficiency, network connectivity issues, security and speed of adaptability to incorporate and update changes into existing experiments. This paper also discusses an issue-specific case-study of a functional virtual lab in biotechnology and its many issues and challenges.},

  abstract={Computers have transformed work and play, transportation and medicine, entertainment and sports. Yet for all their power, these machines still cannot perform simple tasks that a child can do, such as navigating an unknown room or using a pencil. The solution is finally coming within reach. It will emerge from the intersection of two major pursuits: the reverse engineering of the brain and the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence. Over the next 20 years, these two pursuits will combine to usher in a new epoch of intelligent machines. Why do we need to know how the brain works to build intelligent machines? Although machine-learning techniques such as deep neural networks have recently made impressive gains, they are still a world away from being intelligent, from being able to understand and act in the world the way that we do. The only example of intelligence, of the ability to learn from the world, to plan and to execute, is the brain. Therefore, we must understand the principles underlying human intelligence and use them to guide us in the development of truly intelligent machines.},

  pages={7713-7717},
  abstract={Despite the great success in Natural Language Processing (NLP) area, large pre-trained language models like BERT are not well-suited for resource-constrained or real-time applications owing to the large number of parameters and slow inference speed. Recently, compressing and accelerating BERT have become important topics. By incorporating a parameter-sharing strategy, ALBERT greatly reduces the number of parameters while achieving competitive performance. Nevertheless, ALBERT still suffers from a long inference time. In this work, we propose the ELBERT, which significantly improves the average inference speed compared to ALBERT due to the proposed confidence-window based early exit mechanism, without introducing additional parameters or extra training overhead. Experimental results show that ELBERT achieves an adaptive inference speedup varying from 2× to 10× with negligible accuracy degradation compared to AL-BERT on various datasets. Besides, ELBERT achieves higher accuracy than existing early exit methods used for accelerating BERT under the same computation cost. Furthermore, to understand the principle of the early exit mechanism, we also visualize the decision-making process of it in ELBERT. Our code is publicly available online.1},

In this way the process of getting the right information and answer gets faster and also more interesting and engaging compared to classic approach. Along with getting the desired answer faster this kind of approach increases motivation of students to spend more time in learning programming because of interesting new technology that is used as an aiding tool in their programming education.

  abstract={We developed three home-made modeling programs to design thermally assisted magnetic recording heads: optical beam propagation method for waveguides, optical finite difference time domain method for plasmon generators, and thermal/micromagnetic finite difference method for the recording media. These models lead to the following results. To get higher throughput efficiency of the waveguide, the periodic wavy thickness of the inlet can provide better inlet coupling with laser diode light, and the wavy taper shape can improve the propagation efficiency. As for plasmon generators, the model requires waveguide, recording media and main-pole to estimate the correct performance, because the optimized design depends on all of these parts. Our proposed sharp pointed plasmon generator can provide tiny near field spot, and it must have good scalability for narrow track recording. In addition to these optics models, we performed recording process simulation. As a result, depending on the condition of the thermal spot and head field alignment, either thermal or magnetic field can be dominant in creating the final magnetic transition in the media. The signal to noise ratio and the transition curvature are greatly affected by the recording process.},

  abstract={In the music industry, researchers have been developing an approach to music as an informational phenomenon for decades. Interest in music as information becomes especially noticeable with the development of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence algorithms are used to determine musical preferences, provide personal recommendations on streaming services, and compose music. Artificial intelligence is predicted to have a strong impact on the music content creation process. Modern music software tools are showing impressive results. However, musical systems based on artificial intelligence lack human intelligence, i.e., the ability to understand the meaning of musical works. Focus on software and insufficient attention to human intelligence indicate that the problem of creating musical artificial intelligence remains extremely underestimated and is one of the urgent problems of modern information technologies. Objective of the research: theoretical substantiation and development of a convergent approach to the creation of musical systems based on artificial intelligence. Methods: information and semantic method for the study of cultural exchanges in the musical environment by A.B. Kayak; theoretical analysis of the probabilistic approach to the problem of meaning by V.V. Nalimov; method of probabilistic evaluation of meanings by S.G. Fadushin. Results: the analytical framework is provided for a convergent approach to the creation of musical systems based on artificial intelligence. The obtained results will allow to create information and control systems based on artificial intelligence in the musical environment. The information provided in the article may be of theoretical and practical interest for researchers and developers of artificial intelligence in the field of the music industry. The results may also be used by teachers, students, graduate students, researchers studying the philosophy and sociology of musical culture.},

However, these methods didn't take human errors in risk assessment work into consideration, thus couldn't solve the problem brought by the influence of human errors on final assessment results. As a result, this paper introduces the Technique for Human Error Rate Prediction (THERP) which is a mature technique in human reliability analysis into the process of information security risk assessment. Combined with current analysis techniques of human errors in computer science and aiming at the calculation process of the risk value of important assets in information security risk assessment, research on the calculation method of risk value considering human reliability is carried out in this paper. The calculation method of human error rates in the entire process of risk value calculation is proposed. An example is provided to verify the method proposed in this paper.},

  abstract={The aim of this study is to investigate the question: “Can Information and Communications Technology (ICT) helps to improve primary school students' geometry achievements for rectangles?” The applied educational software consisted of a story and several activities with and without the use of computers which were designed following the background of Realistic Mathematics Education for geometry concepts; referred to as the ‘Primary Shape Model’ (PSM). In addition, we use a mathematical test referred to as the ‘Primary Shape Test’ (PST) to explore the use of ICT in the primary classroom for teaching basic geometrical concepts. It is a task orientated test which attends to measure the level of geometry competence developed for students of the first grade. The study dealt with students in the first grade of primary school of Athens and Crete, who were divided into two teams (experimental and control). The experimental group consisted of 113 students, who were taught of rectangles by the support of computers. There were 121 students in the control group, which received only the traditional science instruction for rectangles. Students in both groups were pre-tested and post-tested for their geometry performance for rectangles. The results of the study indicated that teaching and learning through ICT is an interactive process for children at primary school level and has a positive effect for geometry education of rectangles.},

  abstract={Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been successfully applied to solving many problems, but in most cases, they are used as black boxes which are not interpretable. That is, even if an MLP can provide correct answers, we cannot understand the reasons why it makes these decisions. In this study, we try to interpret a single hidden layer MLP by discretizing the hidden neuron outputs into 3 values (e.g. -1, 0, and 1). The 3 values correspond to false, unknown, and true, respectively. The basic process is (1) train an MLP first, (2) discretize the hidden neurons, (3) retrain the output layer of the MLP, (4) add more hidden neurons if needed, and (5) induce a decision tree based on the hidden neuron outputs. Experiments on several public datasets show that the proposed method is feasible for acquiring interpretable knowledge.},

  abstract={Within the context of Argentina universities that have computer science degrees in their curricula, one of the major challenges is to teach an introductory programming course for the first semester. The problem appears because the students come with serious deficiencies from their previous education level (secondary schools). Among these deficiencies, we identify their lack of abstraction capabilities and mathematical skills, which are usually considered as prerrequisites to take a programming course. This article introduces the GOBSTONES method for teaching an introductory programming course. The method was developed at the Universidad Nacional de Quilmes in Argentina, taking into account the described background of the students, and has shown a positive impact by improving the passing rate of those students. GOBSTONES method's main goal was to foster abstraction and abstract thinking to students that have not developed good abstraction skills. A programming language, also called GOB-STONES, was developed to implement the ideas presented herein. The method focuses on the representation of information, both at the level of code in the form of procedures to express abstraction, and at the level of the universe of discourse, which is a concrete one, but allowing the representation of information in a simple way. Moreover, the tools implementing GOBSTONES have a feature that enables the student to see a visualization of the represented elements.},

  abstract={With the continuous implementation of application services in the field of artificial intelligence in the industry, the academic research on Al branch science is becoming more and more in-depth. NLP, that is, natural language processing, plays an extremely important role in the transition from the in-formation age to the intelligent age. Computer linguistics, a highly interdisciplinary emerging discipline derived from it, is also developing by leaps and bounds. Chinese natural language processing takes the conversion of natural language as the basic principle, follows the research ideas based on rules and statistics, and appropriately adds some reliable examples to complete the translation process. This paper discusses the key problems of computer linguistics based on Chinese NLP, understands the basic concepts of Chinese natural language processing through detailed analysis, and then studies the key problems and steps of Chinese natural language processing.},
