  abstract={In this issue, Pessoa emphasizes the importance of viewing neural activity from a perspective that functional networks form dynamically in a way that dramatically changes the functional contribution of individual brain areas. In this response, I argue that we should strive toward pluralism in understanding neural activity at both the emergent network and modular levels, on the bases that a purely emergent understanding would be incomplete, and that there are computational advantages to anatomically stable modularity.},

  abstract={Since the turn of the twenty-first century, global digital culture has entered a new stage. Computational analysis of cultural digital artifacts, their online “lives,” and people's interactions with these artifacts and each other have redefined dynamics and mechanisms of culture. This analysis is now used by numerous players—the companies that run social networks, NGOs planning their outreach, tens of millions of small businesses around the world advertising online, and hundreds of millions of people who plan, create, and manage their self-presentation on the web. At the same, fashion companies, book and music publishers, television and film producers, food and beverage companies, hotel chains, airlines, and other big companies in culture and lifestyles industries use big data that is relevant to them and data science to design, test, and market their offerings, and to predict the demand.},

  abstract={In recent years, the emergence of cooperative robots has been facilitated by technological advances, including the development of safety devices. Although these robots are considerably more flexible than conventional industrial robots, when confronted with a new task, the human operator is often left to address related problems unaided. The aim of this research is to develop a smart collaborative robot, where a rapid and accurate robot and a flexible human operator work synergistically to achieve a common objective. In the proposed system, humans and robots work together to tackle the same combinatorial optimization problem; the robot actively engages in problem-solving, while the human has the ability to override the robot's actions if disagreements arise, and to execute alternative actions. To facilitate this collaboration, this paper presents the development of a manipulator that enables two separate control centers the human brain and the robot's computational system to cooperate in solving complex, cognitive-motor tasks.},

  abstract={This paper documents the challenges in creating a computer-aided level design tool which incorporates computergenerated suggestions which appeal to the human user. Several steps are suggested in order to make the suggestions more appropriate to a specific user's overall style, current focus, and end-goals. Designer style is modeled via choice-based interactive evolution which adapts the impact of different dimensions of quality based on the designer's choice of certain suggestions over others. Modeling process is carried out similarly to style, but adapting to the current focus of the designer's actions. Goals are modeled by estimating the visual patterns of the designer's final artifact and changing the parameters of the algorithm to enforce such patterns on generated suggestions.},

  pages={115-120},
  abstract={Fuzzy logic is a way of many-valued computing logic that deals with the truth values of the variables between 0 and 1, unlike the conventional Boolean logic. Membership functions are used to depict the fuzzy values of given variable. Though membership functions are determined through expert's opinion, however, the one estimated through heuristic algorithms is the preferable methods. Membership functions determined through statistical and knowledge engineering methods are usually application dependent and cannot be applied on different datasets. This research focuses on generating the parametric values of the triangular membership function using a novel method. Initially, the Fuzzy C-means algorithm is utilized to generate the parameters values of the Gaussian membership function. Using a set of equations, these values then estimate the parameters of the triangular membership function. The proposed method is applied to the quality of web services data. From the results it is verified that the new approach of generating triangular membership functions can be adopted.},

  abstract={Sustaining open innovation requires better understanding how collaborative efforts of contributors yield collective creativity. One of the significant problems in understanding emergence of collective creativity involves how collectives govern and coordinate the actions of individuals to maximize innovation output. Yet, relatively little is known about desirable organizing processes in open innovation communities. To this end, we examine the impact of governance mechanisms and conflict management styles on collective creativity in open source socio-ecologies. Systems model of creativity and proxy metrics for measuring potential for collective creativity are utilized to conduct a simulation study of open source software socio-ecologies. Findings suggest that decentralized coordination schemes such as emergent selection that are observed in utility communities along with moderate degrees of assertiveness and cooperation for conflict management result in higher incidence of innovation.},

  abstract={The majority of work on artificial neural networks (ANNs) playing the game of Go focus on network architectures and training regimes to improve the quality of the neural player. A less investigated problem is the board representation conveying the information on the current state of the game to the network. Common approaches suggest a straight-forward encoding by assigning each point on the board to a single (or more) input neurons. However, these basic representations do not capture elementary structural relationships between stones (and points) being essential to the game. We compare three different board representations for self-learning ANNs on a 5 times 5 board employing temporal difference learning (TDL) with two types of move selection (during training). The strength of the trained networks is evaluated in games against three computer players of different quality. A tournament of the best neural players, addition of alpha-beta search, and a commented game of a neural player against the best computer player further explore the potential of the neural players and its respective board representations},

  abstract={Digitalisation is the defining concept of the 21st century. Today, there is no area of life that is not digitised, not connected to the internet in some way, not connected to an online platform where the actor or solution is available. Digitalisation cannot be excluded from the education system either. Higher education has long taken advantage of the opportunities offered by digitisation, which greatly facilitates the lives of individuals involved in education. It is an effective and good solution for the educators, but it is also an equally effective and good solution for the learners. In this study, we want to assess the impact of digitalisation on the competitiveness of education and the perceptions of those involved in education, students and learners. We want to assess how the competitiveness of education as a key area can be improved by moving part of education from the physical space to the digital space and how this is received by those involved in education. In this paper, we will present our findings and the context that determines and judges the current state of the art of this issue based on the results of a Hungarian primary research.},

  abstract={ChatGPT is a novel AI tool that poses new questions for experts in education and introduces a need to change traditional instructional and grading systems. The first step towards a successful integration of ChatGPT into educational processes is to understand how students currently use it. In this paper we present our contribution towards this goal, a pilot study analyzing the results of a questionnaire filled out by 300 students of secondary and tertiary education. Our primary conclusions are that students are interested in using ChatGPT in the context of education and that there is no significant difference in the tasks they use it for depending on their academic major. Students use the tool more commonly for topics relevant for their fields and the average satisfaction with the tool grows the more frequently students use it, meaning ChatGPT, like other tools, is learnable.},

  abstract={In the contemporary healthcare sector, the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and emotional intelligence (EI) carries substantial ramifications for practitioners of medicine. Emotional intelligence is becoming an increasingly significant asset for medical professionals, especially in light of the integration of AI technologies into clinical processes, encompassing the ability to perceive, comprehend, and regulate emotions. This research examines the various dynamics of EI within the framework of AI integration, illustrating its importance in numerous domains. An increasing number of medical practitioners are collaborating with AI-driven systems, which creates a nuanced relationship between the analytical prowess of AI and the emotive intelligence of humans; thus, a balance must be maintained. Additionally, this study examines the effects of EI on critical facets of medical education, interactions between practitioners and patients, and overall job satisfaction. This abstract advocates for a stance that underscores the criticality of bolstering EI talents in the face of technological advancements. A harmonious integration that acknowledges the potential conflicts and synergies between EI and AI to support both the cognitive and affective aspects of healthcare practice.},

  abstract={Individual differences in personality determine our preferences, traits and values, which should similarly hold for the way we express ourselves. With current advancements and transformations of technology and society, text-based communication has become ordinary and often even surpasses natural voice conversations- with distinct challenges and opportunities. In this exploratory work, we investigate the impact of personality on the tendency how players of a team-based collaborative alternate reality game express themselves affectively. We collected chat logs from eleven players over two weeks, labeled them according to their affective state, and assessed the connection between them and the five-factor personality domains and facets. After applying multi-linear regression, we found a series of reasonable correlations between (combinations of) personality variables and expressed affect-as increased confusion could be predicted by lower self-competence (C1), personal annoyance by vulnerability to stress (N6) and expressing anger occured more often in players that are prone to anxiety (N1), less humble and modest (A5), think less carefully before they act (C6) and have higher neuroticism (N). Expanding the data set, sample size and input modalities in subsequent work, we aim to confirm these findings and reveal even more interesting connections that could inform affective computing and games user research equally.},

Simple computer-based simulators can significantly help students to establish well-developed holistic views of systems in many engineering disciplines. The 4Screens Web-based simulator has helped hundreds of students in becoming more proficient with electronics systems. It has been developed by a group of undergraduates to make the Four screens model easy to utilise. A student using the simulator can simultaneously display four important characteristics of an electronic system on a computer screen: its algebraic transfer function H(s), systempsilas pole-zero plot, its Bode plots of magnitude and phase, as well as a graph of its time response to a unit step. Questionnaire responses and test performances over the last seven years confirm the effectiveness of the Four screens and the 4Screens Web-based simulator in improving student learning.},

  abstract={In the modern era the world comes nearer to every individual as an IT revolution where all the applications are computerized. As the level of security breaches and frauds of transaction increases, it requires highly secure identification and personal verification technologies. Here user identity plays a very important role to uniquely verify or authenticate the individual person. Instead of designing more complex system, which is more expensive and which requires more software and hardware resources, it is essential to think about to bridge the gap which will create a system with simplicity, less costly and efficient, as well as socially acceptable. The factors which highly impact the face recognition system performance are illumination and pose variations. Feature extraction is the key to reach face recognition. In literature various feature extraction techniques are available. The paper presents six different techniques to generate a feature vector by calculating Centric mean and forward and backward diagonal mean and then apply DCT over it which will reduce the feature vector size and yields less computational complexity giving faster recognition. Experimental tests performed on the ORL and UMIST database achieves a recognition rate of 99 percent, with low computational cost without any pre-processing step.},

Software developers today cannot just be good at writing code; they must also possess non-technical skills in order to work successfully within diverse teams and have an appreciation for the tools and processes needed to build and maintain complex systems. In this work, we describe a novel first-year Software Engineering-First (SE-First) curriculum that introduces students to the broader picture of software development while students learn fundamental computing concepts. To assess the effectiveness of our novel first-year curriculum, we compare students who completed the first-year software engineering curriculum with students who completed our traditional computer science curriculum. We assess student knowledge of computing concepts, and their self-efficacy. Initial results show that students who complete the first-year software engineering courses perform as well or better on the computing concepts test, they are more confident in their computing abilities and in the application of computing skills to their field, and they have a higher success rate in their first-year computing courses (i.e., fewer students drop the course and fewer students receive a D or F course grade) compared with students who complete the traditional first-year computing program.},

  abstract={Memristors have provided a new direction of thinking for circuit designers to overcome the limits of scalability and for thinking of building systems beyond Moore&#x2019;s law. Over the last decade, there has been a significant number of innovations in using memristors for building neural networks through analog computing, in-memory computing, and stochastic computing approaches. The emergence of intelligent integrated circuits is inevitable for the future of integrated circuit applications. This book provides a collection of talks conducted as part of the IEEE Seasonal School on Circuits and System, having a focus on Intelligence in Chip: Tomorrow of Integrated Circuits. Technical topics discussed in the book include: &#x2022; Edge of Chaos Theory Explains Complex Phenomena in Memristor Circuits &#x2022; Analog Memristive Computing &#x2022; Designing energy efficient neo-cortex system with on-device learning &#x2022; Integrated sensors &#x2022; Challenges and recent advances in NVM based Neuromorphic Computing ICs &#x2022; In-memory Computing (for deep learning) &#x2022; Deep learning with Spiking Neural Networks &#x2022; Computational Intelligence for Designing Integrated Circuits and Systems &#x2022; Neurochip Design, Modeling, and Applications},

  abstract={This article explores strategies for cultivating a paradigm shift in the engineering design of intelligent machines, moving from conventional anthropocentric priorities toward a more ecocentric orientation aligned with ecological ethics. Through a comprehensive literature review, historical patterns of anthropomorphism in intelligent systems are traced, revealing how human-centered considerations have persistently dominated machine design across eras. To disrupt this enduring lineage and integrally reorient technology innovation toward ecological balance, four targeted strategies are proposed: (1) adopting question-seeking and systems thinking; (2) designing integrated ecosystems rather than discrete networks; (3) balancing exploitation with exploration; and (4) infusing diverse perspectives through transdisciplinarity. By reforming engineering education and culture from the ground up, the creation of intelligent machines can be realigned to enrich our shared environment rather than simply maximize human primacy. This paper offers a constructive roadmap to transform the promise of increasingly autonomous technologies in the $21^{\text {st }}$ century and beyond.},

  abstract={This research investigates the automatic translation of contracts to computer understandable rules trough Natural Language Processing. The most challenging aspect, which is studied throughout this paper, is to understand the meaning of the contract and express it into a structured format. This problem can be reduced to the Named Entity Recognition and Rule Extraction tasks, the latter handles the extraction of terms and conditions. These two problems are difficult, but deep learning models can tackle them. We think that this paper is the first work to approach Rule Extraction with deep learning. This method is data-hungry, so the research also introduces data sets for these two tasks. Additionally, it contributes to the literature by introducing Law-Bert, a model based on BERT which is pre-trained on unlabelled contracts. The results obtained on Named Entity Recognition and Rule Extraction show that pre-training on contracts has a positive effect on performance for the downstream tasks.},
