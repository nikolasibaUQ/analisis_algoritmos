  abstract={Pictorial visualizations portray data with figurative messages and approximate the audience to the visualization. Previous research on pictorial visualizations has developed authoring tools or generation systems, but their methods are restricted to specific visualization types and templates. Instead, we propose to augment pictorial visualization authoring with visual style transfer, enabling a more extensible approach to visualization design. To explore this, our work presents Vistylist, a design support tool that disentangles the visual style of a source pictorial visualization from its content and transfers the visual style to one or more intended pictorial visualizations. We evaluated Vistylist through a survey of example pictorial visualizations, a controlled user study, and a series of expert interviews. The results of our evaluation indicated that Vistylist is useful for creating expressive and faithful pictorial visualizations.},

  abstract={Can computers overcome human capabilities? This is a paradoxical and controversial question, particularly because there are many hidden assumptions. This article focuses on that issue putting on evidence some misconception related to future generations of machines and the understanding of the brain. It will discuss to what extent computers might reach human capabilities, and how it would be possible only if the computer is a conscious machine. However, it will be shown that if the computer is conscious, an interference process due to consciousness would affect the information processing of the system. Therefore, it might be possible to make conscious machines to overcome human capabilities, which will have similar limitations than humans. In other words, trying to overcome human capabilities with computers implies the paradoxical conclusion that a computer will never overcome human capabilities at all, or if the computer does, it should not be considered as a computer anymore.},

  volume={36},

  pages={3394-3405},
  abstract={Power system state estimation (SE) plays a crucial role in the success of advanced tools employed for power system analysis and control in Energy Management Systems. SE is responsible for providing a consistent real-time dataset, free from errors that may compromise decision-making and put the system at risk. The presence of criticalities involving elements such as network branches, measuring units or measurements may impose difficulties for the detection/identification of gross errors in the acquired data. The simultaneous unavailability of the elements that form a given criticality makes the grid unobservable. This paper presents a flexible and effective network-based methodology for the integrated identification of critical groups of branches, measurements and measuring units in SE. The proposed algorithms are constructed, having the properties of such criticalities as their central pillar. Tests performed with IEEE 14-, 30-, and 118-bus benchmark systems are presented, and the obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  pages={122-131},
  abstract={The interplay between pairs of critical factors such as performance, energy and reliability within modern computing systems has always been an interesting topic of study. However, studying the interplay of all three factors together in a many-core, multi-layer design setting has been a relatively recent undertaking. This work explores the practical problems encountered in such studies and introduces the modelling framework ArchOn, which is based on a novel resource-driven graph representation. ArchOn facilitates the analysis and potentially design and synthesis of systems whose design domains are more conveniently organized into multiple layers or levels (e.g. application, OS, hardware, etc.) and potentially large scale and diverse types of concurrency. The layer-agnostic formalism helps designers reason about cross-layer issues and the resource-driven approach is advantageous for reasoning about such issues as energy and time. Example single- and multi-core case studies help explain and illustrate the method.},

  abstract={The emergence of abstract sciences as a counterpart of classic concrete sciences is presented in this work. The framework of abstract sciences encompasses data, information, knowledge, and intelligence sciences from the bottom up. It is found that intelligence is the ultimate level of cognitive objects generated in human brains aggregated from data (sensory), information (cognition), and knowledge (comprehension). However, there is a lack of rigorous studies and coherent theories towards the theoretical framework of abstract sciences as the counterpart of classical concrete sciences. This paper explores the cognitive and mathematical models of abstract mental objects in the brain. The taxonomy and cognitive foundations of them are explored. A set of mathematical models of data, information, knowledge, and intelligence is formally created in intelligent mathematics. Based on the cognitive and mathematical models of the cognitive objects, formal properties and relationship of contemporary data, information, knowledge, and intelligence sciences are rigorously explained.},

  title={Automated Metamorphic-Relation Generation with ChatGPT: An Experience Report}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={1780-1785},
  abstract={This paper reports on a pilot study of using ChatGPT, a language model based on GPT-3.5 architecture, for automatic generation of metamorphic relations (MRs), in the context of testing of autonomous driving systems (ADSs). The oracle problem is a major challenge in testing such systems, where it is difficult to determine whether or not the output of a system is correct. Metamorphic testing (MT) can alleviate this problem by checking the consistency of the system’s outputs under various transformations. However, manual generation of MRs is often a time-consuming and error-prone process. Automated MR generation can yield several benefits, including enhanced efficiency, quality, coverage, scalability, and reusability in software testing, thereby facilitating a more comprehensive and effective testing process. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT for automatic generation of MRs for ADSs. We provide a detailed methodology for generating MRs using ChatGPT and evaluate the generated MRs using our domain knowledge and existing MRs. The results of our study indicate that our proposed approach is effective at generating high-quality MRs, and can significantly reduce the manual effort required for MR generation. Furthermore, we discuss the practical implications and limitations of using ChatGPT for MR generation and provide recommendations for future research. Our study contributes to the advancement of automated testing of ADSs, which is crucial for ensuring their safety and reliability in real-world scenarios.},

  year={2007},
  volume={},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={The impact of process variations increases as technology scales to nanometer region. Under large process variations, the path and arc/node criticality provide effective metrics in guiding circuit optimization. To facilitate the criticality computation considering the correlation, the authors define the critical region for the path and arc/node in a timing graph, and propose an efficient method to compute the criticality for paths and arcs/nodes simultaneously by a single breadth-first graph traversal during the backward propagation. Instead of choosing a set of paths for analysis prematurely, we develop a new property of the path criticality to prune those paths with low criticality at very earlier stages, so that our path criticality computation method has linear complexity with respect of the timing edges in a timing graph. To improve the computation accuracy, cutset and path criticality properties are exploited to calibrate the computation results. The experimental results on ISCAS benchmark circuits show that our criticality computation method can achieve high accuracy with fast speed},

  abstract={Edge Intelligence (EI) based collaborative learning approaches have been researched in the recent years by several researchers. As majority of existing collaborative learning approaches are designed in the context of servers, design and development of novel systems are required in order to apply collaborative learning in resource constrained devices. Researchers possess different interpretations of the existing collaborative learning approaches. This paper presents an analysis of the existing work conducted on collaborative learning approaches on the domain of EI. The strongholds and drawbacks of the existing work will be analyzed to identify an ideal collaborative learning approach to be applied on the Internet of things (IoT) edge. The analysis will further include an investigation into the future enhancements and research gaps. The partitioned model training approach has been identified as the most ideal approach for the IoT edge based on the conducted critical analysis process. The reduction of communication overhead in the partitioned model training approach and the application of the partitioned model training approach in other unexplored deep learning model architectures have been identified as future research directions. This paper is a work in progress section of an ongoing research and in the future the findings will be used to design a system to apply the collaborative learning approach in IoT Edge and bridge the existing research gaps.},

  title={On the Applicability of Speaker Diarization to Audio Concept Detection for Multimedia Retrieval}, 
  year={2011},
  volume={},

  pages={446-451},
  abstract={Recently, audio concepts emerged as a useful building block in multimodal video retrieval systems. Information like "this file contains laughter", "this file contains engine sounds" or "this file contains slow music" can significantly improve purely visual based retrieval. The weak point of current approaches to audio concept detection is that they heavily rely on human annotators. In most approaches, audio material is manually inspected to identify relevant concepts. Then instances that contain examples of relevant concepts are selected -- again manually -- and used to train concept detectors. This approach comes with two major disadvantages: (1) it leads to rather abstract audio concepts that hardly cover the audio domain at hand and (2) the way human annotators identify audio concepts likely differs from the way a computer algorithm clusters audio data -- introducing additional noise in training data. This paper explores whether unsupervized audio segementation systems can be used to identify useful audio concepts by analyzing training data automatically and whether these audio concepts can be used for multimedia document classification and retrieval. A modified version of the ICSI (International Computer Science Institute) speaker diarization system finds segments in an audio track that have similar perceptual properties and groups these segments. This article provides an in-depth analysis on the statistic properties of similar acoustic segments identified by the diarization system in a predefined document set and the theoretical fitness of this approach to discern one document class from another.},

  year={2018},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={This paper describes the use of different and complementary teaching tools on two consecutive courses on Soil Mechanics (on an integrated master in Civil Engineering). In these courses, project-based learning with collaborative or cooperative teamwork was implemented. The teaching tools adopted and described herein include text processors, spreadsheets and presentations, as well as specialized geotechnical software. The students' perceptions were collected using a questionnaire and the impact of those different tools on the students' perceptions are analysed. Some considerations for future implementations of similar approaches are put forward. The students' perceptions collected allowed concluding that using different and complementary teaching tools in project-based learning can be effective in promoting students' learning. The use of such tools may contribute to the development of both technical knowledge of students and of soft skills. For this case study, the results show that the students considered the computer tools useful in promoting and facilitating the construction of knowledge and in developing several competencies, i.e., in developing their learning processes. Nevertheless, a positive attitude and commitment by both the students and the instructors are essential to successful teaching and learning processes. Getting students on board, by discussing the aims of using specific strategies, is key to promote academic success. Therefore, students must be the centre of all the teaching and learning processes.},

  abstract={We are currently living in an economy driven by data as a form of capital and by increasingly diverse, emerging data accumulation methods. Based on a case study of Innovation Labs, a tech accelerator implemented in Romania since 2013, we discuss the challenges and opportunities for cultivating innovation and entrepreneurship competences that are sensitive to the potential and limitations of big data. Data capitalism has significant implications not only in our everyday life and business, but also on the instruments that we employ to understand the world and to achieve value. The data-based society needs complex information technology to process information, to observe, to map, to extract, to put together streams of data which eventually are leading to decision making and to value creation, including - but not limited to - financial value. Big data applications gather data from heterogeneous activity fields and seek to create insights through their cross-sectional interpretation. How are young tech-oriented people equipped to navigate the data-storm that this global current of digitalization and automation is creating? We will look at the case of Innovation Labs tech accelerator, by analyzing the last four editions of the program in terms of working with (big) data.},

  abstract={Maker education for entrepreneurship and innovation is an important mission of China universities. However, current maker education in China universities has the limitations of closed innovation, efficiency-driven, focal product, specialized organization, and so on. This failed to meet makers' demands for real-time awareness of space, adaptive automatic resources, diverse innovation activities and tools with intelligent support in makerspace. Therefore, the innovation ecosystem has emerged to be the best choice to solve those problems. This paper first analyses fundamental principles and elements of innovation ecosystem, and then discusses essentials and properties of innovation ecosystem-oriented maker(IEOM) education. After that, the model of IEOM education by smart technologies is developed, including innovation subject, innovation activity, and innovation environment. Innovative subjects include experiencers, innovators, researchers and experts. Innovation activities are created by the innovation subjects including interest, research, practice and smart creation. The innovation environment is a creation scenario reflecting innovative subjects' rich creation in participating in innovation activities.},

  abstract={The motivation for this work stems from the falling enrollments in the computing discipline and the subsequent challenge to present the study of computing in a manner that is attractive to a wider range of potential students. This paper seeks to capture a new notion of "curriculum models" and to draw attention to the range of possible approaches programs might adopt. This paper addresses issues that may underpin some of this transformational process. It mentions some of the underlying assumptions regarding the situation and explores the affect of curricula reports in computer science, computer engineering, information systems, information technology, and software engineering as published by ACM and the computer society of IEEE. (Both authors have co-authored some of these documents.) From these reports, the paper explores the framework of new curricula models based on broad strategies for creating or developing a curriculum from organization and orientation points of view. Considerations for these new models would include not only topic areas, but also contrasts between traditional and novel approaches. While the paper addresses some structural models, it also explores integrative approaches such as absorption and separatist models as well as modular frameworks and negotiated programs. This topic is very timely and appropriate given the current crisis facing computing education today.},

This article will be presented the experiences made in the Computer Networks and Protocols for the Internet of Things (IoT) course. The course includes a significant laboratory component where students must put into practice what they learned during the theoretical lessons. In particular, the laboratory exercises involve using specific equipment and devices that can build digital ecosystems for the control and management of well-defined operational contexts difficult to reproduce virtually. Therefore, to give continuity to the didactic activity, it was necessary to redesign the entire exercise system preserving the original educational objectives.},

  abstract={This article reinterprets algorithmic rationality by looking at the interaction between mathematical logic, mechanized reasoning, and, later, computing in the Russian Imperial and Soviet contexts to offer a history of the algorithm as a mathematical object bridging the inner and outer worlds, a humanistic vision that we, following logician Vladimir Uspensky, call the “culture of the impossible.” We unfold the deep roots of this vision as embodied in scientific intelligentsia. In Part I, we examine continuities between the turn-of-the-twentieth-century discussions of poznaniye—an epistemic orientation towards the process of knowledge acquisition—and the postwar rise of the Soviet school of mathematical logic. Establishing this connection allows us to explain, in Part II, the role of the algorithm in disciplinary dynamics between mathematical logic and cybernetics and a characteristic understanding of programming, not as a narrow skill, but as a matter of consciousness.},

We shed fresh light on the subject by conducting a historico-philosophical analysis of the evolution of the concept of the machine. The relation between technology and society is investigated in depth through the prism of culture in the latter and the concept of the machine in the former. The evolution of the technosphere is viewed as a series of mutations in the ontological structure of the machine, moving from the equipmental mode of the mechanical tool and ending up with the intelligent machine then the rhizomatic mode of machinic production. Our approach is multidisciplinary, drawing from several traditions, including science, sociology, the philosophy of technology, ontology, and history.},

  abstract={This Cloud Computing is the emerging trend in distributed computing that encourages researchers to investigate its pros and cons for executing scientific workflows. Scheduling of applications modeled as workflows and executed in high performance distributed computing environments like cloud is a computationally hard multi-objective optimization problem. However, it presents various challenges that need to be addressed in order to efficiently utilize cloud resources for workflow applications. In this paper, the authors have critically analyzed the workflow scheduling algorithms for its pros and cons and thereby identified the research issues in workflow scheduling algorithms. The theoretical analysis of `Enhanced Max-Min' scheduling algorithm suggests that if the algorithm is applied for workflow execution in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Cloud, a higher efficiency/lower `makespan' can be achieved if the characteristics of resources are considered while scheduling workflow tasks. Hence the authors have also proposed an extension of `Enhanced Max-Min' algorithm for workflow execution that considers characteristics of resources and `makespan' minimization as a scheduling parameter.},
