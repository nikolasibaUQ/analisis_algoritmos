  abstract={End-to-end encryption is the best way to protect digital messages. Historically, end-to-end encryption has been extremely difficult for people to use, but recent tools have made it more broadly accessible, largely by employing key-directory services. These services sacrifice some security properties for convenience. We wanted to understand how average users think about these tradeoffs. We conducted a 52-person user study and found that participants could learn to understand properties of different encryption models. They also made coherent assessments about when different tradeoffs might be appropriate. Participants recognized the less-convenient exchange model was more secure overall, but considered the security of the registration model to be “good enough” for most everyday purposes.},

  abstract={The Computer General Course is a general core course in higher education for students of non-computer science majors. With the increasing popularity of computer technology applications and the arrival of the fourth wave of the industrial revolution represented by the industrialization of the Internet, industrial intelligence, and industrial integration, the teaching of Computer General Course under the new situation also faces new dilemmas. The exploration of the integration of C-STEAM with the Computer General Course, which is oriented by culture, provides new paths to achieve the educational goal under the new situation, to realize the integration of the discipline education under the cultural orientation of the course, and to improve the students' sense of learning efficacy in the course. Through the design-based research and 2 years of exploration and practice, combined with student research and work evaluation, the curriculum reform teaching practice recognition and students' cultural literacy, thinking methods, disciplinary integration literacy, etc. have received more positive feedback, and the teaching objectives are achieved to a higher degree.},

  abstract={Accurate software cost and schedule estimation are essential for software project success. Often it referred to as the "black art" because of its complexity and uncertainty, software estimation is not as difficult or puzzling as people think. In fact, generating accurate estimates is straightforward - once you understand the intensity of uncertainty and framework for the modeling process. The mystery to successful software estimation - distilling academic information and real-world experience into a practical guide for working software professionals. Instead of arcane treatises and rigid modeling techniques, this will guide highlights a proven set of procedures, understandable formulas, and heuristics that individuals and development teams can apply to their projects to help achieve estimation proficiency with choose appropriate development approaches In the early stage of software life cycle project manager are inefficient to estimate the effort, schedule, cost estimation and its development approach. This in turn, confuses the manager to bid effectively on software project and choose incorrect development approach. That will directly effect on productivity cycle and increase level of uncertainty. This becomes a strong cause of project failure. So to avoid such problem if we know level and sources of uncertainty in model design, It will directive the developer to design accurate software cost and schedule estimation. Which are essential for software project success. However once the required efforts have estimated, little is done to recalibrate and reduce the uncertainty of the initial estimates. This paper demonstrates terminology and typology of uncertainty is presented together with a framework for the modeling process, Brief reviews have been made of 14 different (partly complementary) methods commonly used in uncertainty assessment its interaction with the broader system development process and the role of uncertainty at different stages in the modeling processes.. The applicability of these methods has been mapped according to purpose of application, stage of the modeling process and source and type of uncertainty addressed.},

  abstract={VR technology refers to virtual reality technology, which can simulate all kinds of things in the real environment, make users integrate into the simulation world and personally experience the change laws and specific characteristics of things [1]. At present, the application of virtual reality technology in training has become a major development trend of physical education. This model can help students improve the effect of physical education learning and further deepen their thinking mode and understanding of knowledge [2]. Combined with virtual reality technology and computer technology, this paper establishes a key action correction method of basketball training based on virtual reality technology. This system is composed of three-dimensional simulation database, capture motion virtual simulation model, motion technology simulation and other parts. The three-dimensional simulation of basketball based on virtual reality technology focuses on the principle, implementation method and specific application of virtual reality technology in the three-dimensional simulation of basketball. Using this method can bring more superior learning environment for athletes.},

  abstract={Feedback controllers are typically applied to computing systems by acting on some quantities (“tunable parameters” in the computer science lexicon, think e.g. of a packet drop rate) in order to attain some goal (e.g., a required bandwidth allocation). In other words, control loops are closed around the computing system, that exposes tunable parameters as control actuators, and allows to measure some performance metrics. In the authors' opinion, the “classical” use of control methods sketched above heavily limits the achievable results. Indeed, many critical parts of computing systems should not be “controlled”, but rather “re-designed in the form of controllers” - quite a novel approach and an interesting research area. This manuscript formalises the statement above and illustrates some results, including a couple of application examples, to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed design approach.},

  abstract={Big data is envisioned as a game changer capable of revolutionizing the way businesses operate in sectors. The purpose of this paper is to present a big-data-based framework for dealing with electricity consumption behavior. This paper conducts an analysis of methodologies in the extraction of electro-information and drawbacks in modeling power consumption behavior through traditional peak-trough pricing. Then, the paper comes up with a fresh thinking on integration of multiple-dimensional, big data platforms, and conducts a penetrating study of pattern identification, relational analysis and deeds of using electricity. The paper designs a data-driven approach on the basis of two huge data manipulation techniques, batch process and flow process, and puts forward an algorithm concerning stochastic matrix relevance, which goes for the relationship between electricity spending and its determinants. Also, empirical evidence is presented concerning verifying robustness and validity of the proposed approach, suggesting that the framework is feasible in performing further electrical data analytics. The paper concludes with pointing out implications for governmental policy formulation, business expansion of power companies and guiding behavior of electricity use as well as quantitative methods for researching related issues.},

  year={2017},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-10},
  abstract={Extant literature shows different measures for business performance of a 'for-profit' organisation; including both financial performance and non-financial dimensions. Key financial performance measures, evident in existing literature, include: profit; revenue; cash flow; and return on investment, among others. Some previous scholars highlighted that without a healthy cash flow, an organisation can fail to sustain itself, even when it records huge profits and high return on investment. This paper explores further the issue of cash flow, as a key financial (and business) performance measure, with a particular focus on controls taken by an Engineering Consultant during the design stage of project execution when he/she forecasts a project cash flow shortfall. A System Dynamics conceptual model of the Engineering Consultant's project cash flow controls (and their associated unintended and undesirable effects) is formulated, in this paper, from existing literature, mental models of contemporary project managers (from an Engineering Consulting firm with many infrastructure projects in South Africa), and Systems Thinking. Results suggest some counterintuitive dynamic hypothesis: controls taken by an Engineering Consultant (aimed at increasing his/her project cash flow) when he/she forecasts a project cash flow shortfall, tend to generate some unintended and counteractive effect - a reduction of the Engineering Consultant's project cash flow.},

  abstract={Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is gaining interest as an emerging paradigm for healthcare improvement. Cyber-security is one of the major issues breaking down its expansion. Indeed, IoMT ecosystem complexities and cyber-attacks development require thinking about smart and efficient security solutions. Machine Learning (ML) techniques are widely used to help detecting abnormalities and intrusions in such environments in order to improve trustworthiness in Connected Medical Devices (CMD). Towards this direction, risk assessment is also proposed to proactively evaluate the security of such platforms. Regarding the complexity and heterogeneity of IoMT, dealing with the inherent security risks is a challenging task. In this context, we aim to evaluate the cumulative risk of CMD based on anomaly detection in IoMT traffic via ML algorithms. Our model relies on anomalies detection coupled with intrinsic risk assessment of medical devices trying to have a holistic risk evaluation for the platform.},

  abstract={Researchers have proposed numerous consistency models in distributed systems that offer higher performance than classical sequential consistency (SC). Even though these models do not guarantee sequential consistency; they either behave like an SC model under certain restrictive scenarios, or ensure SC behavior for a part of the system. We propose a different line of thinking where we try to accurately estimate the number of SC violations, and then try to adapt our system to optimally tradeoff performance, resource usage, and the number of SC violations. In this paper, we propose a generic theoretical model that can be used to analyze systems that are comprised of multiple sub-domains - each sequentially consistent. It is validated with real world measurements. Next, we use this model to propose a new form of consistency called social consistency, where socially connected users perceive an SC execution, whereas the rest of the users need not. We create a prototype social network application and implement it on the Cassandra key-value store. We show that our system has 2.4× more throughput than Cassandra and provides 37% better quality-of-experience.},

  title={The Use of Agent-Based Models As Non-Player Characters in Serious Games}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={One of the shortcomings of many modern serious games and medical simulations lies in their inability to model even some modicum of unpredictability of real life situations. Interactions with a standardized patient may teach healthcare professional students how to diagnose a clinical condition, better manage a patient, or help them improve their bedside manners, but such simulated interactions will not prepare the learners to deal with unpredictability of clinical situations, interruption, and task switching. Distractions occur from colleagues, clinical decision support alerts, pagers, smartphones, or audible alarms. All these interruptions can potentially alter the course of patient care and the outcome of a patient's treatment. A simulated virtual patient (VP) may teach critical thinking skills, but once a student has successfully diagnosed a VP, the simulation stops providing educational value. In this paper we propose a generalizable method for integrating agent-based models into serious games and simulations. In the proposed paradigm, a human player (learner) takes on the role of a single agent in the model (e.g, a healthcare professional), while the output of the model controls the environment, the rules of agent interactions, and all the other agents that the human player interacts with (non-player characters). Moreover, we will present two use cases demonstrating that the use of agent-based models as behavior controllers for non-player characters introduces a degree of unpredictability in a virtual patient simulation and in a serious game designed to teach middle and high-school students about the spread of infectious diseases.},

The system enables freshmen engineering students to enhance critical thinking ability. The power of interactive simulation, animation, artificial intelligence and object-oriented technologies are incorporated to guide the students in the decision-making processes of real-life case studies. The system developed combines theory, experiments, and software tools and can be used in classroom situations or for self/group-learning. The use of intelligent simulation modules is aimed at introductory level environmental chemistry. The currently available three modules are environmentally safe paint preparation process, automobile pollution and fundamentals of gas laws. The teaching strategy of each section of courseware is centered around a text that introduces the fundamentals, theory and links to simulated laboratories.

  abstract={Simulation involves modeling and analysis of real-world systems. This tutorial will provide a broad overview of the modeling practice within simulation by introducing the reader to modeling choices found using six dimensions: abstraction, complexity, culture, engineering, environment, and process. Modeling can be a daunting task even for the seasoned modeling and simulation professional, and so my goal is to introduce modeling in two ways: 1) to use one specific type of model (Petri Net) as an anchor for cross-dimensional discussion, and 2) to provide a follow up discussion, with additional non Petri Net examples, to clarify the extent of each dimension. For example, in the abstraction dimension, one must think about scale, refinement, and hierarchy when modeling regardless of the type of modeling language. The reader will come away with a broad framework within which to understand the possibilities of models and of modeling within the practice of simulation.},

Finally, analysis conducted using survey questionnaires and classroom videos indicates that use of Ability-Driven methodology has motivated students to become active learners and improved engineering practice ability. The Ability-Driven methodology provides an applicable model for a student-centered teaching pedagogy to cultivate students' engineering habits and teach them to think like an engineer.},

  pages={71-76},
  abstract={An important research problem in designing an open virtual world is how to enable virtual currency exchange between multiple virtual worlds and guarantee the exchange fairness when multiple virtual currencies are adopted as virtual payment instruments in virtual trades between virtual worlds. While an existing VMX theory solved the fairness problem in a VERA algorithm based on a Pareto exchange point [3], a new expecation problem has been found such that exchange requesters might submit minimum acceptable rates (MAR) to determine whether to accept VMX systems-generated virtual currency exchange rates. When exchange requestors think the systems-generted rates are lower than MAR, they select not to accept the systems-generated rates. The withdrawal of systems-generated rates creates the expectation problem such that the fairness has been lost due to Pareto exchange point no longer exists. To solve the expectation problem, this paper has developed a new VERA-RS algorithm by extending the existing VERA algorithm based on a newly developed formal expectancy model and a novel m-stage and n-phase three-level computing framework. VERA-RS algorithm has solved expectation problem by achieving a set of satisfied virtual currency exchange rates.},

It draws the conclusion of the multi-distributed and information intelligentized non-center model structure, realizes the openness, transparency and traceability of all kinds of information data, and makes the blockchain intelligent interactive data more visualization, intelligence, humanization and technicalization. According to the intelligent type media of blockchain, large databases are stored and classified, and a partition block data model is established. A chain structure relationship is formed between block data models, and a layer-by-layer oriented structure is formed. The representation design and interaction design of blockchain intelligent interactive data visualization needs to meet the requirement that the cognitive subject and artificial intelligence can work cooperatively and integrate, so as to create a compound cognitive block model.},

By modelling their deployments using different viewpoints, users can ensure a more thorough threat modelling process and can identify threats which might not be identified using Cloud-COVER's default mode.

Creating a custom summary with our own two hands of everything that can be effectively done by text summarization techniques. There is a critical need for this automated method. This project incorporates technologies that are capable of summarizing the text automatically. It implies paraphrasing phrases into a single thought. We propose a hierarchical document that represents an architecture for extraction aggregation that utilizes “Longformer” as a set encoder and “Transformer” as a text encoder to represent text documents properly. This model is referred to as the Long-Trans-Extr model. One of the benefits of using Longformer as a set encoder is that the model can take in lengthy documents with a maximum of 4096 tokens, which only adds a little amount of additional processing. This quick summarization tool can be used by doctors or medical practitioners for quickly analysing emergency or critical patients.},

  abstract={Sentiment analysis is the process of categorizing and locating the emotions represented in a textual source. Sentiment analysis can be used widely in different areas, such as customer review data, feedback data classification, survey responses, and social media comments. Tweets on Twitter contain a variety of sentiments reflecting the perception, thinking, and working background of the user. With the help of the sentiment analyzer, it can define the response of others on any matter or subject of interest. Here, we used machine learning-based NLP (natural language processing) and text analysis technology to define an automated model that can classify the sentiment of a large dataset. Here we used the following three machine-learning classifiers: logistic regression, SVM, and Bernoulli Naïve Bayes. The effectiveness and performance of these classifiers are assessed using F1 scores and accuracy. The accuracy of these models is 83%(LR), 81%(SVM), and 80%(BNB) So logistic regression model provides the best result among these.},

  abstract={Facial expressions are one of the most important elements for our social interaction. Automatic processing and recognition of facial expressions is hence one of the core areas in computer vision, computer graphics, and social signal processing. Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and their extensions are widely used for recognizing facial expressions. Most research in this area, however, is done either with a limited set of emotional expressions (such as the six universal expressions), or it concentrates on extracting facial action units (individual muscle movements) from video sequences. Little research has been conducted to analyze the complex facial movements that occur in conversational contexts. Conversational expressions such as "agree", "disagree", "thinking", "looking confused", however, form an integral part of non-verbal communication and systems that can automatically parse and understand such expressions are a key ingredient for the development of efficient human-computer interaction systems. Since conversational expressions may consists of several sub-expressions and contain complex dynamics, however, standard CRF approaches are not suited for the task. In this paper, we conduct a detailed comparison of CRFs and Latent Dynamic Conditional Random Fields (LDCRFs) for recognizing complex conversational expressions. We show the importance of modeling sub-expression dynamics and discuss challenges for applying LDCRFs to recognize a large set of conversational expressions.},

  abstract={The relationship between Cognitive Theory and Cloud Technology is a learning stage for humans, especially technology users, in various innovations used by users in modeling reasoning to develop human direction toward a better future. It includes learning on a large scale, such as objectively coordinated thinking, which provides for decision-making, social interaction, and access to various technological devices used. The above also focuses on human familiarity with various distributed computing services in cloud technology, including PaaS, SaaS, and IaaS. This research used a systems literature review model for over 20 years (2000 – 2023). Meanwhile, the applications used are Vos Viewer and Publish or Perish. Due to the author's limited access to IEEE, ACM, and WoS, the database used and the focus of the literature is the Scopus Database. In five years (2019–2023), the writing purpose accounted for only 55 articles, with 39 explicitly addressing cognitive theory and human behavior in the context of cloud technology. In this research, five factors influence human behavior with cloud technology: social interaction, access and connectivity, problem-solving, decision-making, and data confidentiality security. However, of the five impacts entered and obtained from the papers and journals studied, the most critical findings from this research are social interaction, data privacy and security, and decision-making. People will use cloud technology for social interaction, to protect and maintain the confidentiality of their data, and to make various decisions related to their activities. This research also shows that most references come from journals, not conference proceedings articles.},

  title={Effects of Cropping vs Resizing on the Performance of Brain Tumor Segmentation Models}, 
  year={2024},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={This study investigated the effects of image resizing vs cropping on the performance of state-of-the-art models for the brain tumor segmentation task. This is particularly important since many studies simply resize the image without thinking about potential effects of image distortion on the model's segmentation performance. Since the objective of tumor segmentation is to predict the pixels that comprise the actual tumor, image cropping was performed in order to focus more on the brain and the tumor and not on the background. This conjecture was tested using state-of-the-art models namely 2D U-Net, 2D U- Net with VGG19 as backbone, 2D U-Net with InceptionV3 ad backbone, and 2D U-Net with InceptionResNetV2 as backbone. Three different configurations were designed for this purpose. The first configuration used resized images while the second configuration used cropped images. The third configuration used pretrained weights of models of trained on the resized images and then applied them on the cropped images. Overall, the top three models are 2D U-Net with InceptionResNetV2 as backbone trained using the resized images followed by 2D U-Net trained also using the resized images and then finally by 2D U-Net trained using the cropped images. As to why cropping did not perform well in this experiment, several plausible explanations were provided in this study.},

  pages={401-406},
  abstract={In nature, marine cephalopods (such as Mimetic octopus) not only have strong ability of thinking conversion, but also have superior ability of bipedal walking, so the robot adopts the method of octopus bipedal movement. Aiming at the locomotion analysis of the underwater bionic robot, the U-SLIP model is adopted. In order to solve the problem of the difficulty of parameters determination and the walking distance of the underwater bionic robot, a parameter optimization method for U-SLIP model of the underwater bionic robot based on RNA genetic algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the U-SLIP model is built and its dynamic differential equation is solved to get the trajectory of the center of mass. In the process of modeling, through the analysis of the parameters such as buoyancy, resistance, leg extension speed and stiffness coefficient, the gait of the swing phase and the punting phase of the robot is described. Secondly, the appropriate fitness function is designed, and the parameters of U-SLIP model are optimized by RNA genetic algorithm. Finally, the simulation based on MATLAB shows that the optimized model can not only achieve stable walking, but also walk farther in the same time, and the appropriate optimization trajectory is gotten, which the effectiveness of the algorithm for parameters optimization is verified..},
