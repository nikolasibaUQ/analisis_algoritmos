  abstract={The fast advancement of machine learning (ML) techniques has brought about both innovative opportunities and unprecedented security challenges. In this paper, we consider the some important field of machine learning conduct a critical survey and analysis of machine language security and its importance, attacks and threats, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of the evolving landscape in cybersecurity. We begin by elucidating the fundamental concepts and terminologies associated with ML attacks, laying the groundwork for an in-depth exploration. Subsequently, we categorize and dissect various types of ML attacks, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, model inversion, and membership inference, among others. Real-world case studies and examples across different domains, such as computer vision and natural language processing, are scrutinized to reveal the intricacies and implications of these attacks. Furthermore, we evaluate existing defense mechanisms and countermeasures, assessing their effectiveness against different attack scenarios. Finally, we discuss the broader societal impacts and ethical considerations surrounding the deployment of ML technologies in security-critical applications. this paper provides the tools to handle the machine language’s attacks and their solution using integration of academic research with real world examples.},

  abstract={With the appearance of 2D graphical user interfaces in the 1980s, users began to carry out most operations on 2D icon-based interfaces instead of using line-based terminals. With the emergence of smartphones in the 2010s, the notion of portable 2D graphical user interfaces was born, and by today, users accessing digital services are no longer tethered to a single location. All of these advances have led to immense changes in our conceptualization of digital information systems, the effects of which are difficult to overestimate. Recent developments in virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR), as well as in Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) are poised to lead to the next major breakthrough in this series of cognitive expansions, bringing to the forefront portable, context-aware spatial interfaces. A consequence of these developments is that users are expecting to be able to access a growing multitude and variety of digital content in ways that are increasingly contextualized and personalized, i.e., relevant to the time, location and topic from the perspective of the users’ personal history. In this paper, we propose an adaptive content labeling and storage model that is suitable to these challenges. Our model, called the Graph-Indexed Tensor Store (GITS) has the benefits of being adaptive and personalized, while also allowing for content retrieval to be carried out based on associative search operations. In a preliminary analysis of the model, we address the challenges of what we refer to as syntactic, semantic and pragmatic saturation, and provide ways to quantity and further explore their effects.},

  abstract={Individuals aged 20 years and over are considered. We identified participants as having diabetes if they had a HbA1c level greater than 6.5 %. People with diabetes who say they do not actually obtain care is deemed to be untreated for the purposes of this research. In this research, we used logistic regression to assess which risk factors were correlated with untreated diabetes. The aim of Review Machine learning (ML) is to diagnose, cure, and prevent diabetes. While a number of ML models have been created, they are not relevant to real- world scenarios yet. There has been a significant disconnect between ML architects, health care researchers, physicians, and patients in their technologies. Our aim is to perform an in-depth analysis on ML to recognize the potential and shortcomings of the technology. Recent advances in the development of insulin delivery devices, diabetes retinopathy diagnostic methods, and other medical studies have significantly helped people diagnosed with diabetes. Compared with these, the usage of statistical methods for diabetes treatment is only at an early level. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) employs several highly creative ideas to get their drugs to the consumer.

  abstract={TikTok has rapidly become the most popular social media application which offers creative and entertaining features. However, its excessive consumption carries the risk of addiction along with significant distraction. Multiple studies have found that the use of social media has also been linked to an increase in the risk of mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, self-harm, and suicide ideation. The aim of this research is to identify and investigate the potential destructive impact of TikTok on society, specifically on the mental health and well-being of young people. This study quantitatively evaluates the data collected from an online survey distributed to a large number of young Tiktok users. The study explored the nature and extent of TikTok usage among young individuals and examined the potential impacts of TikTok usage on mental health outcomes. The researchers have found that gender differences linked to self-assessment, addiction and the fear of missing out (FOMO) could lead to more anxiety, depression and worsen self-esteem. However, pressure for higher visibility support creativity and skill development while longer TikTok usage leads to addiction as in the case of other social media platforms.},

  abstract={The results of enormous climate change and other industrial carbon emissions have been driven by the rise of nonrenewable traditional energy sources. The scientific community is looking at unconventional renewable techniques that can harvest energy in the external atmosphere. This research article provides a critical analysis of the growth in the field of piezoelectric energy harvesting. Recent advances in bio-inspired piezo-smart equipment are critically analyzed. A comprehensive overview of harvesting power from mechanical vibrations and its renewable sources, such as human body movements, flowing fluid, and circuitry arrangements of structures with piezoelectric materials have been discussed. Capturing and converting mechanical energy into useful electric power is the easiest and most prevalent way to harness the massive amounts of ambient energy around us. With the help of piezoelectric materials, vibrations induced by mechanical sources can convert into electrical energy. Various industries, including transportation, construction, aeronautical, smart systems, micro-fluids, biomedical devices, and implantable electronics, employ piezoelectric energy generating at the micro level. Piezoelectric energy generating technique’s applications along with their achievements, and future possibilities are critically analyzed. This overview concisely presents the extensive range of piezoelectric materials for wireless electronic devices that use eco-friendly, renewable, and sustainable energy harvesting sources.},

  abstract={Portfolio management consists of deciding what assets to include in a portfolio given the investor's objectives and changing market and economic conditions. The always difficult selection process includes identifying which assets to purchase, how much, and when. This paper presents a novel memetic neuro-fuzzy system for financial portfolio management (MNFS-FPM) which emulates the thinking process of a rational investor and generates the optimal portfolio from a collection of assets based on a chosen investment style. The system consists mainly of two modules: the generic self-organizing fuzzy neural network realizing Yager inference (GenSoFNN-Yager), to predict the expected return of each asset, and a memetic algorithm using simplex local searches (MA-NM/SMD) to determine the optimal investment weight allocation for all assets in the portfolio. Experimental results on Dow Jones industrial average (DJIA) stocks show that the proposed system yields better performance compared to that of existing financial models: statistical mean-variance analysis and capital asset pricing model (CAPM).},

  abstract={In this paper, a design model that regards an interactive application as a set of processes is described. Each process can be specified using the IMPG (Interactive Multi Flow Graph) model, a process model that combines Petri Net models properties with users' cognitive aspects. In this way, several perspectives of interactive applications are offered to designers; these are behavioral, informational, causal and contextual. IMFG is used as the specification model of a graphical tool that supports the design of interactive applications as the continuous refinement of users' goals, thus forcing designers to "think in users' terms". The strongest feature of IMFG is that it can be adapted to every domain of interactive applications. As an example, the model application to the design of the user interface of a highly-interactive authoring environment is briefly presented.<>},

  abstract={Most HPC clusters are now based on an x86 architecture and Linux. In a Grid consisting of such clusters, users might think that a single executable file, a data set, and a single job script will work in all cluster environments. However, due to the lack of interoperability of MPI library implementations, file systems, and batch job systems, users need to be conscious of the runtime environments over the Grid. In order to overcome such differences, we propose a runtime environment called Xruntime consisting of the following three components. MPI-Adapter is middleware between the user program and an MPI implementation to make it possible to execute a single executable code on different MPI implementations. Catwalk is transparent file staging middleware that makes remote files accessed by an application visible as if they were located in the local system. Xruntime allows a user to use various clusters with single batch job script language the user is familiar with, without learning other batch job script languages used on other clusters.},

  abstract={Dementia is the main cause of disability in elderly populations. It has been shown that the risk factors of dementia are a mixture of pathological, lifestyle and heritable factors, with some of those being provably modifiable. Early diagnosis of dementia and approaches to slow down its evolution are currently the most prominent management methodologies due to lack of a cure. For that reason, a plethora of home-based assistive technologies for dementia management do exist, with most of them focusing on the improvement of memory and thinking. The main objective of LETHE is prevention in the whole spectrum of cognitive decline in the elderly population at risk reaching from asymptomatic to subjective or mild cognitive impairment to prodromal Dementia. LETHE will provide a Big Data collection platform and analysis system, that will allow prevention, personalized risk detection and intervention on cognitive decline. Through the subsequent 2-year clinical trial, the LETHE system, as well as the respective knowledge gained will be evaluated and validated. The scope of the current paper is to introduce the LETHE study and its respective novel platform as a holistic approach to multidomain lifestyle intervention trial studies. The present work depicts the architectural perspective and extends beyond state-of-the-art guidelines and approaches to health management systems and cloud platform development.Clinical Relevance — Patient Management Systems as well as lifestyle management platforms have significant clinical relevance as they allow for remote and continuous monitoring of patients' health status. LETHE aims to improve patient outcomes by providing predictive models for cognitive decline and patient adherence to the multimodal lifestyle intervention, enabling prompt and appropriate medical decisions.},

  abstract={Classification is the key and most widely studied paradigm in machine learning community. The selection of appropriate classification algorithm for a particular problem is a challenging task, formally known as algorithm selection problem (ASP) in literature. It is increasingly becoming focus of research in machine learning community. Meta-learning has demonstrated substantial success in solving ASP, especially in the domain of classification. Considerable progress has been made in classification algorithm recommendation and researchers have proposed various methods in literature that tackles ASP in many different ways in meta-learning setup. Yet there is a lack of survey and comparative study that critically analyze, summarize and assess the performance of existing methods. To fill these gaps, in this paper we first present a literature survey of classification algorithm recommendation methods. The survey shed light on the motivational reasons for pursuing classifier selection through meta-learning and comprehensively discusses the different phases of classifier selection based on a generic framework that is formed as an outcome of reviewing prior works. Subsequently, we critically analyzed and summarized the existing studies from the literature in three important dimensions i.e., meta-features, meta-learner and meta-target. In the second part of this paper, we present extensive comparative evaluation of all the prominent methods for classifier selection based on 17 classification algorithms and 84 benchmark datasets. The comparative study quantitatively assesses the performance of classifier selection methods and highlight the limitations and strengths of meta-features, meta-learners and meta-target in classification algorithm recommendation system. Finally, we conclude this paper by identifying current challenges and suggesting future work directions. We expect that this work will provide baseline and a solid overview of state of the art works in this domain to new researchers, and will steer future research in this direction.},

  abstract={The main content of this study is the human-machine collaborative design research, taking the car body design as the carrier. The research framework focused on two phases of car body design process, that of design ideation and evaluation. In the ideation stage, we trained an imperfect Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) model that just could generate blur automobile images as the blur design motherboards for the iterative sketching, which had design uncertainties and blanks, thus activating designers’ subjective initiative and aesthetic intuition to provide more creative deepen sketches. We leveraged motherboards to address uncertainty through sketching and aesthetic intuition, refining options and ultimately selecting an optimal design. In the evaluation phase, we initially constructed a parametric 3D model with 20 parameters based on the optimal design, and invited 32 designers conducting participatory design experiments, getting 1024 human-designed schemes. Following this, we administered an online survey to assess the aesthetic qualities of a total of 1024 design schemes. Leveraging the collected score data (The first round of surveys engaged 279 participants, while the second round involved 73 participants), we trained an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to serve as an aesthetic evaluation score predictor for unknown parameter configurations. The machine could evaluate designs autonomously, thus selecting best design from 20,000 schemes generated randomly by machine. We utilized the parametric design converting sketching images to the numeric parameters, switching the qualitative ideation to the quantitative evaluation, thus achieving aesthetic evaluation and optimization. This study explores the relationship between human cognitive intuition and machine intelligence and how they can collaborate with each other.},

  pages={1534-1537},
  abstract={LncRNAs have been discovered to play important roles in biology processes and progression of some severe genetic diseases, such as cancer. However, a number of lncRNAs is lack of function annotations. To understand the functions of lncRNAs is a key step for biology and medical research. Computational method is more suitable for large-scale experiment than biological experimental method due to time and expense, and it can provide reference and basis for biological experiment. Nonetheless, developing computational method to predict function of a newly detected lncRNA is still a challenging task. Some lncRNAs work according to binding with proteins, so calculating interaction preferences of lncRNA-protein may provide novel breakthrough to develop new computational approaches. In this work, we propose a novel lncRNA function prediction method to link function of lncRNAs and RNA binding protein. The method consists of two steps: firstly, we improve the CNN models of DLPRB, a high-performance deep neural network for protein-RNA binding preferences prediction, secondly, we apply a voting algorithm to predict lncRNA function by integrating binding preference predicting models. As we know, it is the first time that using RNA-protein preferences to predict function of lncRNAs. We test the predicting approach with 25 lncRNAs from LncBook, and the results confirm our approach makes sense. The approach only uses sequence-based features, so it can be a novel choice for newly detected lncRNA function prediction. We think this work can provide new insights for lncRNA research.},

A total of 44 teens played it via a lab study and two summer camps. Principle by principle, the results revealed strengths, problems, and open questions for the seven principles.

  abstract={Schools, universities, and other educational entities are increasingly aware of the untapped potential of digital transformation, an essential process for increasing efficiency and collaboration, and reducing costs and errors in the management of at-scale training systems. In this context, the “Riconnessioni” project was promoted by the Compagnia di San Paolo in agreement with the Ministry of Education but planned, started and developed by the Foundation for the School. The digital transformation started with a defined strategy that leveraged opportunities presented by new technology while meeting the objectives of system stakeholders. Through several steps, that strategy was developed for education connecting everything to support tomorrow’s digital world and creating strong strategic partnerships able to build an ecosystem connecting people, processes, and things into a powerful, secure, and smart communications network. This paper reports on the three-year Riconnessioni project, which is combining the energies of teachers, managers, administrative staff, students, among others, and experimenting with new learning models, taking advantage of opportunities that emerged from perceptions stemming from concerns and systemic issues. To date, more than 150 schools in Italy have been included in the project, together with 550 teachers selected to scale up the instructional process. Using a methodology called “cascade training”, the 550 selected teachers were able to spread the knowledge to more than 2,600 colleagues. The monitoring and evaluation activity performed in Riconnessioni aims at processing information on implementation and results, following three lines. First, it regularly evaluates project activities from a reporting standpoint. Second, it verifies the plan consistency against implementation achievements. Third, it identifies changes produced and focuses on teachers’ and students’ skills to evaluate the effects of the project. The assessment framework is also discussed in this work, reporting on results regarding feedback, follow-up, and effects gathered from the field. The evaluation highlighted that labs were indeed able to improve teachers’ competence and underlined the added value of cascade training which spread digital domain knowledge and awareness into the group of involved schools.},

  abstract={This Research to Innovative Practice Full Paper presents a multidisciplinary, design-based research study that aims to develop and study pedagogical models and tools for integrating machine-learning (ML) topics into education. Although children grow up with ML systems, few theoretical or empirical studies have focused on investigating ML and data-driven design in K-12 education to date. This paper presents the theoretical grounds for a design-oriented pedagogy and the results from exploring and implementing those theoretical ideas in practice through a case study conducted in Finland. We describe the overall process in which middle-schoolers (N = 34) co-designed and made ML applications for solving meaningful, everyday problems. The qualitative content analysis of the pre-and post-tests, student interviews, and the students' own ML design ideas indicated that co-designing real-life applications lowered the barriers for participating in some of the core practices of computer science. It also supported children in exploring abstract ML concepts and workflows in a highly personalized and embodied way. The article concludes with a discussion on pedagogical insights for supporting middle-schoolers in becoming innovators and software designers in the age of ML.},

  abstract={This study reports the use of a physical robot and robot simulator in an introductory programming course in a university and measures students' programming background conceptual learning gain and learning experience. One group used physical robots in their lessons to complete programming assignments, while the other group used robot simulators. We are interested in finding out if there is any difference in the learning gain and experiences between those that use physical robots as compared to robot simulators. Our results suggest that there is no significant difference in terms of students' learning between the two approaches. However, the control group that uses the physical robot shows a more positive response in their attitudes towards computing. We discuss the implications of our findings in relation to engaging students and challenges in using physical robots from the learner perspectives and ways to alleviate this. Finally, by considering the insights from students' comments, we also suggest an alternative that may give both benefits of using both physical robots and robot simulators.},

  title={Engaging Students in Computer Science Education through Game Development with Unity}, 
  year={2019},

  abstract={Learning how to code by creating video games promises high motivation, engagement and fun for the students. In this study, the Unity Game Development Environment, a widely spread tool for professional game developers, was employed for teaching secondary school students to develop their own video games. The research design for the game development activities followed a Design-Based Research approach. The learning design was based on situated learning accompanied by a mix of tutorials, teacher explanations and support & collaboration amongst the students. The results of the first iteration of Design-Based Research confirmed the hypotheses that video game development was fascinating and engaging for the majority of young learners. Using a professional tool with an embedded physics engine provided additional attraction for teenagers. From the first cycle of game development we learned that dealing with the complexity of the development environment in a systematic way, time management, advanced teachers' competencies in handling the environment, and providing well balanced learning materials are crucial to successfully employ a professional tool like Unity in secondary education. Besides improved materials and a stepwise process of adding complexity e.g. by starting with developing mini-games, the most important change for the second cycle is to significantly extend the time allocated for game development. This seems justified due to the vast spectrum of skills and competences students tend to acquire when collaborating on complex and exciting issues like developing games.},

  title={The Best Laid Plans or Lack Thereof: Security Decision-Making of Different Stakeholder Groups}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={48},
  number={5},
  pages={1515-1528},
  abstract={Cyber security requirements are influenced by the priorities and decisions of a range of stakeholders. Board members and Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) determine strategic priorities. Managers have responsibility for resource allocation and project management. Legal professionals concern themselves with regulatory compliance. Little is understood about how the security decision-making approaches of these different stakeholders contrast, and if particular groups of stakeholders have a better appreciation of security requirements during decision-making. Are risk analysts better decision makers than CISOs? Do security experts exhibit more effective strategies than board members? This paper explores the effect that different experience and diversity of expertise has on the quality of a team's cyber security decision-making and whether teams with members from more varied backgrounds perform better than those with more focused, homogeneous skill sets. Using data from 208 sessions and 948 players of a tabletop game run in the wild by a major national organization over 16 months, we explore how choices are affected by player background (e.g., cyber security experts versus risk analysts, board-level decision makers versus technical experts) and different team make-ups (homogeneous teams of security experts versus various mixes). We find that no group of experts makes significantly better game decisions than anyone else, and that their biases lead them to not fully comprehend what they are defending or how the defenses work.},

  title={Developing a Critical Robot Literacy for Young People from Conceptual Metaphors Analysis}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={This Research-to-Practice Full Paper presents a reflective analysis of robotic literacy activities focused on children and teenagers. Robotic literacy is integrated or being integrated into the education system for children at an early age all around the world. Most of the teachers in charge of this education lack skills and are left to fend for themselves. This study proposes to focus on the discourses made by teachers and learners during such activities, and especially the metaphors used spontaneously. It takes shape through two robotic literacy activities. The first activity involved the robots BeeBot, BlueBot and Ozobot in seven classes of children from 3 to 10 years old. The second activity consisted of a five half-days training for 13 participants from 8 to 15 years old. They designed, built and programmed a robot. Young people's representations and interactions with robots involved in educational activities are observed to contribute to the development of questions for critical technology education. Analyses are carried out using the conceptual metaphor theory of Lakoff and Jonhson. Three roles are identified: the metaphor that helps to understand, the metaphor that makes tangible, and the metaphor that serves as a catchphrase. A metaphor can take more than one role and, whatever its role, can be classified as a living or non-living metaphor. Using living metaphors may hide aspects of the machine and raises ethical issues, inter alia. It is then essential to deconstruct young people's representations of the machine. This can be achieved by analyzing robots as social constructions that reflect human intentions.},

  year={2017},

  pages={91-98},
  abstract={Recursion is a powerful conceptual tool, nevertheless it is often considered too abstract and technical to be effectively proposed in lower secondary school. Here we present our experience in introducing 8th graders to recursive strategies where the active observation of recursive algorithms execution allowed pupils to understand the main features of a recursive process, to convince themselves that it works, and to unveil the mystery of its effectiveness. In fact, by focusing on the self-similarity of the input data and the possibility to delegate blindly the solution of subproblems, pupils were able to recognize the heuristic potential of recursion. We started with an unplugged activity using LEGO bricks where a recursive algorithm was executed by pupils, and we continued with an activity supported by a software tool we developed ad-hoc. The undertaking was concluded by the abstract consolidation of the basic concepts and properties which had come out during the previous activities.},

  abstract={Contribution: A technical course in a multidisciplinary university program has to provide high-level skills, with limited lecturing hours and student background. This article investigates the principles for its design and reports about a study case. Background: The overall course organization needs to address specific learning targets and teaching techniques, different from those used in traditional courses on the topic. Research Question: A stepwise strategy assists a principled design that allows dynamic, long-term improvements. Methodology: The evaluation of its applicability requires a years-long record of historical data. The article studies the evolution of a course over six years using simple monitoring techniques: surveys and rubric-based examinations. Findings: Monitoring emerges as an essential feature for course evolution: a focused examination provides the best results, while institutional, wide-spectrum surveys appear to be of little help.},

  pages={150-156},
  abstract={In order to strengthen the interest of students in the field of programming, robots are increasingly being used in courses of study with information technology content. This article describes the use of the robot Vector, manufactured by Anki, in a controlled laboratory experiment with undergraduate students. The aim of the research was to investigate the influence of robots on the motivation of programming beginners from the perspective of the students. The data of the study was collected using the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory. The subsequent analysis was performed using descriptive statistics and Chi2-tests. In addition, a computer-aided content analysis as well as a factor analysis was used as a second evaluation method. The research results showed a consistently positive influence of the Vector robot on the motivational behavior of the students. In particular, significant dependencies between the female gender and individual subcategories of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory could be demonstrated. The generalization of the research results is limited due to the small sample size and the exclusive participation of programming beginners.},

  abstract={This Full Paper of Innovative Practice research shows results that could help to avoid some challenges faced by those who seek to learn how to program. To help improve learning, educators need a deep understanding of the obstacles students must overcome; otherwise, teaching strategies will be uncertain. Moreover, a shallow understanding of topics learned in introductory programming courses can negatively influence the learning of future topics. With the above motivation, we conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with instructors who teach introductory programming courses and we also collected diaries kept by 110 students during their studies. The qualitative analysis of these data revealed connections between the studied contents such as dependencies. Our analysis shows that many difficulties arise from the incorrect application of the knowledge necessary in learning new content, usually because the student has not learned earlier topics or learned them superficially. The main contribution of this paper is a theory that describes the connections among topics of learning how to program, showing the influence that knowledge about one can have on others.},
