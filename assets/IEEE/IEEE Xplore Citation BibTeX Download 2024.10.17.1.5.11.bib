  abstract={Face Detection has become a very prevalent issue in Machine Learning, not only in machine learning but in any field, one can think of. Due to this, it has gained a wide fan base and many people are working every day to improve the accuracy of object detection models using deep learning. But this improved performance comes at the price of increased computational overhead, which limits the ability of a machine learning model to be utilized on devices having small Graphical Processing Units. The core intent of this paper is to compare computation time for models such as Histogram of Oriented gradients (0.4 seconds) and ResNet (48.5 seconds) with BlazeFace (0.09 seconds), a model developed by google in the year 2020 and is a mobile device friendly model and fits well with real time application which need instant feedback and on top of that cannot handle bulky computations required for deep learning models.},

  title={Modeling: A computer science concept for general education}, 
  year={2015},

  abstract={For all computer scientists the term `modeling' is well known. It displays an often-used method, which is applied in each field of computer science to investigate, describe and plan problems or structures. With the help of models, large and complex structures are divided into smaller parts, which leads to a better understanding of the problem and often provides input for the solution. With the help of different types of models, different perspectives of one problem can be observed and discussed. These processes are not only part of computer science respectively computational thinking. Problem solving skills are needed in any domain and should be trained as well as possible in primary and secondary education. This could be supported by the computer science concept of modeling including processes like reduction, decomposition, abstraction, generalization etc. and appropriate techniques like UML Unified Modeling Language or the Entity-relationship model. We suppose that a consequent use of modeling beginning in different subjects during primary and secondary education can train and improve problem-solving skills. Before being able to verify this hypothesis, it is necessary to find a way to integrate modeling in schools despite of not being part of the curriculum. This is one aim of our project “Informatics - A Child's Play”, which tries to implement different computer science concepts in different subjects of primary and secondary education. To reach this goal we firstly have to convince and train teachers. In this paper some topics of modeling are presented as they were adapted for workshops in primary and early secondary education considering the age and interests of the students as well as topics taken from their surroundings. Furthermore, we present first evaluation results concerning its acceptance and usefulness for teachers and students as well as their performance in understanding and applying modeling in different lessons.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1179-1182},
  abstract={Increasing the number of social media users and the way these users write the regional languages have pushed the researchers to think about the originality of these languages. The native speakers are in fear that with time the regional languages may lose their originality. For such reason, the correctness checking at the time of writing is an important task in the field of natural language processing. The conventional methods for checking the correctness of a sentence are normally carried out by applying various syntactic and semantic rules and the rules are endless because of the free word order nature of the Assamese language. On the other hand, in the computational filed, the data-driven models are more appropriate than the rule-based system and the data-driven model is free from the rules. In this research work, a data-driven model is designed by using the different types of n-gram models like unigram, bigram, and trigram to check the correctness of the Assamese sentences along with the linear interpolation method. Assamese is one of the twenty-two official languages of India, predominantly spoken in Assam and its neighboring states. A corpus of the size of around 1 million words is used to train the system. During testing, four different levels of experiments are carried out one for the correct sentences and incorrect sentences. The F1-score of the system in correcting the users' sentences is above 60%.},

  abstract={A computational thinking under simulated environment with amendable properties is promoted. It is exemplified on a real drum boiler multi-loop linear control. The model is based on the boiler-turbine plant P16/G16, which is oil-fired and the rated power is 160 MW, at the Sydvenska Kraft AB Plant in Malmö, Sweden. A proficient symbolic and numerical combination points out a fast and very efficient automatic engineering calculation. This contribution aims at tailor-made small simulators on Matlab for those industrial processes which are linked by heat energy. A first application at drum boiler with linear control meets a useful know-how to guide thoughts on how to translate physical fundamentals to Matlab codes for other industrial cases. Some comments relating to industrial practice are offered in this context.},

  abstract={Students' emotional state plays a vital role in learning. In this study, we examined the emotional changes of 69 students during the lectures of the C Language Programming Foundation and Computational Thinking in central China. This paper presents a method using Yolov7 and the convolutional neural network CoAtNet to monitor students' emotional evolution by analyzing their facial expressions and recognizing academic affective states, including boring, confused, focus, happy, and neutral. The trained model has achieved a test accuracy of 76.0%. The results showed that focus increased at the beginning of the first 10 minutes of class and then began to decline. With the decline of focus emotion, students' neutral emotions increased. We found that when a new teaching session is performed, or the teaching method of naming questions is used, the students' emotion of focus increases briefly, lasting about 8–10 minutes. Subsequently, even if the varied teaching method was used to stimulate students' attention, their level of engagement did not increase significantly. It can be suggested that teachers can use teaching methods appropriately to promote students' attention. However, students' attention span is limited, and teachers should pay attention to methods and time to improve teaching quality effectively.},

  abstract={Software applications are designed with a concrete purpose in mind, specified by business owners basing on the individual requirements. The user-system interaction is specified in the analysis phase. This phase specifies inputs, outputs, interaction etc. These elements could be specified separately based on the target platform. The designers know that the mobile clients could have a different application flow than desktop clients. However, this is not a rule and designers often times do not think about the user context nor do they consider the application context. This implies that outputs, inputs and interactions do not change automatically during the software life cycle. In this paper we present techniques that are able to determine whether the user, which is in a particular context, should be required to spend his/her time to fill in fields that are not needed for accomplishing a specific business task. Moreover, these techniques are able to determine whether the fields should display or are not necessary, as well as how the system might interact with the user. Finally, we present a computational architecture that is able to make these types of determinations.},

  pages={765-770 vol.2},
  abstract={Faulty behavior of complex industrial systems is usually detected by deviations from expected values of performance parameters, regarding the system's utilities. When the isolation is performed by human diagnosticians, they use shallow knowledge on faulty cases, and deep knowledge on laws governing the installation running, both imprecise in variable values and in their relations. The paper presents a fuzzy-neuro architecture for a computational model, handling the imprecision of human-like thinking on faults and behavior of the conductive flow systems in industry. The primary effects isolation from the secondary effects proceeds in a modular fashion, based on four transport anomalies detected on the flow power disturbance in each (bond graph) junction of interconnected components. The manifestations take a fuzzy representation and the multiple links between manifestations and faults is represented and processed by productive neural networks. The modular structure of the diagnosis system reflects the modular structure of the target system, hence the faults-effects mapping is simpler and the isolation of faults is more precise.},

  abstract={Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Human brain is a learning system. Human have to learn by getting exposed to something. This capability of learning system to recognize new patterns is called generalization. The abilities of human brain to perform generalization are yet to be matched by neural network or even by any of artificial intelligence algorithm in general. Thus, the need for new machine intelligence approach is imperative. Neural network is designed to take advantages of the speed of computers to solve engineering and computational complex problems intelligently. On the other hand, human brain is somewhat not computationally powerful. Human brain is not even able to calculate quadratic problems within milliseconds. Instead, it uses its vast amounts of memory to store everything human know and have learned. According to a modern neuroscience theory named memory-prediction framework, introduced by Hawkins and Blakeslee in 2005, human brain uses this memory-based model to make continuous predictions of future events. Therefore, a hybrid approach that possesses the ability to compute like neural network and at the same time think like human brain will shed some light in the advancement of machine learning research as well as the development of a truly intelligent machine. This talk discusses the memory-prediction framework and proposes simplified single cell assembled sequential hierarchical memory (s-SCASHM) model instead of hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) in order to speed up the learning convergence. s-SCASHM consists of single neuronal cell (SNC) model and simplified sequential hierarchical superset (SHS) platform. The SHS platform is designed by simplifying to have a region with four rows columnar architecture instead of having six rows per region as in human neocortex. Then, the s-SCASHM is implemented as the prediction engine of user behavior analysis tool to detect insider attacks/anomalies. As nearly half of incidents in enterprise security triggered by the Insider, it is important to deploy more intelligent defense system to assist the enterprise be able to pinpoint and resolve any incidents caused by the Insider or malicious software (malware). The attacks evolve; however, current detection systems that use the deep learning techniques cannot perform online (on-the-fly) learning. Thus, an intelligent detection system with on-the-fly learning capability is required. Experimental results show that the proposed memory model is able to predict user behavior traffic with significant level of accuracy and performs on-the-fly learning.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-7},
  abstract={Objective: The objective of this paper is to present preliminary work on the development of an EduChatBot tool and the measurement of the effects of its use aimed at providing effective feedback to programming course students. This bot, hereinafter referred to as tutorBot+, was constructed based on chatGPT3.5 and is tasked with assisting and providing timely positive feedback to students in computer science programming courses at UCSC. Methods/Analysis: The proposed method consists of four stages: (1) Immersion in the feedback and Large Language Models (LLMs) topic; (2) Development of tutorBot+ prototypes in both non-conversational and conversational versions; (3) Experiment design; and (4) Intervention and evaluation. The first stage involves a literature review on feedback and learning, the use of intelligent tutors in the educational context, as well as the topics of LLMs and chatGPT. The second and third stages detail the development of tutorBot+ in its two versions, and the final stage lays the foundation for a quasi-experimental study involving students in the curriculum activities of Programming Workshop and Database Workshop, focusing on learning outcomes related to the development of computational thinking skills, and facilitating the use and measurement of the tool’s effects. Findings: The preliminary results of this work are promising, as two functional prototypes of tutorBot+ have been developed for both the non-conversational and conversational versions. Additionally, there is ongoing exploration into the possibility of creating a domain-specific model based on pretrained models for programming, integrating tutorBot+ with other platforms, and designing an experiment to measure student performance, motivation, and the tool’s effectiveness.},

These Professional Development (or PD) sessions are meant to help K-8 teachers develop their understanding of core computing concepts (such as algorithms, programming, data analysis, and networks) and thereby develop strong computer science programs for their students. In order to offer effective and meaningful Professional Development (PD) sessions, our research team first intended to understand the perceptions and experiences of K-8 teachers about Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) education. This paper presents the results of a K-8 teacher survey that we conducted as a pre-cursor to our PD series. The results of this survey provided valuable insights about elementary and middle-school teachers' perceptions of computer science education, self-perception of their ability to teach and learn CS, and understanding of CS discipline and those who typically engage in CS activities. The impact of teachers' perceptions impact how leaders in education and the CS industry can meet the needs of teachers, who in turn can meet the growing demand of CS education in K-8 schools.},

  title={A new method to estimate ocean-bottom-seismometer orientation using teleseismic receiver functions}, 
  year={2019},
  volume={221},
  number={1},
  pages={893-904},
  abstract={The orientation of an ocean-bottom-seismometer (OBS) is a critical parameter for analysing three-component seismograms, but it is difficult to estimate because of the uncontrollable OBS posture after its deployment. In this study, we develop a new and effective method to estimate the OBS orientation by fitting the amplitude of direct P wave of teleseismic receiver functions. The reliability of this method is verified using synthetic data and observed waveforms recorded at land seismic stations in Shandong Province, China. Our extensive synthetic tests show that our new method is little affected by a thin sedimentary layer that has a low S-wave velocity. The orientations of OBS stations that we deployed in the Yap subduction zone in the Western Pacific Ocean are estimated and corrected using our new method. After the correction, the direct P waves of teleseismic receiver functions show very good consistency. The effects of white and coloured noise in different levels, epicentral distance and backazimuth are also investigated, and the results show that these factors have small effects on the new method. We also examine the effect of sensor tilting on estimation of the OBS orientation, and find that a tilting correction should be made before the misorientation correction. We compare the OBS orientations determined with the new method and other methods and find that they are generally consistent with each other. We also discuss advantages and shortcomings of various methods, and think that our new method is more robust than the existing methods.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={207-209},
  abstract={The rapid growing application of language models (LLMs) in education offers exciting prospects for personalized learning and interactive experiences. However, a critical challenge emerges - the risk of "hallucinations," where LLMs generate factually incorrect or misleading information. This paper proposes Comparative and Cross-Verification Prompting (CCVP), a novel technique specifically designed to mitigate hallucinations in educational LLMs. CCVP leverages the strengths of multiple LLMs, a Principal Language Model (PLM) and Auxiliary Language Models (ALMs), to verify the accuracy and educational relevance of the PLM's response to a prompt. Through a series of prompts and assessments, CCVP harnesses the diverse perspectives of various LLMs and incorporates human expertise for intricate cases. This method addresses the limitations of relying on a single model and fosters critical thinking skills in learners within the educational context. We detail the CCVP approach with examples specifically applicable to educational settings, such as geography. We also discuss its strengths and limitations, including computational cost, data reliance, and ethical considerations. We highlight its potential applications in educational disciplines, including fact-checking content, detecting bias, and promoting responsible LLM use. CCVP presents a promising avenue for ensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of LLM-generated educational content. Further research and development will refine its scalability, address potential biases, and solidify its position as a vital tool for harnessing the power of LLMs while fostering responsible knowledge dissemination in education.},

  abstract={Derby is a collection of independent computational entities that exchange money for work and information in the course of solving some problem. The key to building an agoric system is to design a monetary incentive structure that forces the individual entities to cooperate and work on the user's problem. While building Derby the authors discovered that it is very useful to think of the entities as being opportunistic and uncooperative. In Derby, information is traded in marketplaces, with sellers issuing predictions and placing bets on their correctness at predicting incoming data streams. Buyers submit bids of how much they are willing to pay for each dollar of bet placed. A sealed-bid second-price double auction determines which bidders are accepted. Later, the buyers report how happy they were with the information they bought, and this determines each seller's winnings in the parimutuel betting pool.<>},

  abstract={Film-based cameras were replaced with digital cameras in a very short period. Saving film costs for each shot is not only of advantage of this transition. The more important advantage by this digitization is that forming optically a completed image on detector is not necessary and acquired data are processable by a computer. We can think that, with optional optical system-lens array-, acquired data can be nuggets of information which contains both image and its depth or bunch of incident rays which are equal value to actual 3-D scene. These data represent 3-D situations and by computing them, various optical effect, e.g. focusing and changing field of depth, can also be realized or simulated virtually. My issue is to clarify how 3-D scene is transformed and expressed on 2-D detector and how this 2-D information is retrieved back again into 3-D scene through lens array and other optical devices. Light-field optics or lens array is one of those exchangeable methods of the transformation between actual 3-D scene and information encoded on 2-D plane. Recently new method for lens array was introduced; a circular zone plate instead of lens array. As for a 3-D Display which consists of flat display and lens array, the encoded data shown on a flat display and they are retrieved into real 3-D image by a lens-array. I will mention not only its advantage but its limitation of ability for 3-D image reconstruction.},

  abstract={Recursion is a typical algorithm design method, which plays an important role in training students to use computational thinking to analyze and solve problems. The BOPPPS model is a popular student-centered teaching mode at home and abroad in recent years, which emphasizes the participation of students and timely teaching feedback. In order to explore an effective teaching mode, this paper designs a recursive algorithm teaching design method combined with boppps model, which can effectively improve the participation of students and improve the quality of teaching.},

  abstract={Information used in existing ontology matching solutions are usually grouped into four categories: lexical information, structural information, semantic information, and external information, respectively. By summarizing and analyzing the approaches for utilizing the same kind of information, this paper finds that lexical information is mainly analyzed based on text and dictionary similarity. Similarly, structural information and semantic information are mainly analyzed based on graph structure and reasoner, respectively. The approaches for aggregating information analysis results are discussed. Challenges in the analysis of various types of information for existing ontology matching solutions are also described, and insights into directions for future research are provided.},

  year={2013},

  abstract={Product definition in space where objects are represented in a single contextual model brought a new thinking in work of engineers. This thinking is around the intended interaction with processes those are available for handling of objects in product modeling. Engineer defines a contribution to modify a product model development of which is result of contributions from various fields of engineering. Essential question is that what level results of human thinking process on objects can be applied as input at the model development. The answer depends on communication and representation capabilities of modeling procedures. This paper introduces a new definition of human interaction levels from the lowest to a proposed high level allowing input also on lower level if necessary. Increasing the level is the way towards intelligent product definition procedures. The proposed high level method realizes communication of awaited product characteristics and features together with methods those are assigned to fulfill these product characteristics and features. This paper is a new contribution to the earlier published coordinated request based product modeling (CRPM) methodology.},

  abstract={Computers are man-made machines which work according to the given set of inputs and perform some operation on the input to generate a new set of outputs. They can be programmed to perform huge and complex task yet they lack imagination and ability to understand things. On the hand human brain is a machine which can learn new tasks by process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience and the senses. To make computer work or think like human, human brain modeling of machine is necessary. We need to know how human brain works. The basic component of human brain is neuron, which make us think and do smart things. Brains have billions of neurons and they communicate with each other using electrical impulse. These impulses are responsible for making brain think and to have a consciousness. This paper proposes such a model of a part of the brain.},
