  abstract={Experiential learning, a latest popular method to guide students' individual practice, lays more emphasis on cognitive teaching than metacognitive teaching. In response to the above problem, this study creatively proposes a six-stage model of experiential learning for the theme of time management. A 28-day experiential activity was conducted in three classes of the same department. According to the interview record, most participants gave high praise to the overall experiential learning activity. Moreover, the results of the pre-test and post-test showed that the time management competencies of the participants improved. This paper provides a new design scheme to improve students' time management competencies, and to extend the understanding of experiential learning into the realm of metacognitive learning.},

  abstract={The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare is revolutionizing medical information access and professional advice delivery. This study focuses on the development of a medical-specific question-answering model leveraging the Qwen-VL 7B model, an advanced Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM), to enhance the understanding and generation of medical texts. The Qwen-VL 7B model's capabilities in both language and visual comprehension make it an ideal candidate for medical question-answering systems, which require a deep grasp of medical knowledge and language. The research objectives include adapting the Qwen-VL 7B model to medical terminology, utilizing its visual understanding for medical imaging analysis, optimizing question-answering systems for medical scenarios, and evaluating the performance of these models. To achieve these goals, we employed methodologies such as dataset construction, model fine-tuning, and user studies. Results showed that the Qwen-VL-Mediacal model achieved a Rouge-1 score of 0.6147, indicating its potential for medical applications. However, challenges remain, such as understanding complex scenes and abstract concepts. Future research will aim to improve the model's adaptability and reasoning capabilities.},

  abstract={With the continuous development of modern information technology, English learning methods and approaches are gradually diversified, especially the English electronic dictionary, which makes English learning easier. The quality of translation is an important criterion to measure the results of English interpret, which is mainly characterized by errors in translation characters or spelling, inconsistent expression, lexical and grammatical errors, etc. At present, the most advanced machine translation method, the so-called phrase-based model, is only limited to the mapping of small text blocks. Because language information is not explicitly used, it may be morphological, syntactic or semantic. This paper designs an English machine translation model based on modern intelligent recognition technology. Through the direct maximum entropy model, we can get the best combination of different features in complex English sentences, eliminate some structural ambiguities and improve the accuracy of English machine translation. Based on modern intelligent identification technology, this paper studies the development of English intelligent proofreading system, grasps the user's behavior data through behavior log, and optimizes the system. The software part of the system PP. adopts the computer intelligent proofreading method based on the improved phrase translation model to find the correct words to replace the words to be proofread and realize the intelligent proofreading of English interpret.},

  pages={171-174},
  abstract={Generative AI presents both opportunities and challenges for primary and secondary teacher capacity development. With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), combining AI with teachers' ubiquitous learning is a topic of concern. This study discusses the necessity of building a ubiquitous learning model for teachers based on big model technology from three perspectives: the research status on ubiquitous learning and LLMs, policy, and teachers' needs, constructing a framework for LLMs to empower teachers' ubiquitous learning for three major scenarios: teaching, teaching and research, and learning. The LLMs can assist teachers to automate the generation of learning situation analysis, teaching objectives and teaching resources to improve efficiency and teaching quality. In the teaching and research scenarios, the LLMs help to develop training content, evaluate teaching and optimize suggestions to improve the teaching and research. In the learning scenario, the LLMs provide personalized resources, stage summaries and evaluation to promote teachers' professional development. In addition, this study proposes the design idea of generative AI prompts to optimize teachers' learning experience and help them better apply the LLMs for ubiquitous learning. However, here are still some potential challenges and risks in the application of LLMs in education. Therefore, we explored the challenges and risks of teacher’ s collaboration with LLMs and propose responses to them. At the same time, we also prospectively analyzed the iteration and development trends of LLMs technology and explored the potential impact of future technological advances on teachers' pervasive learning and professional development.},

The findings will be part of a methodological framework to evaluate whether or not AI is a high-value digital tool in this context. Approach: The study is designed through a series of workshops with architecture students, which aim to identify the role of image-based AI in the architecture design process for under-graduate students in Sino-foreign higher education institutions in order to assess the potential of using AI in the future architecture industry, especially for junior architects. Findings: The preliminary findings of this ongoing study indicate that AI increases the creativity of architecture design concepts, especially via better visual presentation for junior students. However, AI does not seem to be able to comprehend basic architecture design principles when it is implemented. Originality/value: The outcomes of this study will aid the larger teaching community when adopting AI in their teaching while mitigating the potential negative impacts on the students' learning experiences.},

  abstract={The demand for well-trained nursing professionals is ever-increasing, necessitating efficient placement processes post-graduation. This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict B.Sc. Nursing placement outcomes, aiming to optimize workforce management and graduate placement efficiency. Traditional placement methods often suffer from subjectivity and inefficiency. Leveraging historical placement data and relevant features, ML algorithms discern patterns to forecast individual placement likelihood accurately. Various ML techniques including logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and ensemble methods are employed and evaluated for their predictive efficacy. The CN2 rule inducer model emerges as the top-performing model, demonstrating superior discriminatory ability and accuracy. These findings offer significant implications for nursing education institutions and healthcare organizations, facilitating better alignment of education with workforce demands. However, the study also emphasizes the importance of balancing model performance with interpretability. Further research and implementation efforts are warranted to refine predictive modeling approaches and seamlessly integrate them into nursing education and workforce management practices, ultimately contributing to the advancement of nursing practice and patient care delivery.},

  abstract={Tenons are typical wood structures in Chinese ancient architecture, but it is difficult to understand the structures and connection principles because it is impossible to disassemble ancient buildings. In this paper, we present an immersive interactive learning system for tenon structure training with virtual reality (VR) technology and motion detection technology. This VR learning system includes four modules, model database, software environment, hardware environment, and human-computer interaction module. We provide immersive learning experience, the integrated interactive feedback and natural gesture interaction in this system. The survey results after usability test show that student's learning interest and efficient are promoted significantly by using this immersive VR interactive learning method.},
