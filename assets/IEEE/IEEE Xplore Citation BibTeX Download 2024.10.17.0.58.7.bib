  abstract={In recent years, there has been a remarkable increase in interest and challenges in image processing and pattern recognition, specifically in the context of air writing. This exciting research area has significant potential to advance automation processes and improve human-machine interfaces in various applications. The emergence of faster computers, affordable high-performance video cameras, and the need for automated analysis of videos has led to an increase in the popularity of object tracking, a critical task in computer vision. The process of video analysis typically encompasses object detection, tracking, and behavior analysis. Object tracking involves four main aspects choosing the suitable object representation, selecting features for tracking, detecting the object, and tracking the object. Object tracking algorithms find applications in different domains, including vehicle navigation, video indexing, and surveillance that are automated. The objective of the paper is to create a software application for smart wearable devices that utilizes computer vision to track finger gestures in the air, functioning as a motion-to-text converter for air-writing. The technology will facilitate communication for people by enabling them to generate text for multiple purposes, like sending emails and messages, through intermittent gestures. This is a productive means of communication that curbs the usage of laptops and mobiles, making it particularly beneficial for individuals who are deaf.},

  abstract={The advancement in technology related to artificial intelligence, or AI, has been a hot topic of debate in recent years. One concern is the possibility of job loss when machines with algorithms take over tasks that formerly required human labour. It analyses the implications of artificial intelligence technologies on the job market, paying particular attention to how it can decrease the demand for physical labour and perhaps oust employees from their professions. The distribution of wealth, salaries, efficiency, and job abilities are all areas where AI has the capability to have a significant impact. The paper also looks at the ethical implications of AI, such as how it will impact privacy, bias, and decision-making. The study outlines the potential dangers and benefits of AI on work and provides insights for policymakers and stakeholders to lessen adverse effects and realize the potential benefits of AI through a thorough analysis of the available literature and case studies. The study concludes that AI can change how work is done and that proactive steps must be taken to solve potential problems and take full advantage of the opportunities that AI presents. Overall, the present study provides an in-depth knowledge of how AI will impact the workplace, placing a strong focus on the potential for job displacement and creation, the impact on salaries and output, and the need for ethical considerations.},

  abstract={In the course of creating and analyzing music content, artificial intelligence systems are widely used, and according to the forecasts of analysts, their use in the field of music will grow steadily. Modern artificial intelligence systems successfully solve problems that cause difficulties for humans. However, these systems lack the ability to create and evaluate the semantics of musical works the same way as humans do. The problem of creating musical artificial intelligence with the creative abilities of the human mind is one of the most topical and complex problems in the music industry. The solution to this problem in the first place lies in studying and understanding the essence of the term “Musical Sense”. The purpose of the study is to develop a concept for the probabilistic assessment of the musical texts' semantics based on the concepts of information theory and information technologies. To achieve the goal, a convergent approach to the study of the problem of musical meaning, proposed by Professor A. B. Kayak, was used. As a result of the completed study, the main conceptual provisions of the theory of probabilistic evaluation of musical senses have been developed. The article is of a theoretical nature. However, the materials of the article may be of practical interest for researchers of the problem of sense and developers of artificial intelligence in the music industry.},

  abstract={In this paper I presented an algorithm which could be used as a controller technique for access systems in highly-secured environments. Highly-secured environments like critical infrastructures have to count less significant but more effective risks, which may lead to a fatal effect in the society. More stringent regulations involve more reliable access systems, which use mostly multimodal biometrical identification. Soft-computing techniques, especially fuzzy logic is suitable as a controller algorithm in a multimodal biometrical identification system. To highlight the advantages of this method, I modeled a comparison between the statistical mean value calculation and the fuzzy logic adapted controller.},

  abstract={Permeability is a crucial factor in oil and gas exploration and development, as it indicates a reservoir's ability to flow. To predict permeability from electrical exploration results, Critical Path Analysis (CPA) is commonly used by combining reservoir permeability and electrical conductivity. However, the accuracy of CPA decreases when unconventional reservoirs exhibit strong anisotropy, such as fractured shales. This study presents tensor-based CPA methods that utilize equivalent electrical parameters and permeability tensor to address this issue. The approach involves obtaining critical pore radius and permeability in tensor form through matrix operation. The accuracy of the CPA formula in calculating reservoir permeability is then compared with numerical simulation results. The findings indicate that the tensor-based CPA method significantly improves the permeability prediction accuracy of anisotropic media, and further improvements can be made using the revised tensor-based CPA.},

  title={Semantic Segmentation for Visually Adverse Images – A Critical Review}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={28-33},
  abstract={Semantic Segmentation is one of the high-end visual tasks that has remained a topic of interest in various domains. Segmentation of visual scenes was confined to the extraction of object boundaries present in the image data. However, with the progressive developments in technology, machines are expected to produce assistive decisions to aid versatile tasks. Subsequently, these assistive decisions are dependent on efficient results and must project information on a granular level from the visual scenes. The visual scenes are usually of vast variety depending on the scenarios in which the image data is captured. As per recent trends, semantic segmentation is still an open area of research, one of its worth mentioning challenges is to handle the visually adverse images. These visually adverse images are the result of low light/ high light, rain, fog and sometimes in the form of too many objects present in the scene. The study sheds light on the non-trivial problem and diverts attention to the gaps present in literature by providing in-depth critical analysis. This study comprehensively presents unidentified problems prevailing in existing semantic segmentation techniques. A critical literary study is conducted to examine the working mechanics of existing solutions to identify their limitations to produce accurate results for the visually adverse scenarios. The study discusses some of the possible reasons which result in erroneous semantic segmentation results for visually adverse images. Finally, the problems and challenges to be tackled are concluded which highlight the future direction of analysis.},

The factors were then used to estimate the factor scores of all other statements through multiple regression analysis and to select the most appropriate respondents. The factors, however, have been obtained without taking into consideration the categories of the Q&A statements. In this paper we therefore investigated whether the consideration of categories could lead to obtaining more apparent tendencies and precise results to select the most appropriate respondents. In this paper, factor analysis is applied to the experimental results with a consideration of the following categories: Auction, PC, Love, and Politics. As a result of factor analysis, both similarity and difference could be observed for each category of Q&A statements. Comparing the new results with the previous one, two similar main factors could be obtained regardless of the category considered. On the other hand, factors other than the two have were also obtained for each respective category. This shows that the number of factors obtained for each category varies.},

The bottom-up approach has been proved as more effective in process improvement applied to technical and scientific environments, in oppocition to standard improvement models such as ISO or CMMI. However, when bottom-up is applied to elicit improvement areas, the method is usually limited to the use of surveys that miss many of the root causes and structural deficiencies. To complement the elicitation process, we propose the use of requirement-gathering techniques such as Card Sorting, Kelly Grid and Multi-Voting. Initial results are discussed in this paper.},

There are several business excellence models available which are very famous amongst businesses, government and private accreditation agencies, regulators and policy makers. ISO has remained an all-time favorite quality standard for businesses. In the journey of excellence, most of the companies start with getting them in line with ISO standards and get certification. EFQM has also become very popular amongst modern day businesses as it sets more comprehensive view of business excellence and quality assurance. The aim of this paper is to understand the significance of business excellence and its internationally recognized models such as EFQM and ISO which assist in improving business performance. The paper also intends to highlight the similarities and dissimilarities between the two models and their implementation. Also, this is an effort to compare the two models (ISO and EFQM) to see their relevance and impact in the area of quality assurance and business excellence.},

This emphasized the need and the quantity of graphics that we are all faced with. Here Java is the language of our choice since it is already enriched with built-in classes for platform independent graphical user interface, and that it supports picture, animation, sound and network capabilities. Turtle graphics has been implemented in a Java programming language as a Java applet. The implementation of turtle graphics in Java is important because it brings the expressiveness of LOGO to Java language.},

  abstract={In this paper we introduce the Crayon Co-Create (C2Create) drawing tool as a mixed-initiative design approach for fostering the creativity of young learners. C2Create follows the principles of mixed-initiative iterative design utilizing variants of novelty search for generating abstract drawings that act as a visual disruptor during the creation process. The authoring tool finds a multitude of uses both as a standalone gameful activity and, most importantly, offering abstract visual assets that can form parts of game components across various types of games that can either be shared in a social environment or played.},
