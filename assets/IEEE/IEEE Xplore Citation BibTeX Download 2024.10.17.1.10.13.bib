  abstract={Microservices have been making waves among forward-thinking application development organizations. In the realm of software development, software architecture holds paramount importance because it serves as a guiding force to shape the entire life cycle of a software system. Software architecture is a foundation for complex digital components built upon a software system. Within this domain, two prevalent paradigms, monolithic and service-oriented architecture (SOA), stand distinct. While monolithic simplifies development using its integrated structure, SOA reduces complexity through modular services. However, both paradigms suffer severe scalability, development cycle, and flexibility challenges. Subsequently, microservice architecture as a modern paradigm emerges to overcome these challenges. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the paradigm shift from monolithic to microservice architecture. It begins with exploring the monolithic and SOA conceptual landscape and their pros and cons. After that, we delve into the microservice platform, including its basic architecture and implementation stages. Furthermore, we provide the trend of the paradigm shift that highlights the recent developments in the field and identifies the research challenges associated with it. Thus, the paper brings multiple research dimensions for the researchers and lets the software and application development teams improve resilience and expedite their time to market.},

  abstract={The accepted view of programming, rooted in Turing's fundamental characterization of algorithms, has had a profound impact on the theory and practice of computing with yet broader implications for thinking about mind and culture. Where programming is traditionally conceived in terms of requirements, specification and implementation, this paper argues for a complementary conceptualization to support the development of the next generation of computing applications. It briefly reviews an extended programme of research into empirical modeling, an approach to creating interactive environments to enable programming based on identification and prescription},

  abstract={Cybernetics, as defined by Plato and later by Ampère is the science of governance. In the 1940s, Wiener used cybernetics as an umbrella term to refer to control and communication in both the animal and the machine. In the following decades, the term has been defined in various ways by different researchers, and because of this, cybernetics has been perceived rather negatively as a “nomad science”. Consequently, few people understand the true meaning of cybernetics. For the appropriate development of our field of research, we think it is necessary to re-consider the meaning and the scope of cybernetics, so that we can have a relatively clear mission in our research. In this paper, we try to provide a kind of governance message that might also be very weak, but nevertheless may be helpful for the cybernetics community to become cybernetic itself.},

  abstract={Though 20 years have passed since the birth of CSCW, the original goal of it is not reached as well as people expected. This situation is mostly due to the supporting technology especially the infrastructure. Today, great changes have taken place in technology, including grid computing and Web services. These technologies, we think, significantly affect the application of CSCW. In this paper, a framework called CoFrame is proposed to answer the challenges faced by CSCW. Based on the emerging grid and Web service technologies, CoFrame provides some general yet flexible cooperation related services and organizes them into different layers. The elaborately designed services and architecture make CoFrame adaptive to diverse requirements of different domains. The paper details the framework and demonstrates its application with a case study in e-learning.},

  pages={6.C.4-61},
  abstract={This work focuses on the construction of an expert system shell for airborne equipment design. Traditional expert systems are constructed using a single monolithic software program for a specific application. Since the airborne equipment design is critical & complex, it demands the use of expert system technology. Since present aircrafts take in different equipments for different purposes, it is not feasible to think in terms of independently developed monolithic expert system program for each equipment. To overcome these problems, we have designed and developed a complex competent system i.e., a generic component based expert system for airborne equipment design. The main advantage of the component-based approach is that, the knowledge base is not hard coded and these components can be coupled with any domain-specific knowledge bases. The expert system with its expertise knowledge is made to guide the designer by providing design guidelines & testing procedures for the desired equipment. The expert system also audits the design and provides guidelines to modify & to improve the design.},

  abstract={Midrange and mainframe computers have a history for supporting critical business systems. As businesses have adapted to technological changes, including the emergence of the Internet and the ubiquitous connectivity offered by mobile devices, these computers have evolved to support these trends. The availability of further server and deployment options such as x86 servers, virtualization, and cloud platforms have also presented compelling alternatives for some enterprises and their business applications. The emergence of these alternatives has challenged organizations to develop sound processes when deciding where to deploy IT applications. IT applications and supporting tools are generally referred to as workloads, and their placement is often based upon budgetary constraints rather than on a combined assessment of the qualities of service aspects such as service level, performance, security, and cost. We present an approach toward a workload classifier for several compute technologies that may assist system engineers and designers in their initial decisions of where to place particular workloads. This paper is not meant to be the final word in classifying workloads, but rather a step toward classification and to stimulate debate and thinking on the subject.},

  abstract={Internal signal representation is critical for accurate perception, memory, and rapid recall in natural intelligence. In this paper we consider a model for cognitive computation that has as its base an algorithm for converting spatial signals into temporal representations. The model is motivated by vision functions but is supported by applications to concept abstraction and analogical thinking, as well as experimental comparison with the pixel intensity representation of visual images. In fact our method has demonstrated ability to defend against a well-known adversarial attack on the MNIST digits recognition. Ordinal optimization is important in achieving quickness of the algorithm.},

  volume={60},

  pages={3860-3871},
  abstract={To control an intelligent system in an unstructured environment, it is desirable to synergize human and machine intelligence to deal with changes and uncertainty cost-effectively. A shared control takes advantage of human and computer strengths in decision-making support, and this helps to improve the adaptability, agility, reliability, responsiveness, and resilience of the system. Since the decision spaces for human thinking and machine intelligence are quite different, challenges occur to fuse human intelligence and machine intelligence effectively. A brain–computer interface (BCI) can bridge human and machine intelligence; however, traditional BCIs are unidirectional that support interaction in one of two scenarios: first, human or machine takes effect at different control layers, and second, either human or machine takes effect at a time. There is an emerging need to close the loop of BCI-based control to alleviate the adverse effects of a machine's error or a human's mistake. In this article, available technologies for acquisition, processing, and mining of brain signals are reviewed, the needs of integrating human's capability to control unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are elaborated, and research challenges in advancing BCI for a shared human and machine control are discussed at the aspects of data acquisition, mapping of human's and machine's decision spaces, and the fusion of human's and machine's intelligence in automated controls. To address unsolved problems in the aforementioned aspects, we proposed a new platform of using BCI for human–machine interactions and three innovations are, first, an advanced BCI to acquire multimodal brain signals and extract features related to the intentions of motion and the quantified human's affection, second, an arbitrating mechanism in system control to determine the weight of human's decisions based on quantified human's affection, and finally, a decision support system that is capable of fusing human's and machine's decisions from different decision spaces seamlessly in controlling a UAV for real-time performance in application.},

The method invites hierarchical structure and proposes a memory-prediction framework, thus making it able to predict what will happen in the near future. This overview mainly introduces the developing process of HTM, as well as its principle, characteristics, advantages and applications in vision, image processing and robots movement, some potential applications by using HTM, such as thinking process, are also put forward.},

  abstract={We present an extension to the definition of a concept in an ontology that allows an agent to simultaneously communicate with a group of agents that might have different understandings of some concepts. We also provide a way to learn such non-unanimous concepts by using a method for learning concepts from a group of teachers. The general idea of non-unanimous concepts is to use the teachers to identify the core of a concept everyone agrees on and what else at least some of the teachers think belongs into the concept. The learning agent also decides what belongs to the concept for itself and whenever it needs to communicate with a group of other agents and needs to be precise it makes use of these three concept aspects by providing additional example objects for what might be misunderstood.},

  abstract={New generations of multi-core processors and reconfigurable hardware platforms are expected to provide a dramatic increase of processing capabilities. However, one obstacle for exploiting all the promises of such new platforms is the legacy of current applications and the development methodologies used, which is deeply rooted in a sequential way of thinking. A paradigm shift is necessary at all levels of application development to yield portable and efficient implementations, capable of exploiting the full potential of such platforms. Dataflow programming is an alternative approach that address the problem of providing portable and scalable parallel applications. Dataflow programming is able to explicitly expose the intrinsic parallelism of applications. This paper presents a hardware/software co-design methodology that starting from a unique dataflow program enables, by the direct synthesis of both hardware (HDL) and software components (C/C++), to map a signal processing application onto heterogeneous systems architectures composed by reconfigurable hardware and multi-core processors. Experimental results based on the implementation of the MPEG-4 Simple Profile decoder onto an heterogeneous platform are also provided to show the capabilities and flexibility of the approach.},

  abstract={We introduce a genetic algorithm (GA)-based method for structural optimization of multiplicative general parameter (MGP) finite impulse response (FIR) filters. These computationally efficient reduced-rank adaptive filters are robust, suitable for predictive configurations, and they have numerous applications in 50/60 Hz power systems instrumentation. The design process of such filters has three independent stages: Lagrange multipliers-based optimization of the sinusoid-predictive basis filter, genetic algorithm-based search of optimal FIR tap cross-connections and, finally, the online MGP-adaptation phase guided by variations in signal statistics. Thus, our multi-stage design procedure is a complementary fusion of hard computing (HC) and soft computing (SC) methodologies. Such advantageous fusion (or symbiosis) thinking is emerging among researchers and practicing engineers, and it can potentially lead to competitive combinations of individual HC and SC methods.},

  abstract={Can machines think? Or can they do “whatever we know how to order” them to perform? Should machines be liberated from slavery and given “fair play” to “compete with men in all purely intellectual fields”? Or should this be associated with a fashion that decries “human reason” and a path that “leads straight to Nazism”? In the postwar years, these questions were debated by Alan Turing and Douglas Hartree, who differed in their interpretations of the digital computer as a new piece of science and technology. Hartree emphasized its unprecedented calculation speed and envisioned applications in physics, logistics, energy, and warfare. Turing, who envisioned applications in biology and cognition, emphasized its potential to outperform humans intellectually, including capabilities considered distinctly human, which Hartree downplayed by mobilizing the notes of Ada Lovelace. This article examines the Turing–Hartree disputes and draws a parallel between their positions and their perspectives on postwar Britain.},

In this paper, the proposed distributed computing framework suitable for distributed spatial analysis has solved the key technical problems of distributed spatial analysis computing framework. And it is accordant with "service-oriented" thinking, takes into account the heterogeneity of spatial data sources, and the distributed spatial computing among the different systems on different platforms. The dynamic load scheduling has improved the static data partitioning method, it avoids the load imbalance problem in the phase of static data partitioning. It solved the efficiency of large-scale spatial data operations in the complex distributed environment in practical applications. At last, based on the software, we do the distributed clipping computing environment test of the classic space experiments, a detailed result has given at the last of the article, it has shown that, the framework is designed novelty, and can reduce the spatial computing time in the distributed environments extremely.},

  abstract={Mathematics has long held a prominent spot in common core competencies. Rapid advances in information and communication technology literacy have gained it recognition as an essential skill in the 21st century. Mastering both is a challenge, as is teaching them. Integration with other disciplines, addressing STEM education, makes this even more challenging. Tackling this dilemma, we adapt cooperative learning and co-teaching schemes. Hands-on class activities effectively convey an understanding of a complex model without equations. Computer simulations promote visual comprehensions for highly dynamic systems. In our course, general ecology for biologists, mathematical complexity is a crucial element required for transitioning from the real world to the world of numbers pertaining both linear and non-linear relationships. We designed indoor activities to initiate analytical thinking and to extend appreciations of outdoor experiences to abstract reasoning in numerical terms and computer models. Our approach fulfills the objectives of guiding biology students to construct scenarios reflecting complex interactions among organisms in the natural world. They overcame their primarily negative mindset, feeling intimidated by mathematics and uncomfortably unfamiliar with computer technology. To evaluate our teaching method, students were asked to qualitatively write an after action evaluation. They expressed enjoyment in their learning. Though struggling at times, the experience was very rewarding and worthwhile. Students came to a realization of the importance of mathematics and information literacy skills, while drawing appreciation and awareness from outdoor experiences. Besides, we quantitatively analyzed students' performance, which effectively serves as a guideline for adjusting our course contents for the next offering of this subject.},

  abstract={The release of WSRF showed that an OGSA infrastructure of stateful WS-Resources could be built on top of plain WSDL, while retaining Web services as stateless entities. This Grid and SOA convergence allows developers to focus on enrich descriptions with current Semantic Web services technologies (SWS), whereas WSRF and WSNotification provide the mechanisms to build stateful and distributed architectures. However, we think a direct exportation of SWS interfaces to describe WS-Resources would be of limited value, due to property changes are not properly captured with static profiles, and current WSRF lacks of semantic features. We propose a topic-based modeling of WS-Resource capabilities, along with simple WSRF and WSNotification extensions to achieve 'semantic-by-design' WS-Resource descriptions. We also illustrate how these enhancements can be applied to our Semantic Web Data Sources Integrated Architecture (DAWIS), allowing dynamic matching and discovering of Semantic WSResources.},

  abstract={It is without question that the use of digital technology (DT) has pervaded everyday life. From video chatting with a family member in another country, to checking the weather on a handheld computer, technology has provided society with many benefits. Social media, like Facebook (FB), Twitter, and LinkedIn, have seemingly brought the world closer, but at what cost? In this article, we show that the mass use of technology, more specifically social media, have led to the conscious will of users to be hijacked by platforms in order to increase their user-base and capital. We do this by first evaluating the impact of technology on one's conscious will, the feeling that one's actions are caused by oneself. After finding that technology makes users feel as though their actions are more consciously willed, and people naturally want to feel consciously willed, the next logical step is to analyze how modern tech companies use this to their advantage. Looking at features from popular social media, we describe how these features artificially increase the feeling of users' actions being consciously willed, regardless of if the users are actually consciously willing their actions. Finally, we discuss ways in which individuals can reclaim control over their conscious will, and how to reduce this commodification of will at a company level. The ability of a company to control the decision-making metrics of their users should strike one as troubling; whereas the power of a company to hypnotize its users into thinking that they are using the platform because they want to, and not because the company wants them to, is quite concerning.},

  abstract={We propose, examine prototypes of, and collect user input on morphing robotic surfaces, "robot-room" elements that, individually or in combination, change the functionality of the rooms we live in, directly controlled by the room’s occupants engaging with it. Robot-rooms represent an advance in human-robot interaction whereby human interaction is within a machine that physically envelops us. We discuss the motivation for such robot-rooms, present initial work aimed at their physical realization, and report on a user study of 80 participants to learn what people might want of and expect from robot rooms, the results of which will inform both the iterative design of the robot room and the thinking of our community as it grapples with how we want to live with (and "in") robots.},

  abstract={Intelligent and networked vehicle is a popular developing trend in future. However, Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is an import problem need to be solved. Especially, in the Vehicle Sharing System (VSS), the data authority is hard to be guaranteed based on the current technology. VSS provides the users with a convenient way to access vehicles nearby. However, the driving data security which can be used to record the driving conditions cannot be guaranteed by either cloud server or the vehicle. The camera in the cab is also not accepted because it will leak the user's privacy. This article solves this problem based on the cryptography with the public auditing technology. We design a multi-signature scheme so that the OBU and the PDA equipment of the vehicle renter can jointly sign a signature as a meta data for the driving information and upload it to the cloud server together with the raw data. In the event of a dispute, such as a vehicle accident, anyone can conduct an integrity checking with batch jobs on the stored data in the cloud server, so that the cloud and the vehicle renter cannot deny these information. We think that our scheme can be used to prevent some obvious data modification in cloud or as a part of the reference for accident identification. We also use the provable security technology to prove that our protocol is secure, and we realize its core algorithms. The experimental result shows that our scheme is efficient.},

  title={Using a polymorphic VLIW processor to improve schedulability and performance for mixed-criticality systems}, 
  year={2017},

  abstract={As embedded systems are faced with ever more demanding workloads and more tasks are being consolidated onto a smaller number of microcontrollers, system designers are faced with opposing requirements of increasing performance while retaining real-time analyzability. For example, one can think of the following performance-enhancing techniques: caches, branch prediction, out-of-order (OoO) superscalar processing, simultaneous multi-threading (SMT). Clearly, there is a need for a platform that can deliver high performance for non-critical tasks and full analyzability and predictability for critical tasks (mixed-criticality systems). In this paper, we demonstrate how a polymorphic VLIW processor can satisfy these seemingly contradicting goals by allowing a schedule to dynamically, i.e., at run-time, distribute the computing resources to one or multiple threads. The core provides full performance isolation between threads and can keep multiple task contexts in hardware (virtual processors, similar to SMT) between which it can switch with minimal penalty (a pipeline flush). In this work, we show that this dynamic platform can improve performance over current predictable processors (by a factor of 5 on average using the highest performing configuration), and provides schedulability that is on par with an earlier study that explored the concept of creating a dynamic processor based on a superscalar architecture. Furthermore, we measured a 15% improvement in schedulability over a heterogeneous multi-core platform with an equal number of datapaths. Finally, our VHDL design and tools (including compiler, simulator, libraries etc.) are available for download for the academic community.},

  abstract={We live in a digital world which controls our physical environment. The increasing use of wireless network supports these digital devices to use mostly people. People prefer mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets to personal computers or laptops. This brings that accessing to information and services is available any time and everywhere. This can be called ubiquitous computing. There is a high demand of pervasive computing applications and they have grown in the last years. However, a large group of people do not engage with these developments. This attracted the researchers to think this problem and they link it with usability of systems. In this study we reviewed 37 the articles which published on usability of ubiquitous computing. Within the scope of this study, the first stage is defining ubiquitous and usability. In the second stage, this paper organizes and classifies the literature on the area in order to facilitate future research. The review covers 37 peer-reviewed journal articles from 18 journals published between 2000 and 2014. The resulting framework summarizes the progress in usability studies on pervasive computing environments research and provides future research directions.},

  abstract={In the digital era, the interaction between people and machines is constantly changing the way of interaction between people and between people and society, making people feel the unprecedented development of science and technology. In order to systematically study the influence of human-computer interaction on automatic recognition technology of print robot, the influence of human-computer interaction on human thinking mode, behavior mode and experience demand is analyzed. Secondly, from the perspective of media and its interaction, it describes the impact of human-computer interaction on machine recognition methods from four aspects: expanding the range of spatial information through multisource data, and improving the sensory experience through multi-channel interaction. Finally, under the background of new information technology, new interaction mode, intelligent feedback and new emotional factors, the dynamic response process is improved through real-time recording and feedback. The interaction between machines can create more opportunities for the automatic recognition technology of printing robots, and expand the research direction and the development of new designs.},
