  abstract={This chapter describes how the science of dynamics was created. It considers the study of electromagnetism, and focuses on the fluid dynamics. The chapter then focuses on many creative thinkers who formulated scientific models that described the behavior of the real world. Astronomy has been one of the most persistent activities in science. Galileo Galilei's greatest contribution was to combine experimental methods with creative thinking and mathematical analysis. Isaac Newton extended the work of Galileo to replace Kepler's empirical model of the solar system by mathematical equations. In 1864 Clerk Maxwell used an equation to show that an electromagnetic wave would be propagated through space at the speed of light. The chapter considers the efforts to create a mathematical model of aerodynamics.},

  abstract={The importance of feedback on students' learning activities, so as to facilitate high learning effectiveness, has been shown before. However, the effectiveness of feedback on students' learning activities, when students learn engineering processes based on computer based simulations, is much less well known. The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of “correcting feedback” (i.e. the feedback indicates only students' mistakes) and “reflective feedback” (i.e. the feedback includes a hint to encourage the student to re-think a specific answer) on learning effectiveness of engineering students, when using computer based simulation in order to enhance the learning of engineering processes. The impact of “reflective feedback” is analyzed by carrying out semi-quasi experiments using experimental and control groups of students. It is found that “reflective feedback” does not result in higher learning effectiveness and that the students of this study prefer to correct their mistakes by focusing on “correcting feedback” and previously learned content, while using a “trial and error mentality”. The results provide evidence, first, about the impact of students' learning background when using teaching simulators, and, secondly, that simulators showing both, “correcting feedback” and “reflective feedback”, may reduce the stimulating effect of “reflective feedback” because of the presence of “correcting feedback”. Consideration of these findings will contribute to further improvement of process teaching simulators. This study is part of an ongoing research effort related to computer simulation based learning in engineering education.},

  title={LGIM: A Global Selection Algorithm Based on Local Influence for Influence Maximization in Social Networks}, 
  year={2020},
  volume={8},
  number={},
  pages={4318-4328},
  abstract={Influence maximization is to select k nodes from social networks to maximize the expected number of nodes activated by these selected nodes. Influence maximization problem plays a vital role in commercial marketing, news propagation, rumor control and public services. However, the existing algorithms for influence maximization usually tend to select one aspect from efficiency and accuracy as its main improving objective. This method of excessively pursuing one metric often leads to performing poorly in other metrics. Hence, we think that algorithms for influence maximization should make a suitable compromise between computation efficiency and result accuracy instead of excessively pursuing for one metric. Based on the above understanding, this paper proposes a new algorithm, called Global Selection Based on Local Influence (LGIM). The basic idea of the proposed algorithm is following: if a node can influence another node with large influence, the node also has large influence. Therefore, a two-stage filtering strategy of candidate nodes is proposed, which can reduce a large number of running time. Moreover, this paper also proposes a new objective function to estimate the influence spread of a node set. In summarize, the proposed algorithm utilizes the two-stage filtering strategy of candidate nodes to avoid unnecessary computation, and adopts a new objective function to replace time-consuming Monte-Carle simulations. Experimental results on six real-world social networks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other four comparison algorithms when comprehensively considering computation efficiency and result accuracy.},

Our Smart and Sustainable World vision targets prosperity for the people and the planet through better awareness and control of both human-made and natural environments. The needs of society, individuals, and industries are fulfilled with intelligent systems that sense their environment, make proactive decisions on actions advancing their goals, and perform the actions on the environment. We emphasize artificial intelligence, feedback loops, human acceptance and control, intelligent use of basic resources, performance parameters, mission-oriented interdisciplinary research, and a holistic systems view complementing the conventional analytical reductive view as a research paradigm, especially for complex problems. To serve a broad audience, we explain these concepts and list the essential literature. We suggest planning research and education by specifying, in a step-wise manner, scenarios, performance criteria, system models, research problems, and education content, resulting in common goals and a coherent project portfolio as well as education curricula. Research and education produce feedback to support evolutionary development and encourage creativity in research. Finally, we propose concrete actions for realizing this approach.},

  year={2023},

  pages={34-41},
  abstract={A software product line models the variability of highly configurable systems. Complete exploration of all valid configurations (the configuration space) is infeasible as it grows exponentially with the number of features in the worst case. In practice, few representative configurations are sampled instead, which may be used for software testing or hardware verification. Pseudo-randomness of modern computers introduces statistical bias into these samples. Quantum computing enables truly random, uniform configuration sampling based on inherently random quantum physical effects. We propose a method to encode the entire configuration space in a superposition and then measure one random sample. We show the method's uniformity over multiple samples and investigate its scale for different feature models. We discuss the possibilities and limitations of quantum computing for uniform random sampling regarding current and future quantum hardware.},

  pages={803-820},
  abstract={As the world increasingly becomes characterized by the provision of services to customers, service research faces many challenges and needs a new vision. Many of these challenges stem from the fact that technologies are continually experiencing dramatic change, and savvy customers are increasingly demanding more qualified services. Although research and experiential findings on services in many disciplines have achieved impressive results, systematic research on modern services systems is rarely considered. Aiming at services systems (not only services themselves), this paper discusses the contributions and the potentials for the field of systems theory for Services Science, Management and Engineering (SSME). Thus, SSME can provide suitable referential clues for discussing impacts of systems theory on services research, and systemic thinking can be applied to discuss key issues in SSME. Providing basic definitions of services and services systems, this paper elaborates on the research objects and methodologies of SSME from systems perspective, and proposes that systems theory can be applied as the foundations of services engineering. This paper further sheds light on systemic issues in services science and engineering, services operations, and services systems management. It also provides a summary of relevant theories and tools applied to services systems at the systems level. Finally, some potential prospects in SSME research are presented to meet research demands and practical challenges.},

We need to use more reflexively what we have learned about the nonlinear dynamical and complex nature of the brain to attempt to "bootstrap" our own thinking processes about neural science itself.},

  abstract={The Creative Computing Challenge (CCC) project (2014-2018) is funded by the National Science Foundation and is designed to broaden participation in computing by providing professional development (PD) for high school teachers at Career & Technical Education (CTE) programs throughout the state of New Hampshire. Teachers receive a stipend and tablets for their classrooms; they attend several in-person PD sessions through the year, where master teachers and PD facilitators introduce modeling of inquiry and equity-based practices, as well as teach the App Inventor tool and how to inculcate computational thinking in students. Project evaluation has included teacher interviews, classroom and PD observations, as well as student and teacher surveys. External evaluation of this project has been an integral part of the project from the beginning and, along with the project team’s observations and input, has significantly reshaped the project activities. It became clear after the first year that a central challenge of this project would be working with a mix of teachers across multiple domains – from teachers who had little experience even using computers to teachers who had computer science degrees; from teachers who came to teaching from professional backgrounds to those who had education degrees; and from beginning teachers to those who had been teaching the same courses for twenty years. Through evaluation data and really listening to teacher feedback, we not only tailored the PD content and structure, but also refined the data collection instruments and evaluation design to bridge the gap between different teacher experiences and levels of preparation. As a result, we have been able to bring computing into non-technical content areas such as Hospitality and non-programming classes such as Photography, as well as support computing educations in New Hampshire CTE programs. In Year 4, we now better understand the range of benefits and challenges involved in working with CTE programs and inserting CCC-inspired curricular modules in non-computing courses.},

  title={Tuning Convolutional Spiking Neural Network With Biologically Plausible Reward Propagation}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={33},
  number={12},
  pages={7621-7631},
  abstract={Spiking neural networks (SNNs) contain more biologically realistic structures and biologically inspired learning principles than those in standard artificial neural networks (ANNs). SNNs are considered the third generation of ANNs, powerful on the robust computation with a low computational cost. The neurons in SNNs are nondifferential, containing decayed historical states and generating event-based spikes after their states reaching the firing threshold. These dynamic characteristics of SNNs make it difficult to be directly trained with the standard backpropagation (BP), which is also considered not biologically plausible. In this article, a biologically plausible reward propagation (BRP) algorithm is proposed and applied to the SNN architecture with both spiking-convolution (with both 1-D and 2-D convolutional kernels) and full-connection layers. Unlike the standard BP that propagates error signals from postsynaptic to presynaptic neurons layer by layer, the BRP propagates target labels instead of errors directly from the output layer to all prehidden layers. This effort is more consistent with the top-down reward-guiding learning in cortical columns of the neocortex. Synaptic modifications with only local gradient differences are induced with pseudo-BP that might also be replaced with the spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). The performance of the proposed BRP-SNN is further verified on the spatial (including MNIST and Cifar-10) and temporal (including TIDigits and DvsGesture) tasks, where the SNN using BRP has reached a similar accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) BP-based SNNs and saved 50% more computational cost than ANNs. We think that the introduction of biologically plausible learning rules to the training procedure of biologically realistic SNNs will give us more hints and inspiration toward a better understanding of the biological system’s intelligent nature.},

  abstract={This manuscript presents a ring-core Bragg Fiber (RC-BF) for orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes propagation and supercontinuum generation. The proposed RC-BF is composed of alternating layers of soft glasses SF57 and LLF1 to render high nonlinearity to the fiber. Mode analysis using full-vectorial finite element method resulted in obtaining HE/EH modes to support vector modes as well as orbital angular momentum modes. The optimized fiber supports 22 OAM modes and exhibits a zero-dispersion wavelength (ZDW). The small effective area of Fiber 3 aided in achieving the highest nonlinearity,  $\gamma $  = 91.51  $\text{W}^{-1}$ km $^{-1}$ . A near-infrared supercontinuum is generated with a 35 dB flatness over a bandwidth of  $\sim $ 1087 - 2024 nm in a 20 cm long RC-BF using a chirp-free hyperbolic secant pulse of width 200 fs and peak power of 5 kW.},

  abstract={In this paper, we describe a multimodal brain-computer interface (BCI) experiment, situated in a highly immersive CAVE. A subject sitting in the virtual environment controls the main character of a virtual reality game: a penguin that slides down a snowy mountain slope. While the subject can trigger a jump action via the BCI, additional steering with a game controller as a secondary task was tested. Our experiment profits from the game as an attractive task where the subject is motivated to get a higher score with a better BCI performance. A BCI based on the so-called brain switch was applied, which allows discrete asynchronous actions. Fourteen subjects participated, of which 50% achieved the required performance to test the penguin game. Comparing the BCI performance during the training and the game showed that a transfer of skills is possible, in spite of the changes in visual complexity and task demand. Finally and most importantly, our results showed that the use of a secondary motor task, in our case the joystick control, did not deteriorate the BCI performance during the game. Through these findings, we conclude that our chosen approach is a suitable multimodal or hybrid BCI implementation, in which the user can even perform other tasks in parallel.},

  abstract={The massive amount of misinformation spreading on the internet on a daily basis has enormous negative impacts on societies. Therefore, we need systems to help fact-checkers to combat misinformation and to raise public awareness of this important problem. In this article, we propose a hybrid model which combines bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT) model with various features to prioritize claims based on their check-worthiness. Features we use include domain-specific controversial topics (CT), word embeddings (WE), part-of-speech (POS) tags, and others. In addition, we explore various ways of increasing labeled data size to effectively train the models, such as increasing positive (IncPos) samples, active learning (AL), and utilizing labeled data in other languages. In our extensive experiments, we show that our model outperforms all state-of-the-art models in test collections of Conference and Labs of Evaluation Forum (CLEF) CheckThat! Lab (CTL) 2018 and 2019. In addition, when positive samples are increased in the training set, our model achieves the best mean average precision (MAP) score reported so far for the test collection of CTL 2020. Furthermore, we show that cross-lingual training is effective for prioritizing Arabic and Turkish claims, but not for English.},

  abstract={School graduates of technology profiles classes are often seen as the most prepared potential applicants for engineering universities. Future engineers will need to apply modeling to solve problems that emerge in professional activities building on the school primary engineering learning. The construction of physical processes 3D models in computer environments can aid in the development of engineering thinking and digital training. This requires the electronic educational resources design and the development of suitable methods. The collaboration between pedagogical and engineering universities can facilitate the accomplishment of these tasks provided with methodical basis and a consolidation of the universities scientific and practical developments in the network interaction. One of the popular areas for training future engineers is distance project design where tasks are distributed among several performers. The issue of interdisciplinary design of electronic educational resources to ensure the quality of engineering training in technological profiles in schools is significant for the theory and practice of innovation in engineering education, pedagogical methodology and technology, and digital didactics. The proposed methods include computer modeling of physical processes in engineering (using materials science example), pedagogical design, and educational outcomes analysis. The paper describes the results of experimental work on organizing interdisciplinary projects for the development of electronic educational resources for school engineering learning by student teams. These teams consist of pedagogical university students, future teachers, and polytechnic university students, future engineers. It concludes that interdisciplinary training of students from pedagogical and engineering universities in the electronic educational resources design on computer modeling for school primary engineering learning is effectively feasible using distributed educational technologies. The outcome may be useful for early schoolchildren involvement in innovative engineering initiatives through participation in research projects and STEM Olympiads including multi-language educational events.},

  abstract={A Python-based lab activity was developed for a remote Thermodynamics course to add computational thinking to traditional analytical problem solving. Python was selected to conduct the analysis because of its popularity and utility in the broader engineering field. Early exposure to this highly desired engineering skill can provide added benefits to students. Combining Python with an engaging lab experience can have a compounding effect on student learning outcomes. A five-week Python-based lab module was developed for an introductory thermal-fluid science class. The module reinforced fundamental concepts learned in lecture, while expanding on design-related analysis which is often left for advanced courses. The lab module began with an introduction to Python programming and quickly transitioned to the parametric analysis of standard Rankine, Gas Turbine, and Vapor Compression cycles. The lab module was designed to be self-guided with step-by-step instructions presented using Google Colab. This paper details the implementation and the student outcomes. Both direct and indirect assessments were conducted over two semesters of the course. Results indicate a strong positive impact on Python programming learning outcomes. Students acquired a working knowledge of Python programming and experienced how computational tools can be used to solve advanced engineering problems. At the same time, the student feedback indicated students' resistance to open-ended projects and independent learning; even if they are aware of their relevance and benefits to their future careers. Nevertheless, the positive learning outcomes were encouraging. Whether students pursue a career in thermodynamics or in a broader engineering field, this lab experience equipped them with tools that can augment their engineering skills.},

First, code generators have a hard time coping with generated code size and control overhead that may spoil theoretical benefits achieved by the transformations. Second, this step is usually time consuming, hampering the integration of the polyhedral framework in production compilers or feedback-directed, iterative optimization schemes. Moreover, current code generation algorithms only cover a restrictive set of possible transformation functions. This paper discusses a general transformation framework able to deal with nonunimodular, noninvertible, nonintegral or even nonuniform functions. It presents several improvements to a state-of-the-art code generation algorithm. Two directions are explored: generated code size and code generator efficiency. Experimental evidence proves the ability of the improved method to handle real-life problems.},

  abstract={The celebrated sparse representation model has led to remarkable results in various signal processing tasks in the last decade. However, despite its initial purpose of serving as a global prior for entire signals, it has been commonly used for modeling low dimensional patches due to the computational constraints it entails when deployed with learned dictionaries. A way around this problem has been recently proposed, adopting a convolutional sparse representation model. This approach assumes that the global dictionary is a concatenation of banded circulant matrices. While several works have presented algorithmic solutions to the global pursuit problem under this new model, very few truly effective guarantees are known for the success of such methods. In this paper, we address the theoretical aspects of the convolutional sparse model providing the first meaningful answers to questions of uniqueness of solutions and success of pursuit algorithms, both greedy and convex relaxations, in ideal and noisy regimes. To this end, we generalize mathematical quantities, such as the l0 norm, mutual coherence, Spark and restricted isometry property to their counterparts in the convolutional setting, intrinsically capturing local measures of the global model. On the algorithmic side, we demonstrate how to solve the global pursuit problem by using simple local processing, thus offering a first of its kind bridge between global modeling of signals and their patch-based local treatment.},

  abstract={Brain interfaces are cyber-physical systems that aim to harvest information from the (physical) brain through sensing mechanisms, extract information about the underlying processes, and decide/actuate accordingly. Nonetheless, the brain interfaces are still in their infancy, but reaching to their maturity quickly as several initiatives are released to push forward their development (e.g., NeuraLink by Elon Musk and `typing-by-brain' by Facebook). This has motivated us to revisit the design of EEG-based non-invasive brain interfaces. Specifically, current methodologies entail a highly skilled neuro-functional approach and evidence-based a priori knowledge about specific signal features and their interpretation from a neuro-physiological point of view. Hereafter, we propose to demystify such approaches, as we propose to leverage new time-varying complex network models that equip us with a fractal dynamical characterization of the underlying processes. Subsequently, the parameters of the proposed complex network models can be explained from a system's perspective, and, consecutively, used for classification using machine learning algorithms and/or actuation laws determined using control system's theory. Besides, the proposed system identification methods and techniques have computational complexities comparable with those currently used in EEG-based brain interfaces, which enable comparable online performances. Furthermore, we foresee that the proposed models and approaches are also valid using other invasive and non-invasive technologies. Finally, we illustrate and experimentally evaluate this approach on real EEG-datasets to assess and validate the proposed methodology. The classification accuracies are high even on having less number of training samples.},

  abstract={The current technological scenario presents different mobile devices, which support wireless communication at an increasingly low cost. This all makes it possible to build systems thought to be impossible. The utilization of computational and natural elements, and the mixing of virtual and real elements, set up a complex relationship between elements. A good organization of these relations would enable the construction of complex systems that would bring countless benefits to users. This work presents an architecture to build hyper-environments, term proposed in this paper to define the interconnection between smart environments (which involve different elements, technological or not, real and/or virtual).The proposed architecture presents a taxonomy and a set of concepts for the organization of the hyper-environmental elements. It also offers directions to implement a middleware for building such systems. To validate the work, a hyper environment will be built using a middleware implemented based on the proposed architecture.},

  abstract={This paper considers the problem of joint support recovery in Multiple Measurement Vector (MMV) models. We show that by exploiting correlation priors, one can boost the performance and computational cost of unrolled data-driven techniques for joint support recovery. We propose a novel unrolling of the Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) for correlation-aware support recovery, which preserves the special "Khatri-Rao" structure that underlies the model. The proposed network, termed as "KR-LISTA", provides a parameter-efficient unrolling which enables training with limited data. Our numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of KR-LISTA at test time for different values of SNR, and support sizes which were not provided to the network during training. In addition, KR-LISTA is also seen to be effective even in presence of model uncertainties. 1},

  year={2021},
  volume={9},

  pages={97430-97443},
  abstract={Temporal sentence grounding aims to ground a query sentence into a specific segment of the video. Previous methods follow the common equally-spaced frame selection mechanism for appearance and motion modeling, which fails to consider redundant and distracting visual information. There is also no guarantee that all meaningful frames can be obtained. Moreover, this task needs to detect the location clues precisely from both spatial and temporal dimensions, but the relationship between spatial-temporal semantic information and query sentence is still unexplored in existing methods. Inspired by human thinking patterns, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine Spatial-Temporal Relationship Inference (CFSTRI) network to progressively localize fine-grained activity segments. Firstly, we present a coarse-grained crucial frame selection module, where the query-guided local difference context modeling from adjacent frames helps discriminate all the coarse boundary locations relevant to the sentence semantics, and the soft assignment vector of locally aggregated descriptors are employed to enhance the representation of selected frames. Then, we develop a fine-grained spatial-temporal relationship matching module to refine the coarse boundaries, which disentangles the spatial and temporal semantic information from query sentence to guide the excavation of visual grounding clues of corresponding dimensions. Furthermore, we devise a gated graph convolution network to incorporate the spatial-temporal semantic information by leveraging a gate operation to highlight frames referred to by the query sentence from spatial and temporal dimensions, and propagate fused information on the graph. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CFSTRI significantly outperforms most state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={Advancements in technology and computational power have significantly diversified the field of medical sciences, especially in diagnosing human cardiac disorders, which is currently one of the most severe cardiac illnesses that drastically shortens human lives. Early detection of heart failure is critical to prevent it and improve patients' survival rates. However, traditional manual methods are subject to inter examiner variability and bias, making them unreliable in diagnosing cardiac diseases. The study conducted aimed to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms in accurately identifying and classifying individuals with heart disease and those who are healthy. For this purpose, a heart disease dataset was utilized to assess the predictive capabilities of the machine learning models. The study employs nine classifiers, including Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Linear Regression (Li-R), Logistic Regression (Lo-R), and Naive Bayes (NB), before and after hyper parameter tuning. This research work also assessed various metrics, such as classification accuracy, F-measure, sensitivity, and specificity. By conducting specific preprocessing, dataset standardization, and hyper parameter tuning, it is observed that data normalization and hyper parameter adjustment of the machine learning classifiers significantly improved their performance in predicting heart disease.},

  abstract={A longitudinal study was conducted in a New Zealand secondary school to investigate the immediate and longer-term challenges and opportunities of a technology-supported learning initiative. A ‘bring your own device’ (BYOD) initiative called for a stronger connect with digital technology in formal educational settings in 2012. This was indeed much ahead of its time, as now evident from worldwide move towards digital education in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we tracked transformations within learning and teaching for over five years. At the inception of the idea, there was much resistance from parents and other stakeholders; however, the BYOD initiative ultimately showcased a very successful example of technology-supported teaching and learning initiative for other New Zealand schools. Our investigation primarily focused on one of the critical indicators for the success of such an initiative, the digital divide. The digital divide is particularly important because of the level of attention and dialogue this BYOD topic gathered across New Zealand. Initial discourses (over newspapers, radio and television) suggested that this initiative would be damaging in view of existing digital divides across societies and the overall public opinion outweighed the potential positives from such an initiative. As part of our five-year study, we investigated some of the key concerns around the digital divide issue in the context of such a technology-supported learning initiative. One of the key enablers of this study was integration of two frameworks, to enable the cross-examination of relationships between various sources of social cognitive abilities related to an individual’s information literacy, motivational and behavioral aspects. That is, how skill development, knowledge acquisition, and changes in personal and behavioral aspects impact self-efficacy levels as a consequence of BYOD strategies. The resulting framework is especially relevant in post-COVID-19 times, since technology-driven remote education delivery formats are now being touted as the new norm. Our framework will therefore provide much value to policy-makers in establishing inclusive educational policies.},
