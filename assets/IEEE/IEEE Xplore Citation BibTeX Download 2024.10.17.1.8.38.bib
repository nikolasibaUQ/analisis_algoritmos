  abstract={This research aims to analyze the Digital Social Networks (DSN) behavior, constructed from the network’s relationships, interactions, and expressions of users’ private states through collective subjectivity. For this purpose, an onion-ring system called COSSOL has been built in a case study for Twitter, following a hybrid approach to integrate Machine Learning classifiers and structural metrics from Computational Linguistics and Computational Sociology disciplines, respectively. The paper designs two experimentation scenarios divided into cases of collective subjectivity analysis for Colombia under different levels of communities’ granularity. The first case validates the system by performing a cointegration test on the metrics of each construct for the onion rings’ communities. The results show that some communities better propagate their subjective expressions against the disclosed topic when they have a higher network density and a common polarity. Moreover, the most stable communities in polarity towards a topic are those whose members are highly connected. Conversely, communities with a higher centrality index in a subset of members do not exhibit stability in collective subjectivity towards a topic disclosed in that community. The second case validates the model with a series of Social Network Analysis (SNA) metrics with a polarity layer to describe the second onion ring subcommunities and their temporal variation through community recalculation. The results show no polar distributions similar to the bimodal ones representing consensus in the values of the common Thinking Acting and Feeling (TAF) forms. In addition, general negative sentiment is identified for the ten most representative nodes of the subcommunities analyzed.},

  abstract={Case-based reasoning (CBR) is an effective reasoning technology. The core idea of CBR is using past experience and expert knowledge to solve new problems. Operation planning of helicopter mainly relies on the experiences of the decision-maker, so CBR is an effective reasoning technology which can be used in the operation planning. Two key issues, evaluation method and case adaptation, are widely focused in CBR method. However, the existing CBR is not suitable for non-numeric optimization problem such as operation planning, because it belongs to small sample size problem. To solve this problem, the comprehensive evaluation based multi-CBR (CEB-mCBR) method is proposed in this paper, which can be used for operation planning of helicopter. According to the comprehensive evaluation theory, similar historical case set of the target case is established, and the historical operation plans are ranked. On this basis, the optimum initial plan for the target case is generated by the case screening CBR model. Then the solution element screening CBR model is further put forward to solve the issue of case adaptation. The CEB-mCBR method comprises multi-CBR (case screening CBR and solution element screening CBR) and combination evaluation method. It can integrate expert experience and human thinking better, especially when solution space is limited. Finally, through a case study analysis, the multi-CBR model can generate a feasible solution for the target case, and the solution elements can be adjusted according to the situation in the actual operation, which can improve the efficiency of operation planning while keeping the safety, economy and operating efficiency.},

  pages={77737-77749},
  abstract={Project-based learning (PBL) is an active learning methodology focused on developing both soft and hard skills by solving real-world problems. In PBL, teachers act as facilitators while students take charge of their own learning. While the practice of this methodology in computing education has been growing in recent years, it still poses some challenges that need to be addressed. Integrating Scrum and Agile methodologies into PBL can be a valuable addition when teaching computing subjects to students. Therefore, this paper presents a case study of a successful implementation of PBL with Scrum, applying Agile values and principles to teach Artificial Intelligence to undergraduate students. This study contributes to the limited research on Scrum in education, as well as helps bridge the research gap in AI teaching and learning. The case study involved 30 students from an undergraduate computing program, divided into five groups, who successfully developed five different Machine Learning (ML) models to tackle the challenging real-life problem of breast cancer prediction for the Cancer Institute of the State of São Paulo. The findings of the study indicate that the students effectively utilized Scrum and Agile methodologies throughout the process and expressed satisfaction with the approach. Additionally, they developed problem-solving abilities, critical thinking and communication skills, teamwork capabilities, and gained experience in working with real-life situations and problems. The study also demonstrates that the proposed technique aligns with the foundations of the PBL approach in computing education discussed in previous literature. It serves as a valuable resource for future research on PBL implementation, by comparing similarities and differences with existing literature and discussing the strategies employed to address implementation challenges.},

  abstract={A cognition learning algorithm based on a deep belief network and inertia weight Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is presented and examined in a humanoid robot. The psychology concepts were adopted from Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. The human brain comprises two systems, System 1 and System 2. Based on their characteristics, System 1 and System 2 handle different tasks during cerebration. In this study, Deep Belief Network (DBN) is trained to construct the function of System 1 for the rapid reaction. On the other hand, PSO is applied to build System 2 for the slow and complicated brain behavior. Through the cooperation of System 1 and System 2, the proposed cognition learning algorithm can apply the psychology theories to allow the humanoid robot for learning the suitable pitching postures autonomously. In the experiments conducted in this study, the robot was trained for only five selected points and was then asked to throw precisely to nine points. The proposed algorithm provided 100% accuracy in the robot pitching game. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm was thus verified.},

  pages={118890-118906},
  abstract={Different individual features of the learner data often work as essential indicators of learning and intervention needs. This work exploits the personas in the design thinking process as the theoretical basis to analyze and cluster learners’ learning behavior patterns as groups. To adapt to the learning practice, we develop data-driven personas by clustering learners’ features based on factual learning outcomes (i.e., knowledge gain, perceived learning experience, perceived social presence) based on unsupervised learning, a more accessible and objective intervention design strategy for e-reading practices. Using the Chi-square test, we quantitatively evaluate different clusters driven by various unsupervised learning methods on the multimodal SKEP dataset. Furthermore, for a more practical real-life application, we achieved automatic persona prediction based on the attention regulation behaviors of learners. The subject-independent evaluation results indicate the best classification accuracy of 70% for the four-level classification task, differentiating three personas of learners with needs and another without feedback needs. It also shows that time-based sampling on both independent and cumulative learner behaviors works as robust predictors of learner personas, achieving a stable accuracy range of 65%-70% throughout the e-reading with the SVM classifier. Our work inspires the design of a real-time feedback loop for e-learning based on conversational agents.},

  abstract={Emotion perception similar to thinking, learning and remembering is consequent of complicated brain processes which are related to specific biological metabolism. Different human's emotional states are recognizable by measuring and interpreting of human physiological signals. Bio-sensors possess a number of advantages against other emotion recognition methods as they are relatively more consistent across cultures and nations. Emotions have a serious effect on driving. Human beings in negative and sometimes positive emotional states can be distracted which will increase the risk of driving. This paper presents an EEG-based emotion recognition system. Mutual information and magnitude squared coherence are applied to investigate the interconnectivity between 8 scalp regions. A study was performed to collect 8 channels of EEG data from 26 healthy right-handed subjects in experiencing 4 emotional states while exposed to audio-visual emotional stimuli. After feature extraction, 5-fold cross-validation was then performed using the KNN and SVM classifier. The results showed existence of different kind of functional brain connectivity in different emotional states.},

  abstract={As the Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) research field is relatively young and interdisciplinary, we spend a good deal of time and effort on communicating with each other, sharing ideas and empirical findings across disciplinary boundaries. While this practice is important and needs to continue, there is an increasingly pressing need for us to also communicate outside of this research community. I have met way too many designers, engineers, product managers, and roboticists, who tell me that they were either unaware that there was an HRI research community or that they have found our research community and have been disappointed by our work. That is unfortunate and it is fixable. Like the Human-Computer Interaction research community, we need to tackle this research-practice gap [1]. In this talk, I will make the case for why and how we might get started. There is so much to be gained by taking a Translational Science approach to HRI research. There are opportunities to do work that is grounded in real world problems, real people, and real robots. Furthermore, there are opportunities to make a difference in the design and deployment of robotic products and services right now. As just one example, in spending time studying robot deployments in service industries, at sea, and in the sky, we kept meeting professional Robot Wranglers. In many of our research projects, graduate students take on the Robot Wrangler role, which we claim will eventually disappear when the robots become “fully” autonomous. Looking across many industries, I believe that Robot Wranglers are here to stay. We could and should study them as real stakeholders and people. As HRI researchers, we have an opportunity to use our work to more directly inform the design of technologies. We can also find inspiration from the study of empirical [2]. I think it is time to roll up our sleeves and get better at communicating and working with the people who are building the future of robotics now. Publishing and presenting peer-reviewed papers is not where our work ends. We have much more work to do in translating our work in ways that will help others outside of our research community actually make use of our insights, engaging in collaborations with them, and coming back here to share and learn from stories about those experiences.},

  abstract={It is important that we analyze walking stability of physically unimpaired persons as one aspect of preventive medicine. There are many cases of unstable walking even if people think they are in good health. It is considered that if they continue to walk unstably, this may cause lower-back pain or knee pain; this burden also exerts bad influences upon other physical parts. We assessed walking stability, quantitatively, using an acceleration measurement system. Using this system, we measured the acceleration displacement at the COG of a normal walking subject and evaluated walking stability quantitatively. The center of gravity (COG) plays an important role in evaluation of stability for both standing posture and walking. By using the seasonal adjustment model it was possible to predict the periodic fluctuations observed, decomposing the original data into factors representing stability and instability. We assessed walking stability, quantitatively, using the ratio of the variance of the noise component vs. the variance of periodic component. This study provides useful information for understanding walking systems in preventive medicine and rehabilitative medicine.},

  year={2005},

  pages={141-141},
  abstract={Summary form only given. As technology advances, many human-like robots are being developed. These humanoid robots should be classified as inanimate objects; however, they share many properties with human beings. This raises the question of how infants classify them. Developmental psychology has addressed the issue of how infants come to characterize humans as agents having mental states that is indispensable foundation for sociality. Some studies suggest that infants attribute mental states only to humans. For instance, Legerstee et al. (2000) found that 6-month-old infants do expect people to communicate with people, not with objects. These results indicate that human cognition specializes in human in early infancy. Other studies have suggested, however, that infants attribute mental states to non-human objects that appear to be interactive with a person. For instance, Johnson et al. (1999) indicated that 12-month-old infants did gaze following to a non-human but interactive stuff. These results imply that interactivity between humans and objects is the key factor in mental attribution, however, interesting questions remain to be answered: do infants also have expectation for robots to communicate with person? In this study, we investigated whether 6-month-old infants expected an experimenter to talk to a humanoid robot "Robovie" [Ishiguro, et al., (2001) using infants' looking time as a measurement of violation-of-expectation. Violation-of-expectation method uses infants' property that they look longer at the event that they do not expect than at the event that they expect. During test trials, we show infants the stimulus in which an actor talks to the robot and another person. If infants regard robots as communicative existence like human, they will not be surprised and look at the robot as long as at the person. But if infants do not attribute communicational property to robots, they will look longer at the robot than at the person. To show infants how the robot behaved and interacted with people, we added a familiarization period prior to the test trials, which phase provided infants with prior knowledge about the robots. The stimuli in the familiarization of these conditions are as follows: 1) interactive robot condition: the robot behaved like a human, and the person and the robot interacted with each other; 2) non-active robot condition: the robot was stationary and the person was both active and talked to the robot; 3) active robot condition: the robot behaved like a human, and the person was stationary and silent. If the robots' appearance is dominant for expectation, the results of all condition are same. If robot' action is dominant, the results of the interactive robot condition and the active robot condition are same. And if human-robot interaction is dominant, the result of the interactive robot condition is only different. In the results, infants who had watched the interactive robot looked at the robot as long as at the person. However, infants who had previously observed other robots (non-active robot and active robot) looked longer at the robot than at the person. A previous study suggested that infants come to think of the same robot as intentional agents earlier than they can attribute simple geometric object as intentional agents (Kamewari, et al.). Therefore, it is thought that early infants have the cognitive base that specialized in appearance. Our findings, however, imply that early infants are also sensitive about external forms of human communications, such as "turn-taking" (Trevarthen, 1980), so they come to regard a non-human target as communicative by learning},

  abstract={In order to study brain function, some researchers have attempted to reverse-engineer neuronal networks and even the brain itself. This approach was based on the assumption that neurons in-vivo acted just like simple transistors in-silico. Unfortunately, both network and whole-brain modeling based on this premise have led to very little insight into actual brain function. The evidence for this claim is two-fold. First, the amount of energy needed to operate computing machinery that isn't anywhere near as complex as the human brain still requires much more energy than the latter. Second, because transistor-based computing reacts to static events whilst neurons can react to processes, properties inherent to computing architectures hardware prevent the true level of complexity and connectivity achieved in the human brain from being realized in-silico. In contrast to transistors, neurons can establish and change their connections and vary their signaling properties according to a variety of rules, allowing them to adapt to circumstances, self-assemble, auto-calibrate and store information by changing their properties according to experience (Laughlin & Sejnowski, 2003). In this speech, we elaborate on this evidence, and argue that there is a need to re-think the way we approach brain computation. In particular, we argue for a detailed understanding of neuronal function and network organization is required prior to neuronal network modeling attempt.},

  abstract={For forty years, much human electrophysiologic thinking has been based on the concept that EEG data recorded from the scalp following sensory stimulation are dominated by successive far-field correlates of bottom-up brain sensory processing, as represented in evoked potential (EP) averages. I will present evidence for an alternate view that human EEG data are dominated by oscillatory processes relating to time-varying, top-down control of cortical dynamics and attention. This view suggests a reorientation of scientific and engineering focus towards modeling brain dynamics of humans as active operators rather than as passive perceivers and programmed responders. Such research presents new engineering challenges. There is a need, first, to understand and model the process of partial phase resetting of ongoing and intermittent nonlinear oscillatory processes, and more generally, of inter-process synchronization. Methods we have developed or integrated for EEG research, including independent component analysis (ICA) and time/frequency analysis, now allow detection and modeling of such brain dynamic events from high-dimensional electrical data collected noninvasively from the human scalp. It is probable that real time signal processing capable of separating EEG processes from non-brain signals and of monitoring brain synchronization events may allow high-level cognitive monitoring that could be used in man-machine interfaces and for neuropsychological training.},

  abstract={In the Exa-scale era, one of the most important and tough problems is how to enhance the sustained performance against the limited power budget. Traditional multi-or many-core general CPUs are still popular for easy programming and porting of general applications. However, it is getting to face to the limit by semiconductor technology limit, memory capacity per core, network bandwidth, etc. GPU represents the attached accelerator solution in heterogeneous computing thanks to its high peak performance ratio to power consumption, and moreover, recent progress on AI applications such as TensorFlow ready NVIDIA GPUs. However, GPU's extremely high performance is provided by wide width of data parallel computation both in instruction level and core/thread level which requires thousands of SIMD operations simultaneously executed. Many of success stories on GPU acceleration depend on their simple parallel execution and quite low rate of exception (if statements) handling. Another problem is the interconnection network which relies on CPU-bundle high performance network such as InfiniBand. In our research team has been focusing on the FPGA computation, which is one of the hot topics of new type of accelerators for HPC, however it is quite difficult to achieve a comparable performance with GPU especially for SIMD style applications. So, we think that a new generation of accelerated computing supported by multiple heterogeneous accelerator platform including several types of ones together on computation node. The first target is a combination of GPU and FPGA to provide 360-degree solution with SIMD and pipelined parallelism depending on the characteristics of each computation part of a large application. In this talk, I will introduce the current status of our Multi-Hetero Accelerated System running on University of Tsukuba, its hardware and software development, and real application with preliminary performance evaluation.},

  abstract={The mechanical behaviors of a composite superconducting strand, which is composed of a variety of materials with different mechanical properties, are difficult to be accurately predicted using traditional mechanical methods due to the complex modeling process and difficulties in dealing with the interactions among different materials as well as material failure. In this paper, a three-dimensional equivalent discrete element model of an NbTi/Cu composite strand is established by twisting process first, and its mechanical response under external load is successfully achieved by introducing different material constitutive relations into contact models discriminatively and taking the filament fracture into consideration. This model can reduce the modeling process largely and acquire more accurate results, which can also provide a new thinking in predicting the mechanical performance of other superconducting strand or composite material.},

Entertaining such notion is so appalling that many have proposed to cut graphene into bits and pieces, thinking that size quantization effect would recover a bandgap. Unfortunately, the edges are too disordered and unzipping nanotubes simply unzips more nightmares for device integration engineers. Embracing pristine graphene with its Dirac spectrum therefore appeals as a viable technological option worth careful investigation. Such “all-graphene electronics”, in which graphene is kept pristine and lithographic patterning is performed on the electrostatic gates or substrates instead, is the subject of this talk.},

  abstract={As Internet of Things (IoT) is a fascinating paradigm in which all things and objects are connected together, it holds a significant position in fostering intelligent high-level services. However, the future IoT architecture is still under evolution profiting from the overwhelming development of cyberspace and cyber technologies. Based on the traditional physical-based IoT, social-inspired Internet of People (IoP) and brain-abstracted Internet of Thinking (IoTk), an intelligent embryo of cyber-enabled Internet of X (IoX) is being established where all things, entities, people and thinking are interacted seamlessly. In this article, we clearly introduce the cyber-enabled IoX from perspective of both ubiquitous connections and space convergence, and design an architecture with four pillars, namely, things, people, thinking and cyberentities in respective spaces. In addition, we analyze the fundamental issues in IoX development, such as information exploding, link exploding and application exploding from the view of ubiquitous connections, entity exploding and relationship exploding on the basis of space convergence, and service exploding from overall aspects, where potential solutions are discussed at the same time.

  abstract={Nowadays, with the phenomenon of the world ageing getting serious, the demand for intelligent medical treatment becomes higher than past. A series of smart bracelets have been launched for the health of the elderly, which can detect the health condition of the elderly in real-time. When an abnormal phenomenon occurs and the rescue will be needed, it can transmit the signal to the medical platform of the hospital or the mobile phone of its guardian, and then the hospital would send an ambulance and relevant doctors to rescue the patient. This paper mainly studies the starting bracelet sensors to collect data to rescue behavior of the entire process, proposes a Petri net model of distributed resource allocation based on cloud medical system. Through the structural analysis of the model and the construction of the algorithm, the rationality and efficiency of the whole system model are verified, and the case study shows that the model can effectively find the optimal scheduling path and each part of the system can respond well.},

  title={Navigating the Pitfalls: Analyzing the Behavior of LLMs as a Coding Assistant for Computer Science Students—A Systematic Review of the Literature}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={12},

  pages={112605-112625},
  abstract={In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have been employed significantly in different domains of computing education. Nevertheless, these models have been focused on essential adherence to their integration as coding assistants in computing education. However, attention has been switched to thoroughly examining and analyzing LLM behavior, particularly in computing education for programming tasks such as code generation, code explanation, and programming error message explanation. Therefore, it becomes imperative to understand their behavior to examine potential pitfalls. This article addresses this gap systematically and details how different LLM-based coding chatbots, such as ChatGPT, Codex, Copilot, and others, react to various coding inputs within computing education. To achieve this objective, we collected and analyzed articles from 2021 to 2024, and 72 studies were thoroughly examined. These objectives include investigating the existing limitations and challenges associated with utilizing these systems for coding tasks, assessing their responses to prompts containing coding syntax, examining the impact of their output on student learning, and evaluating their performance as debugging tools. The findings of this review highlight that it is premature to incorporate these systems into computing education due to their limitations that may limit their effectiveness as comprehensive coding assistants for computer science students. These limitations include issues with handling prompts containing code snippets, potential negative impacts on student learning, limited debugging capabilities, and other ineffectiveness. The finding also reports multiple research directions that can be considered in future research related to LLMs in computing education.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) is considered to be the fourth industrial revolution. Artificial Intelligence with the help of big data has transformed all industries around the world Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human or animal intelligence in computational systems so that they are programmed to think like Intelligent beings and mimic the actions of intelligent entities. Computational systems which have programmed intelligence can solve different real-world problems far more accurately and efficiently than computational systems that are deterministic and hardcoded. Since many problems in business and business analytics cannot be solved by deterministic systems, AI plays a major role in tackling problems in the business world Machine learning and deep learning which are subsets of the field of AI is widely used to solve and optimize many problems in business such as marketing, credit card fraud detection, algorithmic trading, customer service, portfolio management, product recommendation according to the needs of customers, insurance underwriting. AI and big data have revolutionized the business world and this paper discusses some AI and big data technologies that are currently being used to accelerate business growth.},

  abstract={This paper presents a panel summary on the framework of Autonomous Systems (AS) and paradigms in development. AS are advanced intelligent systems and general AI technologies triggered by the transdisciplinary development in intelligence science, system science, brain science, cognitive science, robotics, computational intelligence, and intelligent mathematics. It is recognized that, in a rigorous perspective, the only matured AS is human brains and human collective intelligence. It explains why there was rarely man-made AS in the past half century, because of the theoretical, mathematical, computational, and programming language unreadiness. Therefore, the ultimate goal of AS is to implement a brain-inspired system that may think and behave as a human counterpart in hybrid intelligent systems and general AI implementations. There is no doubt that AS will be increasingly demanded by the intelligence-based industries and societies for cognitive computers, deep machine learning systems, robotics, brain-inspired systems, mission-critical systems, self-driving vehicles, and intelligent appliances.},

  abstract={This paper presents the conceptualization proposed by Ignacio Matte Blanco of the functioning of conscious and unconscious thinking. In his original view the two ways of thinking are conceived as two distinct logics, “symmetrical” and “asymmetrical” logics. In this study the fundamentals of his concepts are identified and re-elaborated in a more formal way, with the aim of developing an operational and dynamic functional structure that evolves over time and that includes the affective value of objects. On this basis a computational implementation of the conscious-unconscious interaction that employs Learning Classifier Systems (LCS) is put forward. The reason for this choice is that LCS have a structural affinity with the proposed ideas, and in particular they allow to model directly the psychodynamic concept of “internal reality”.},

  abstract={Emotion recognition involves accurately interpreting human emotions from various sources and modalities, including questionnaires, verbal, and physiological signals. With its broad applications in affective computing, computational creativity, human-robot interactions, and market research, the field has seen a surge in interest in recent years. This paper presents a systematic review of multimodal emotion recognition (MER) techniques developed from 2014 to 2024, encompassing verbal, physiological signals, facial, body gesture, and speech as well as emerging methods like sketches emotion recognition. The review explores various emotion models, distinguishing between emotions, feelings, sentiments, and moods, along with human emotional expression, categorized in both artistic and non-verbal ways. It also discusses the background of automated emotion recognition systems and introduces seven criteria for evaluating modalities alongside a current state analysis of MER, drawn from the human-centric perspective of this field. By selecting the PRISMA guidelines and carefully analyzing 45 selected articles, this review provides comprehensive perspectives into existing studies, datasets, technical approaches, identified gaps, and future directions in MER. It also highlights existing challenges and current applications of the MER.},

  pages={167-171},
  abstract={This paper proposes a flexible three-dimensional (3D) scanning system based on an active stereo scanner mounted on a six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) industrial robot arm. In addition, we reduce the blind area of sensors by adding one more DOF to adjust the convergent angle of the two cameras. This configuration is suitable for scanning items with different sizes, complex shapes, and sophisticated structures due to the flexibility in approaching the object. Then, the research develops a robot-based iterative closest point method for point cloud registration. This 3D reconstruction strategy enhances the accuracy as well as the computational time of the point cloud processing. After that, we conduct several real-world experiments to examine the effectiveness of the proposed system and algorithm.},

  abstract={A graphics environment for essentially real-time interactive scientific visualization of computational fluid mechanics is described. A researcher can interactively examine fluid data on a frame buffer with animated flow visualization diagnostics that mimic those in the experimental laboratory. This provides an effective and interactive way to analyze the underlying physical mechanisms and to compare results with laboratory experiment. The system is implemented on a data parallel supercomputer attached to a frame buffer. The fluid diagnostic tools include display of moving color contours for scalar fields, smoke/dye injection of passive particles to identify coherent flow structures, and bubble wire tracers for velocity profiles. The system is demonstrated by analyzing data generated from a numerical simulation of laminar and turbulent flow over a backwards-facing step. Input parameters are menu-driven, and images are updated at nine frame updates/s.<>},
