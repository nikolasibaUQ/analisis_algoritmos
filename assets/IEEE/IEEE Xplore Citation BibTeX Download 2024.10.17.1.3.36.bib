  abstract={The Covid-19 pandemic has been linked with significant deterioration of neuro-cognitive health. The forced abnormal isolation mandated by the lockdown has been associated with increased internal stressors, leading to early onset of mental health degeneration. The current challenge for the medical practitioners is to identify tools to help slow down such neurocognitive decline. In this project, we develop a model of sentiment manipulation using linguistic cues that can regulate the affective-motivational state of an individual to reduce triggers of neurocognitive degeneration. Based on the model insights, we build a user-friendly, low-cost Web App, customizable in many languages, to identify and score the primary sentiment of any audio or text to help reduce exposure to content that can potentially trigger internal stressors. In a randomized control experiment with 160 subjects, we find that participants in our target group who consumed content with positive or upbeat cues over a period of 60 days were 3.68 times less likely to report loneliness, 2.1 times less likely to report depressive thoughts and emotions and 1.75 times less likely to report forgetfulness than our control group, providing promising evidence of the potential of positive linguistic cues to prevent or slow down neuro-cognitive degeneration.},

  abstract={This paper proposes an architecture for developmental robot that can learn abstract concepts early on and use these concepts to reason and make decisions. We introduce a frame work of two macro-layers. The bottom layer takes the desired information (e.g., desired heading direction) as the input. The top macro-layer enables human teachers to interactively inject a representation of abstract concepts (e.g., location) into the developmental process. This architecture is applied to a navigation problem, and its superiority over one-layer architecture is confirmed in comparative experiments using simulated Lidar sensor data. The robotic navigation demonstrates its robustness in accomplishing complicated task in clutter outdoor environments.},

  abstract={Pet robots, a sub-class of robotic companions, have garnered the interest of the scientific community and the public recently, due to their potential to help humans with everyday activities and enhance the psychological well-being of individuals across various aspects, for example, they can either serve as mere products of entertainment or as an alternative solution to mental healthcare. However, challenges must be solved when developing and crafting a pet robot that can adapt to the mentioned uses. A significant problem is that pet robots must bring their owners the experience that is close to having a real pet, both physically and psychologically. Therefore, there are specific requirements for the robot design and the variety of robot behaviors to make the robot as friendly and interactive as possible. This research aims to develop a versatile companion pet robot suitable for individuals of all ages, featuring a user-friendly design and high-end functionalities. The robot can move around and is equipped with basic functionalities such as voice recognition, emotional expressions, etc. Additionally, the robot integrated an advanced feature of autonomous thought processing, enabling it to generate responses and interact more dynamically and intuitively with its users.},

  year={2010},
  volume={},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Motivated learning is a new machine learning approach that extends reinforcement learning idea to dynamically changing, and highly structured environments. In this approach a machine is capable of defining its own objectives and learns to satisfy them though an internal reward system. The machine is forced to explore the environment in response to externally applied negative (pain) signals that it must minimize. In doing so, it discovers relationships between objects observed through its sensory inputs and actions it performs on the observed objects. Observed concepts are not predefined but are emerging as a result of successful operations. For the optimum development of concepts and related skills, the machine operates in the protective environment that gradually increases its complexity. Simulation illustrates the advantage of this gradual increase in environment complexity for machine development. Comparison to reinforcement learning indicates weakness of the later method in learning proper behavior, even in such protective environments with gradually increasing complexity. The method shows how mental development stimulates learning of new concepts and at the same time benefits from this learning. Thus the method addresses a well know problem of merging connectionist (bottom-up) and symbolic (top down) approaches for intelligent autonomous machine operation in developmental robotics.},

  volume={7},
  number={},
  pages={1-7},
  abstract={Sri Lanka has taken the initiative through its new education reforms to introduce Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a compulsory content in the ICT curriculum of lower secondary education from 2025. This national task focused on applying a more appropriate pedagogical approach to make a relatively complex subject like AI easier for students to understand. When the literature is examined, it is seen that different teaching approaches were used to teach AI worldwide, and authentic learning has been considered the most appropriate method. This study was conducted to assess the applicability of the learning module, which has been developed based on authentic learning techniques to teach AI to grade six school children in Sri Lanka. A qualitative study was conducted among six ICT school teachers who engage in teaching for lower secondary grades. Participants were selected purposefully to gather more important views on the research question. Key informants’ interviews were conducted using a qualitative guide, and all interviews were audio recorded following informed consent. All recordings were reviewed, and important areas were identified. Results revealed that our module provides more opportunities for the students to learn AI with their real-life experiences, moves students from passive receivers of information to active participants in their own discovery process, increases their motivation and retention to learn AI and helps to improve 21stcentury skills, i.e., learning skills, literacy skills and life skills, of the learners. The analysis of the results provided strong evidence to conclude that the developed learning module will be useful in teaching AI to grade six school children in Sri Lanka using an authentic learning approach. Similarly, it will enhance the knowledge and skills of students related to AI in a more sustainable manner to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century and the 4th industrial revolution.},

  abstract={Software development has undergone a paradigm change with the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into DevOps processes. This study examines the complex effects of AI on every stage of the software development lifecycle, from the creation of the code to its deployment and use. Through the viewpoint of “The Intelligent Evolution of Coding,” we explore how productivity benefits, traditional coding habits are being reshaped, and software is being strengthened against security risks thanks to AI-driven code creation and analysis. After that, the story switches to the revolutionary trip “From CI/CD to Autonomous Pipelines,” explaining how AI is streamlining software releases, improving pipelines for continuous integration and deployment, and encouraging development and operations teams to work together more effectively. The paper highlights the symbiotic connection that characterizes the future of software development by emphasizing the dynamic partnership between human knowledge and machine intelligence throughout this research. To fully realize the promise of AI-driven DevOps, businesses must negotiate this disruptive environment with careful attention to ethical implementation, workforce upskilling, and the development of learning ecosystems.

  abstract={This work proposes a transformer-based model capable of generating music in its symbolic domain, in a controllable fashion. The ultimate goal of this is to build a system with which people can compose music collaboratively with a computer. Using an NLP model as a base (GPT-2), we take advantage of the similarities across symbolic music representation and written language to build a model capable of conditionally predicting musical sequences. Controllability is achieved without explicit programming for it, and does not require extensive retraining of the model. A study with 939 participants was performed to evaluate this controllability. The results of this suggest the proposed method is indeed effective and can be used to control the generation of music in its symbolic domain. The method itself is flexible to any desired “control”, but this work focuses specifically on the emotion conveyed when one listens to a piece of music.},

  year={2022},
  volume={10},

  pages={125679-125695},
  abstract={Music generation using deep learning has received considerable attention in recent years. Researchers have developed various generative models capable of imitating musical conventions, comprehending the musical corpora, and generating new samples based on the learning outcome. Although the samples generated by these models are persuasive, they often lack musical structure and creativity. For instance, a vanilla end-to-end approach, which deals with all levels of music representation at once, does not offer human-level control and interaction during the learning process, leading to constrained results. Indeed, music creation is a recurrent process that follows some principles by a musician, where various musical features are reused or adapted. On the other hand, a musical piece adheres to a musical style, breaking down into precise concepts of timbre style, performance style, composition style, and the coherency between these aspects. Here, we study and analyze the current advances in music generation using deep learning models through different criteria. We discuss the shortcomings and limitations of these models regarding interactivity and adaptability. Finally, we draw the potential future research direction addressing multi-agent systems and reinforcement learning algorithms to alleviate these shortcomings and limitations.},

  year={2023},
  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={56634-56648},
  abstract={Even without hearing or seeing individuals, humans are able to determine subtle emotions from a range of indicators and surroundings. However, existing research on emotion recognition is mostly focused on recognizing the emotions of speakers across complete modalities. In real-world situations, emotion reasoning is an interesting field for inferring human emotions from a person’s surroundings when neither the face nor voice can be observed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal approach for predicting emotion from missing one or more modalities based on attention mechanisms. Specifically, we employ self-attention for each unimodal representation to extract the dominant features and utilize the compounded paired-modality attention (CPMA) among sets of modalities to identify the context of the considered individual, such as the interplay of modalities, and capture people’s interactions in the video. The proposed model is trained on the Multimodal Emotion Reasoning (MEmoR) dataset, which includes multimedia inputs such as visual, audio, text, and personality. The proposed model achieves a weighted F1-score of 50.63% for the primary emotion group and 42.7% for the fine-grained one. According to the results, our proposed model outperforms the conventional approaches in terms of emotion reasoning.},

  volume={12},

  pages={2660-2673},
  abstract={Recently, various text-to-image generative models have been released, demonstrating their ability to generate high-quality synthesized images from text prompts. Despite these advancements, determining the appropriate text prompts to obtain desired images remains challenging. The quality of the synthesized images heavily depends on the user input, making it difficult to achieve consistent and satisfactory results. This limitation has sparked the need for an effective prompt optimization method to generate optimized text prompts automatically for text-to-image generative models. Thus, this study proposes a prompt optimization method that uses in-context few-shot learning in a pretrained language model. The proposed approach aims to generate optimized text prompts to guide the image synthesis process by leveraging the available contextual information in a few text examples. The results revealed that synthesized images using the proposed prompt optimization method achieved a higher performance, at 18% on average, based on an evaluation metric that measures the similarity between the generated images and prompts for generation. The significance of this research lies in its potential to provide a more efficient and automated approach to obtaining high-quality synthesized images. The findings indicate that prompt optimization may offer a promising pathway for text-to-image generative models.},

  year={2012},
  volume={40},
  number={10},
  pages={2408-2415},
  abstract={The effects of soil dry density and water content are being examined through experimental time-domain-reflectometry (TDR) and frequency-domain reflectometry (FDR) methods in correlation with electromagnetic simulations. The infiltration rate (hydraulic conductivity) of water in sand is exceptionally high, resulting in heterogeneous moisture distribution through the soil. The effective dielectric constant of the soil/water/air mixture is dependent on the soil's dry density and moisture content. Both TDR and FDR methods are performed on a coaxial transmission line filled with a soil/water/air mixture. The flow of the water through the soil creates a dynamic situation in which the soil/water/air electrical impedance changes over time. The resulting soil has heterogeneous water content, creating varying electrical impedance values along the length of the coaxial line. The soil compaction, i.e., dense or loose, has significant impact on the heterogeneity of the moisture content through the soil and the dry density of the soil. In each case, the effective dielectric constant is determined from the data collected from TDR and FDR experiments, and the values are compared with the predictions using established empirical models by Topp, Hilhorst, and Hendrickx. With the exception of the data represented as a function of the degree of saturation, the Hendrickx model appears to best represent the measured dielectric constants since it falls within two standard deviations of the measured data. A computer simulation technology (CST) Microwave Studio is used to supplement experimental observations of various soil moisture contents in a coaxial cell. Simulations confirm that the change in the dielectric constant through the soil is a result of the heterogeneous moisture distribution. It was found that the soil moisture content has a major impact on the resulting dielectric constant from measurements or modeling. In the coaxial-cell device, soil moisture migration during the testing period results in a heterogeneous moisture regime and a temporal dielectric constant. This is particularly exaggerated for high-hydraulic-conductivity soils such as sand.},

  abstract={The article presents a method for implementation of "anytime" algorithms into digital real-time control system for a small turbojet engine iSTC-21v. This method presents an approach that will be used for future work in design of the control system. The presented method is an extension of the actual developed control system of engine, which uses the theory of situational control of complex systems. This control system uses progressive control algorithms. For practical implementation of this control system it is important to think about computational complexity. Control systems of aircraft engines use computer (Full Authority Electronic engine control — FADEC) with limited computation resources. Aircraft engines work in environment with stochastic conditions. It is necessary to ensure reliable and stable operation of engine. Anytime algorithms can help to solve this problem and to meet the safety requirements.},

  abstract={The application of wide-band gap semiconductors and their integration with other power electronics components (e.g., passives, gate drivers, sensing, thermal management) can meet the growing demand for volume reduction in power electronics systems. The design of such an integrated system is a complex multiphysics problem given the high number of variables to identify, objectives to optimize, and constraints to satisfy. Traditionally, this complex problem is approached subdividing the design in different steps, where in each step, the single components are designed and optimized independently from the others. This might clearly overlook the effect that the design choices of a single subsystem has on other subsystems, leading to suboptimal solutions. In this article, an automated design approach is proposed with the aim of maximizing power density whilst minimizing total losses. As a vessel to investigate the presented optimization workflow, the magnetically coupled interleaved H-bridge topology is chosen as an emblematic example of multivariable design problem. The first step of this approach consists of developing a loss model of the converter, which takes into account components physical dimensions, the temperature dependence, and the circuit parasitics. In the second step, these models are used within a nested optimization procedure in order to estimate the losses for multiple points of load. With the aim of validating both design approach and optimization results, three different optimal solutions have been deeply analyzed with commercial suit, prototyped, and tested. The showed experimental results endorse the adopted design approach confirming the optimality/validity of the manufactured solutions.},

  abstract={In this paper, a checking system for eye lotion instillations of ophthalmology patients is proposed, using a neural network. It first estimates tilt angles of the eye dropper bottle from acceleration values measured by a triaxial sensor. A sequence of such estimated values is next presented to a discrimination model after network learning, and its output value is considered to be a certainty degree indicating whether an eye lotion is applied at the time zone corresponding to the sequence. The final judgement for the instillation is made by conducting thresholding of the certainty degree. The proposed method employs either a long short-term memory (LSTM for short) or a bidirectional long short-term memory (B_LSTM for short) to construct the discrimination model. Experimental results using practical data reveal that the B_LSTM-based model achieves favorable metric values compared to the LSTM-based model. In addition, it is explored whether the metric values depend on the interval between the time points when the tilt values are measured.},

  abstract={Network Exchange Objects (NEO) is a new software framework designed to facilitate development of complex natural or built distributed system models, where the system model is represented as a graph, through which currencies (e.g., coding information) flux. This paper introduces "system-level hypothesis (SLH) testing" as a form of computational thinking that will drive integration of computational and empirical sciences to promote efficient, self- correcting inquiry into the operations and behavior of complex systems. To demonstrate NEO, we examine the problem of maximizing the productivity of a software development organization by measuring growth in the total lines of code (LOC) contributed by developers. We develop a software framework (NEO) that allows rapid creation of model variants representing alternative SLHs. NEO is designed to investigate systems we describe as "complex adaptive hierarchical networks" (CAHNs - complex systems represented as networks that route and store multiple interactive currencies). Models built atop NEO, are organized collections of individual values (model variables) and algorithms (model logic). Modelers systematically combine algorithms to create alternative model formulations at runtime. Thus, NEO is a simulation framework that can be used in any domain of expertise, where systems are represented as interdependent entities that store and flux multiple currencies.},
