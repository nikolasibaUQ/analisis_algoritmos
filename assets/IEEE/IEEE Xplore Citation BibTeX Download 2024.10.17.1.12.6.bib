  abstract={The three-way decision theory provides a three-way philosophical thinking to solve problems, and the regret theory quantifies the risk preferences of decision makers under different psychological behaviors. On the one hand, the combination of these two theories makes models more practical by considering the psychological behaviors of decision makers. On the other hand, we can effectively combine the advantages of the three-way decision theory with the regret theory to highlight the interpretability of decision-making processes. In this article, we propose a novel approximate estimation method for incomplete utility values via the regret theory and establish a wide sense of a three-way decision model on incomplete multiscale decision information systems. First, the degree of consistency for each scale is measured via using the dependence degree, then the optimal subsystem is selected by evaluating the scale selection cost. Furthermore, the incomplete multiscale evaluation information is transformed into triangular fuzzy numbers via linguistic term sets. Second, in light of fuzzy evaluation values and tradeoff factors, an estimation method for incomplete fuzzy subsystems is constructed, which can be used to calculate the utility difference and regret-rejoicing values for pairwise comparisons. Finally, from the perspective of human cognition, the tripartition and the corresponding decision rules are built by the tolerance degree, and the ranking of objects is calculated by the relative closeness degree. Additionally, multiaspect comparative and experimental analyses are performed by extensive experiments, and the feasibility, validity, and stability of the constructed model are shown by parametric analyses.},

  abstract={In the present analytic thinking, we have modeled the governing equations of a two dimensional peristaltic transport of a Hyperbolic tangent nanofluid in the presence of a heat source/sink with the combined effects of thermal radiation and inclined magnetic field in a tapered asymmetric channel. The propagation of waves on the non-uniform walls to have different amplitudes and phase but the same wave speed is produced the tapered asymmetric channel. The equations of dimensionless temperature and nanoparticle concentration are solved analytically under assumptions of long wavelength and low Reynolds number. The governing equations of momentum of a hyperbolic tangent nanofluid for the tapered asymmetric channel have also been solved analytically using the regular perturbation method. The expression for average rise in pressure has been figured using numerical integrations. The effects of various physical parameters entering into the problem are discussed numerically and graphically. The phenomenon of trapping is also investigated. Furthermore, the received results show that the maximum pressure rise gets increased in case of non-Newtonian fluid when equated with Newtonian fluid.},

  title={A Genetic Fuzzy Linguistic Combination Method for Fuzzy Rule-Based Multiclassifiers}, 
  year={2013},
  volume={21},
  number={5},
  pages={950-965},
  abstract={Fuzzy set theory has been widely and successfully used as a mathematical tool to combine the outputs provided by the individual classifiers in a multiclassification system by means of a fuzzy aggregation operator. However, to the best of our knowledge, no fuzzy combination method has been proposed, which is composed of a fuzzy rule-based system. We think this can be a very promising research line as it allows us to benefit from the key advantage of fuzzy systems, i.e., their interpretability. By using a fuzzy linguistic rule-based classification system as a combination method, the resulting classifier ensemble would show a hierarchical structure, and the operation of the latter component would be transparent to the user. Moreover, for the specific case of fuzzy multiclassification systems, the new approach could also become a smart way to allow standard fuzzy classifiers to deal with high-dimensional problems, avoiding the curse of dimensionality, as the chance to perform classifier selection at class level is also incorporated, into the method. We conduct comprehensive experiments considering 20 UCI datasets with different dimensionality, where our approach improves or at least maintains accuracy, while reducing complexity of the system, and provides some interpretability insight into the multiclassification system reasoning mechanism. The results obtained show that this approach is able to compete with the state-of-the-art multiclassification system selection and fusion methods in terms of accuracy, thus providing a good interpretability-accuracy tradeoff.},

  title={Fuzzy Markov Decision-Making Model for Interference Effects}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={31},
  number={1},
  pages={199-212},
  abstract={The law of total probability plays an essential role in Bayesian reasoning, which has been used in many fields. However, some experiments show the law of total probability can be violated. In recent years, researchers have tried to explain this paradox with the interference effect in quantum theory, and they think the main reason for interference effects is the uncertain information in the decision-making process. Therefore, how to effectively model and process the uncertain information in the decision-making process is very important to understand and predict the interference effects. Zadeh proposed the fuzzy set by considering the fuzziness of information. Later, Atanassov proposed the intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFS). IFS better describes the fuzzy information from the view of membership, nonmembership than fuzzy sets, which can also more flexibly simulate human decision making. Hence, the article proposed the fuzzy Markov decision-making model (FDM) under the framework of IFS to explain and predict the interference effects of decision-making process. In FDM, intuitionistic fuzzy number can be generated by using the negation operation of probability. In addition, the transition matrix can be obtained by using the Kolmogorov equation, which can consider the evolution time in the decision-making process. The transition matrix establishes the relationship between different stages to get the fuzzy numbers of final states. Finally, the article used the Dempster–Shafer evidence theory to transform fuzzy number into the probability. In summary, the proposed FDM can provide a novel idea to explore and explain the interference effects in the decision-making process, which is helpful to promote the development of artificial intelligence.},

  abstract={In standard situations, agents in a multi-agent community need to communicate each other to accomplish cooperation and coordination of joint activities. Normally it is expected that each agent can contact any other using a reliable communication infrastructure. Often one has to think about situations when a communication subsystem becomes disintegrated and some agents become isolated from the rest of the community. The paper provides basic analysis of such inaccessibility situations, and reviews possible technologies to remedy the resulting difficulties. The concepts of a so-called doubler agent and stand-in agent for maintaining agents accessibility is introduced. A brief discussion on suitability of the acquaintance models for maintaining accessibility on a symbolic level is also touched.},

  abstract={The existing fuzzy multiattribute decision making methods rely too much on discrete information fusion operators. In the context of big data, it cannot meet the needs of rapid fusion of massive data, nor can it reflect the continuous change of decision-makers thinking over time. In this article, we study how to integrate large-scare continuous hesitant fuzzy information more efficiently. We define the concepts of continuous hesitant fuzzy sets and continuous hesitant fuzzy functions. Based on these, we further explore definite line integrals of continuous hesitant fuzzy functions and their related properties. Two continuous hesitant fuzzy information integration models based on the hesitant fuzzy calculus are proposed. We also commit to revealing the internal connections between the first line integral model, the second line integral model, and the hesitant fuzzy weighted operator. We state why it is necessary to introduce novel aggregation models based on definite line integrals, and then provide applications of the proposed models to prove their validity and rationality. Finally, we compare the proposed models with other aggregation operators to further demonstrate their effectiveness and rationality.},

  title={FPGA-Based Fuzzy Logic Controllers Applied to the MPPT of PV Panels—A Systematic Review}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={32},
  number={8},
  pages={4260-4269},
  abstract={Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is a technique for continuously extracting the largest amount of energy that a source can provide under varying conditions, and it is indispensable for modern photovoltaic (PV) panels. Among several methods to achieve this, fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) have been a popular choice over the years, incorporating human-like thinking into their design to promote flexibility, robustness, and reliability. In addition, due to its high performance, low power consumption, and high circuit density, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) may be a suitable choice for implementing these controllers. This study aims to identify the applicability of FPGA-based FLCs for the MPPT of PV panels. A systematic literature review was conducted, focusing on five research questions. The methods proposed in the 14 selected studies were analyzed in terms of their advantages and limitations. Results demonstrate that FLCs are remarkably adequate for MPPT, although they are preferred when used in conjunction with other techniques. By employing FPGAs, fuzzy controllers may achieve significantly faster responses at an overall lower cost. However, this comes with increased complexity and resource usage. The findings highlight the suitability while acknowledging the limitations of FLCs and FPGAs for the MPPT in PV panels. Moreover, some aspects still require further research, such as methods for dealing with partial shading conditions, the analysis of modern techniques not yet explored in FPGAs, and the integration of FPGA-based technologies in large-scale grids.},

  year={2024},

  pages={3508-3520},
  abstract={Social networks are gaining importance as an important application landscape for machine learning techniques. Currently, it is prevalent thinking to introduce social networks into group decision-making research, despite exhibiting promising performance, there remain significant challenges, including 1) trust risk is often overlooked, and 2) group opinions are excessively relied upon. In this regard, this article introduces the trust risk test for group consensus (SN-TRT-GC) by using probabilistic linguistic preference relations under probabilistic linguistic term sets. The proposed method ensures that the expert's competence matches the discourse as much as possible by virtue of the trust risk value. Moreover, opinion evolution relies on the dual attributes of similarity and trust, which promote the exchange of opinions among experts and greatly accelerate the consensus reaching process. Empirical investigations of satisfaction surveys demonstrate the validity and superiority of the presented SN-TRT-GC technique.},

  abstract={Normalized cut based image segmentation has a variety of applications in the area of image compression, medical imaging, mapping and measurements. But, the computational complexity of conventional normalized cut algorithm based on generalized eigenvalue problem is high. In this study, we proposed a simplified normalized cut algorithm using graph partitioning method for image segmentation. The computational cost of this simplified method are relatively low and hence, it can be implemented on real time embedded system applications. We have implemented an FPGA based image segmentation system using the simplified normalized cut algorithm and tested it for malarial parasites detection. Verilog Hardware Description Language (Verilog HDL) is used to develop the system and implemented on FPGA Spartan-6 targeted device xc6slx16- 2csg324. The Simple-As-Possible (SAP) computer architecture is used to design the system. We think the proposed architecture can be useful for real time image segmentation.},

  abstract={An approximate parallel prefix adder is a type of circuit that can perform addition operations on binary numbers with extremely high speed, low latency, and much less power. Nowadays, thinking about fuzzy computing, that is, sacrificing computational expectations for computational efforts, has emerged as a promising graphical approach. Over the past decade, various research works have explored approximate computation at both the software level and the hardware abstraction level, with encouraging results. At the stage of hardware abstraction, adders (which are the most widely used and mandatory information operators in digital systems) have generated great interest in the approximation used in digital systems used in image processing applications. The approximate Brent-Kung adder (AxBK) is a variant of the simple Brent-Kung adder that introduces a degree of approximation into its operation. A new approximate BK adder is proposed with high-speed overall performance and low error cost. Its BK adder and AxBK adder are restricted to bits 8,16,32 using software called Xilinx Vivado and MATLAB.},

  abstract={Two principle concerns prompt some theorists to link quantum mechanics and theories of mind or theories of consciousness. On the one hand, it is commonly thought that conscious minds play some important role in processes of quantum measurement and that any good theory of mind ought to explain how a mind can play such a role. On the other hand, a few people think that the framework of classical physics is not, by itself, sufficiently powerful to explain the myriad remarkable properties of minds and that a good explanation must rely on some special features of quantum mechanics. Usually, these features include either state vector reduction-the collapse of the wave function-or special capabilities, often computational or super-computational ones, allegedly displayed by physical substrates while existing in hypothesised coherent states of linear superposition. Two questions summarise the author's misgivings about both the above motivations for linking quantum mechanics and theories of mind. First, does the process of quantum measurement really require a conscious observer? Second, does quantum mechanics underwrite any special effects in, say, intraneuronal protein lattices, which could play a role in instantiating consciousness in biological systems? It turns out that the particular character of the negative answer suggested for the first question also prompts a negative answer for the second. He summarises these negative answers after describing briefly some popular attempts to forge quantum theories of mind.},

  abstract={Robotics and computational thought are ideal tools for developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. Throughout this paper a modular and adaptive course is presented, the main objective of which is to make known simple and economic tools of educational robotics. This course is aimed at those who want to discover the possibilities of educational robotics in the context of the introduction to robotics. Today, robotics training tools are raised with the aim of promoting innovation and motivation of students during the learning process. Robots are becoming more and more common in our daily lives; therefore, it is important to integrate robots into all levels of our society. The course is designed to work with the Scratch, Crumble and Arduino tools as STEM enhancers. Using Scratch, interactive stories, games and animations can be programmed. Scratch helps young people to acquire and improve skills such as think creatively, think systematically, and work collaboratively. Scratch is a project of MIT Media Lab's Lifelong Kindergarten Group. It is offered free of charge. On the other hand, Crumble is an easy-to-use programmable controller. Its programming interface uses a block programming language based on Scratch that makes it easy for children from 10 years old to use it. In addition, the hardware elements associated with Crumble are very intuitive and easy to connect. Last, but not least, Arduino is an open source electronic platform based on hardware and software that is easy to use. It is a platform that incorporates a simple microcontroller and an interface development environment to create the applications to be downloaded on the board. The course offers a three-tiered journey through three levels with each of the three tools. It consists of a total of 9 modules. This course has a very practical approach. A project-based pedagogical methodology is used. Experiments are promoted, where trial and error are part of learning and self-discovery. The student learns to have more autonomy and responsibility. Knowledge is acquired in different disciplines. It develops: motor skills (scale mobility in the hands), group skills, allowing people to socialize, creative abilities, and learning in a fun way. The operational details, materials used and examples of activities for some modules are also presented with the expectation that all teachers will be able to adapt these activities in their class. In addition, results are included from several groups of students who have already completed some modules. Despite not having a large number of students, the experience provided results that may be useful for other teachers to promote a course with similar or equal content for more results. The results of this work show that it is important to combine theory and practice to include fun tasks intertwined with the challenges of applying theory to problem solving.},

  title={Design an Assessment for an Introductory Computer Science Course: A Systematic Literature Review}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={This Research Full Paper presents a literature review on introductory CS assessments. As Computer Science (CS) becomes increasingly popular in the world of big data, more college students are taking introductory CS courses to follow the trend. However, students have different levels of exposure to CS when they start CS in college, varying from no experience to years of coding experience. This disparity in the amount of exposure can pose many problems. In the same intro-level class, some students may think they do not learn anything new, while others believe the professor goes through concepts so fast that they cannot follow the pace. CS professors may also feel confused about how to control the pace and content of introductory courses. Therefore, CS departments need an assessment to measure students’ CS knowledge and then assign them to the appropriate CS introductory courses. Though a vast number of research papers discuss CS introductory courses, few of them focus on developing and validating assessments that evaluate students’ background knowledge (i.e., concept inventory). This paper aims to conduct a systematic literature review to gain an overview of the most important introductory CS contents that need to be assessed, the methods to evaluate students’ understanding of introductory CS concepts, and some existing assessments/concept inventories. By reviewing relevant papers over the last 15 years, we selected 48 papers that are related to assessments and corresponding introductory courses. We collected assessment information and made tables of contents, question types, programming languages, and origins to analyze data. We found that iterations, conditionals, and variables are the most popular assessment contents. Multiple-Choice and Code Writing questions, which are more popular than Code Explaining questions, are the preferred ways of assessing students’ knowledge. Scratch is commonly used as a CS0 assessment language, while Python, Java, C, and Pseudo-codes are employed in CS1 assessments. FCS1, SCS1, and BDSI are existing assessments/concept inventories for CS1 or CS2, but there is not yet a validated assessment or concept inventory that encompasses introductory concepts of CS0 (computational thinking), CS1 (fundamentals), and CS2 (data structure). Designing a comprehensive CS0/CS1/CS2 assessment by using the information collected from our systematic literature review would help students choose the right course and benefit educators and researchers for general use.},

  abstract={This document presents a systematic review of Visual Programming Tools for the Arduino Board. The Arduino board is an embedded platform that focus on enabling an easy way to teach embedded systems, but, due to its success, it ended up being used in different teaching levels, ranging from primary to university. The board was also applied in the teaching of robotics and other contexts since it is relatively cheap, easy to program and its community has produced a considerable amount of free educational material. Even though Arduino is a success it is still maturing in terms of educational purposes, aside the electronic knowledge that needs to be explored, the board is programmed, by default, with c++, which is considered not friendly to Computer Thinking beginners. Trying to solve this problem, many solutions apply Visual Programming, which is proven to make it easy for unexperienced and even children to learn the basis of Computational Thinking, in the educational context with Arduino. Even though there are many solutions applying visual programming for Arduino, there are no systematic review or survey on this subject, meaning that it is hard to identify where are the gaps and which are the problems that are already solved. Therefore, on this paper, it was performed a systematic review on the subject, the method found 372 papers, which 31 were selected for full review. The reviewed solutions where discussed and categorized, we expect that the presented results could be used as guideline for new research in the area and by educators and companies that are looking for visual programming tools for the Arduino board.},

  title={Motivating the New Generation: Using Flipped Classroom and ARCS Model to Enhance Block-Based Programming Education}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={This Research-to-Practice full paper presents an explorative study investigating the effects of flipped learning on the learning motivation of primary school students enrolled in a block-based programming course. Technology development has increased the importance of information technology-related competencies for the new generation. Programming skills are essential in various industries nowadays. Thus, programming education has become necessary to cultivate students' relevant abilities to meet the rapid pace of development. Programming learning encourages students to think logically and systematically, solve problems effectively, and develop computational thinking skills. However, learning programming is challenging for many students for different reasons, such as its inherent complexity, inadequate study methods, and pedagogical approaches unsuited to promote programming learning. Traditional teaching methods are often impersonalized and only suitable for some learning styles present in class. Moreover, the challenges encountered by the students as novice programmers are attributed to their low learning motivation. To learn to program, students must comprehend different syntactic conventions, complex instructions, and logical operators and actively engage in practical learning activities, often facing difficulties. This may reduce their learning motivation leading to failure and dropout. To accommodate different learning styles and increase students' motivation, this study employed the ARCS motivation model to design various innovative activities in a flipped classroom setting to increase students' motivation and improve teachers' teaching effectiveness. The study utilized a pretest-posttest method with two groups of grade five students to compare the effectiveness of teaching and learning between the flipped and traditional classroom students. The study's findings revealed that the flipped classroom experimental group showed significantly higher learning motivation than the students in the control group. Moreover, it was found that different flipped classroom activities, including the use of gamification, flipped videos, self-study, self-questioning, self-assessment, split programming tasks, group cooperation, and demonstration activities, had a positive influence on various sub-dimensions of the ARCS model, such as attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction.},

  title={Automatic detection of bad programming habits in scratch: A preliminary study}, 
  year={2014},
  volume={},

  abstract={Using the Scratch environment as a tool to teach programming skills or develop computational thinking is increasingly common in all levels of education, well-documented case studies from primary school to university can be found. However, there are reports that indicate that students learning to program in this environment show certain habits that are contrary to the basic programming recommendations. In our work as instructors with high school students, we have detected these and other bad practices, such as the repetition of code and object naming, on a regular basis. This paper focuses on verifying whether these issues can generally be found in the Scratch community, by analyzing a large number of projects available on the Scratch community website. To test this hypothesis, we downloaded 100 projects and analyzed them with two plug-ins we developed to automatically detect these bad practices. The plug-ins extend the functionality of the Hairball tool, a static code analyzer for Scratch projects. The results obtained show that, in general, projects in the repository also incur in the investigated malpractices. Along with suggestions for future work, some ideas that might assist to address such situations are proposed in the conclusions of the paper.},

  abstract={We need mobile supercomputers that provide massive computational performance from the power in a battery. These supercomputers will make our personal devices much easier to use. They will perform real-time speech recognition, video transmission and analysis, and high bandwidth communication. And they will do so without us having to worry about where the next electrical outlet will be. But to achieve this functionality, we must rethink the way we design computers. Rather than worrying solely about performance, with the occasional nod to power consumption and cost, we need to judge computers by their performance-power-cost product. This new way of looking at processors will lead us to new computer architectures and new ways of thinking about computer system design.},

  abstract={The key technology that the author would like to see adopted by the masses is a family of software fault injection algorithms that can predict where to concentrate testing. From a novelty standpoint, these algorithms were (and still are) unique among other methods of performing fault injection. The author concedes that the algorithms are computational, but the results can provide unequaled information about how "bad things" propagate through systems. Because of that, he thinks fault injection methods are valuable to anyone responsible for software quality, including those working in one-person independent software vendors (ISVs) or even the largest corporations.},

We currently have a multitude of robotic education tools at our disposal. These tools arise with the aim of promoting innovation and student motivation during the learning process. Robots are becoming more and more common in our society today. Therefore, it is important to integrate robots into all levels of our everyday life. This work is focused on presenting Raspberry Pi as enhancer of educational robotics. The first step is presenting robotics as a tool for promoting the inclusion and integration of students. For this work a background and overview is also provided. The third part proposed different setups to prepare a Raspberry Pi for remote activities and robotics using Arduino as hardware interface. The last but not the least is an open discussion with the aim of exchanging impressions and getting feedback from the attendees.},

  abstract={Robotics and computational thinking are ideal tools for developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. A multitude of educational robotics tools have emerged in recent years. Some with a high price and great features, and others with a lower price and lower performance. There are also cost-effective options that allow you to tailor your services to tighter budgets. The presence of robots in our daily lives is becoming more and more common. Therefore, it is interesting that we are oriented to integrate robots in the different levels of our society. This workshop is focused on driving the same content across three different low-cost robotic educational tools. The first one is Scratch, interactive stories, games and animations can be programed. The second tool is Crumble, it is an easy-to-use programmable controller. Its programming interface uses a block programming language which eases its use by children aged below 14. The last but not the least is Arduino, Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It is a platform that incorporates a simple microcontroller and an interface development environment to create the applications to be downloaded into the board. This workshop is aimed to present the mentioned platforms as robotic educational tools for people as the first step to get into robotics world. Throughout this workshop an initiation to robotics is developed in the context of educational robotics.},

  abstract={The issue of transcribed digit acknowledgment has for some time been an open issue in the field of example order. A few examined have demonstrated that Neural Network has an incredible execution in information arrangement. The fundamental target of this paper is to give effective and solid procedures to acknowledgment of transcribed numerical by looking at different existing arrangement models. This paper thinks about the exhibition of Convolutional Neural Network (CCN). Results demonstrate that CNN classifier beat over Neural Network with critical improved computational effectiveness without relinquishing execution. Handwritten digit recognition can be performed using the Convolutional neural network from Machine Learning. Using the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technologies) database and compiling with the CNN gives the basic structure of my project development. So, basically to perform the model we need some libraries such as NumPy, ‘Pandas’, TensorFlow, Keras. These are the main structure on which my main project stands. MNIST data contains about 70,000 images of handwritten digits from 0–9. So, it is a class 10 classification model. This dataset is divided into 2 parts i.e. Training and Test dataset. Image representation as 28*28 matrix where each cell contains grayscale pixel value.},
