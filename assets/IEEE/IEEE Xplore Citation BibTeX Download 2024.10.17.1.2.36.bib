  abstract={As social robots and other intelligent machines enter the home, artificial emotional intelligence (AEI) is taking center stage to address users’ desire for deeper, more meaningful human-machine interaction. To accomplish such efficacious interaction, the next-generation AEI needs comprehensive human emotion models for training. Unlike theory of emotion, which has been the historical focus in psychology, emotion models are a descriptive tool. In practice, the strongest models need robust coverage, which means defining the smallest core set of emotions from which all others can be derived. To achieve the desired coverage, we turn to word embeddings from natural language processing. Using unsupervised clustering techniques, our experiments show that with as few as 15 discrete emotion categories, we can provide maximum coverage across six major languages–Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Russian. In support of our findings, we also examine annotations from two large-scale emotion recognition datasets to assess the validity of existing emotion models compared to human perception at scale. Because robust, comprehensive emotion models are foundational for developing real-world affective computing applications, this work has broad implications in social robotics, human-machine interaction, mental healthcare, computational psychology, and entertainment.},

  abstract={We utilise a longitudinal dataset of 17 526 speech samples collected from 30 patients with major depressive disorder and 11 sub-clinically depressed individuals to perform a personalised prediction of depressed mood. The data has been recorded via a smartphone app over a two-week ecological momentary assessment with three recording sessions per day. Each session's speech samples are accompanied by a self-assessed rating on the discrete visual analogue mood scale (VAMS) from 0-10. As these ratings are highly subjective, a personalised machine learning method is leveraged. For this purpose, the beginning of the recording period is utilised to train both a shared model backbone, and adapt personalised layers added at the end to each speaker's speech. Our approach yields a Spearman's correlation coefficient (p) of 0.79 on the test set, compared to the non-personalised baseline of p=0.61. Furthermore, we analyse our results with regard to the type of speech sample - reading three depression-related questions, answering them, and freely formulating an uplifting spontaneous thought. Here, we find that personalisation boosts performance across all types, especially for the fixed content question readings. Overall, our work highlights the efficacy of personalised machine learning for depressed mood monitoring.},

  abstract={Analyses and syntheses are a pair of fundamental cognitive processes at the meta-inference layer of the brain. This paper presents the cognitive processes of analysis and synthesis as a part of the brain’s inference mechanisms. The cognitive foundations of analysis and synthesis are explored, and their mathematical models are created in concept algebra and system algebra by concept and/or system decomposition, composition, specification, and aggregation. Based on the cognitive and mathematical models, the cognitive processes of analysis and synthesis are formally described in Real-Time Process Algebra (RTPA). The formal modeling and rigorous explanation of this pair of cognitive processes for formal inference reveal a part of the mechanisms of the brain as modeled in the Layered Reference Model of the Brain (LRMB).},

  pages={355-361},
  abstract={In this study, we investigate how a robot can generate novel and creative actions from its own experience of learning basic actions. Inspired by a machine learning approach to computational creativity, we propose a dynamic neural network model that can learn and generate robot's actions. We conducted a set of simulation experiments with a humanoid robot. The results showed that the proposed model was able to learn the basic actions and also to generate novel actions by modulating and combining those learned actions. The analysis on the neural activities illustrated that the ability to generate creative actions emerged from the model's nonlinear memory structure self-organized during training. The results also showed that the different way of learning the basic actions induced the self-organization of the memory structure with the different characteristics, resulting in the generation of different levels of creative actions. Our approach can be utilized in human-robot interaction in which a user can interactively explore the robot's memory to control its behavior and also discover other novel actions.},

  pages={479-490},
  abstract={A review of recently published papers demonstrates: simulation practitioners apply the standard methods of inferential and descriptive statistics for their reasoning with simulation generated samples without much critical reflection. Yet, simulation-generated samples differ in important aspects from empirical samples, for which the standard statistical methods have been developed. Simulation models do have inherent epistemic and computational limits for replication that do not exist with empirical data sets. Consequently, neither is simulation-based data generation the same as the collection of empirical data nor is the analysis of synthetic data equally beneficial as of empirical data. These differences are much more fundamental for computer simulation than the problems of specific techniques of inferential statistics which have been criticized recently. If simulation generated data is used for testing research hypotheses the core issue is not the method of statistical reasoning but the assurance of what might be called evidential content.},

  abstract={The use of MapReduce (MR) model has attracted much attention because of the reductions in the costs involved in satisfying the storage and computational demands. However, authentication methods proposed for such model is subjected with rooms for improvements. In the initial design and implementation of the MR model such as Hadoop, issues of security including authentication was not considered. It was assumed that the underlying system worked in a trustworthy environment, so MR developers did not provide authentication methods in the MR model. This assumption is still valid to some extent, whereas major IT players in the world, such as Facebook and Yahoo have implemented the MR model in their private clouds. However, recently there are efforts to provide the MR model in public clouds. Inadequate authentication methods for the MR model in such environment makes the job execution work-flow vulnerable to many attacks such as impersonation and spoofing attacks. So as part of our work to design a secure and effective authentication solution for the MR model, this paper examines and critically analyses the state-of-the-art in MR authentication methods against a general set of specified requirements. It is to identify limitations, weaknesses, and missing features in the proposed authentication methods for the MR model.},

  year={2012},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={In this computational study for acquiring syntactic containment constructions, we suggest that emergent structures in the sensorimotor space may help limit the search for linguistic patterns to a much smaller corpus, in which the earliest glimmerings of syntax may originate. We consider an early learner exposed to perceptual data (video) with co-occurring word-segmented commentaries. In the initial stages of an incremental statistical learning process, content words (e.g. object names) are acquired. Then, some prototypical containment categories emerge by clustering spatial relations in the perceptual input. These situational regularities are used to focus only on sentences uttered during containment situations. By using k-gram and path alignment models on this limited corpus, we show that such a system may begin to learn word categories as well as syntacto-semantic constructions such as “into the X”/[IN(tr,X)]. A key step in the process is the structure in which this perceptual knowledge is organized. The term “image schema” has often been used to refer to such structures, but has widely divergent interpretations. We view the image schema as a category oracle; initially limited to spatio-temporal situation, it may extend, with increasing exposure to language, to new situations.},

  year={2019},

  pages={388-394},
  abstract={The presence of artificial agents in human social networks is growing. From chatbots to robots, human experience in the developed world is moving towards a socio-technical system in which agents can be technological or biological, with increasingly blurred distinctions between. Given that emotion is a key element of human interaction, enabling artificial agents with the ability to reason about affect is a key stepping stone towards a future in which technological agents and humans can work together. This paper presents work on building intelligent computational agents that integrate both emotion and cognition. These agents are grounded in the well-established social-psychological Bayesian Affect Control Theory (BayesAct). The core idea of BayesAct is that humans are motivated in their social interactions by affective alignment: they strive for their social experiences to be coherent at a deep, emotional level with their sense of identity and general world views as constructed through culturally shared symbols. This affective alignment creates cohesive bonds between group members, and is instrumental for collaborations to solidify as relational group commitments. BayesAct agents are motivated in their social interactions by a combination of affective alignment and decision theoretic reasoning, trading the two off as a function of the uncertainty or unpredictability of the situation. This paper provides a high-level view of dual process theories and advances BayesAct as a plausible, computationally tractable model based in social-psychological and sociological theory.},

  abstract={The development of social media in the form of websites and android applications should be appreciated. The background of this research is the stage to develop the software needed to know the age range. The objective thing to observe is through the visitor’s face on the web or application. The purpose is to avoid false information and get the proper process flow. The Technology used is deep learning for facial image recognition. The methods use Convolutional Neural Network with residuals because the advantage is using multi-branch layers but having a stable training process. The use of augmentation is needed to increase the variety of facial recognition image positions and to overcome unbalanced classes. The dataset used consists of seven categories, namely Children, Youth, Early Workers, Middle Ages, Pre-Retirement, Retirement, and Old People, which Bappenas regulate. Each folder contains about 1157 images with a total data of 8,105 images. The training process results can obtain a model with an average accuracy of 99.08% and a computational training time of about three hundred minutes. The model’s accuracy is 99.08%, with MSE 0.0037, RMSE 0.0610, and MAE 0.0037. Testing time is about 2 seconds.},

  year={2024},
  volume={12},

  pages={63484-63503},
  abstract={The emerging Human-Centric Networks (HCN) paradigm shifts the passive role of individuals to an active one, intertwining the uncertainty of network resource usage with human dynamics, which are difficult to analyze and predict. This phenomenon implies an increase in reciprocal interactions between Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS) and human activities, presenting the challenge of efficiently allocating network resources while taking into account qualitative human uncertainty. In this study, we propose a conceptual model that addresses and quantifies such uncertainties. The proposed model is characterized by its adaptability to various CPSS applications, facilitating its integration into existing applications and future innovations. The adaptability of the model is based on the application of the sociological concept of Boundary Objects (BO), which allows for the structuring of system components and the generation of a reference architecture that facilitates systematic problem solving. To evaluate the model, we propose a use case related to a Vehicle for Hire (VFH) application operating within a 5G network slice. The integration of the proposed model with the OMNET++ simulation framework has allowed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in intricate computational environments and have shown its capacity to incorporate previously overlooked elements that are essential for the optimal allocation of resources in CPSS. This study proposes a methodology for comprehending and mitigating the consequences of human uncertainty, emphasizing the significance of a multidisciplinary approach to resource allocation in sophisticated technological systems.},

  pages={36055-36065},
  abstract={The increasing computational demands of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) models, particularly for embedded systems in autonomous vehicles and drones, present significant challenges owing to their extensive neural network complexities. Previous DRL compression strategies predominantly focused on unstructured pruning, effective for reducing model size but requiring specialized hardware for computational acceleration. Conversely, DRL models with structured pruning applied can be accelerated on standard hardware, though they typically encounter performance issues at higher pruning rates due to structural constraints. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces an advanced structured pruning methodology, combined with scaled policy constraints (SPC) for DRL models. Our approach overcomes the performance limitations of conventional structured pruning, achieving high pruning rates while maintaining robust model performance. Enhanced performance restoration after pruning is achieved by fine-tuning with SPC and applying structural regularization, thus ensuring efficient decision-making with a minimal computational burden. Extensive evaluations on the D4RL benchmark and in a drone control simulation environment confirm the effectiveness of our method. Our approach maintains performance integrity even at high pruning rates, with less than a 2% decrease in normalized score at 90% pruning in D4RL and preserving cumulative reward at 87% pruning in drone control simulation. Significantly, our approach also enables considerable computational acceleration on standard hardware. We implemented our method on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX board and achieved a 2.5-fold speed-up on devices with NVIDIA Volta GPUs and over double the speed-up on those with NVIDIA Carmel ARMv8.2 CPUs. These outcomes highlight our method’s suitability for real-time, resource-constrained applications, demonstrating its practicality and efficiency.},

  pages={605-610},
  abstract={The interest in deep neural networks for solving computer vision task has dramatically increased. Due to the heavy influence of the neural networks architecture on its predictive accuracy, neural architecture search has gained much attention in recent years. This research area typically implies a high computational burden and thus, requires high scalability as well as availability to ensure no data loss or waist of computational power. Moreover, the thinking of developing applications has changed from monolithic once to microservices. Hence, we developed a highly scalable and available multi-objective neural architecture search and adopted to the modern thinking of developing application by subdividing an already existing, monolithic neural architecture search - based on a genetic algorithm - into microservices. Furthermore, we adopted the initial population creation by 1,000 mutations of each individual, extended the approach by inception layers, implemented it as island model to facilitate scalability and achieved on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset 99.75%, 94.35% and 89.90% test accuracy respectively. Besides, our model is strongly focused on high availability empowered by the deployment in our bare-metal Kubernetes cluster. Our results show that the introduced multi-objective neural architecture search can easily handle even the loss of nodes and proceed the algorithm within seconds on another node without any loss of results or the necessity of human interaction.},

  abstract={Alzheimer's disease progress over several years, it slowly ruins memories and thinking ability, and eventually the capacity to carry out daily tasks, leading to full-time care. The brain shrinks and loses brain cells as a result of Alzheimer's disease. While the condition can strike at any age, most patients with Alzheimer's disease are over 65.. Alzheimer patients mostly have Symptoms like memory loss, disorientation and problems with thinking ability but vary from person to person. Although genetics, environment, and lifestyle are the most likely causes of this illness, other experts think there may be multiple causes. The term “dementia” refers to brain illnesses that impair thinking, memory, and behaviour. The most typical cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. Patients with Alzheimer's disease typically struggle to speak clearly, identify relatives and friends, and recognise items. They can also become angry, restless, and frustrated. As Alzheimer's disease progresses, physical issues like weakness, loss of balance, and impaired bladder and bowel control appear. In this study paper, we will introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a machine learning technique, to recognise Alzheimer's disease. On the input image, image segmentation is carried out. CNN is a group of artificial neural networks that provides a more scalable approach to image classification and identification of patterns in images. Convolution is a mathematical procedure that CNN employs in place of matrix multiplication at one layer. CNN are different from other neural networks by their exceptional performance with audio, image or speech signal inputs. CNN algorithm take an input image, assign priority to different aspects for an image to find difference between images. CNN Captures Spatial and Temporal dependencies of an image using application of relevant filters.},

  abstract={Whenever anyone focuses attention to solve a problem through Operations Research and Management Science methodology, it is required to address the problem from the perspective of scientific thinking as well as from the thinking of Art side. Sense of both science and arts is required to shape a totality. However, it is noted that much has been written about the science of decision making: mathematical models, solution algorithms, procedures following structural analysis etc. But unfortunately it is observed that relatively very little has been written in the perspective of Arts to solve the problems. There is no denying the fact that the creativity is the most important attribute of good management and it also helps to drill longitudinally and laterally sense of research and innovative ideas and conceptions and things will assume totality as and when both the sense of Arts and Science is meaningfully applied. Thus creativity is very much linked with problem solving but it is observed that it has, ironically, been largely ignored as a very important and forceful weapon of OR/MS problem solving process. In this paper a sincere attempt has been taken to synthesize explicitly OR/MS literature which has got closed link with creative thinking for solving problems and we shall try to provide here a framework for integrating structured creative thinking technologies with regard to OR/MS methodology and we will also discuss in this perspective of its implication for education, research and practice.},

This requires to protect meta-data from observation. We think that this feature is in particular useful and interesting for the Internet-of-Things. However, it requires strong cryptographic security mechanisms, like encryption of communication, to be in place. We motivate the need for strong privacy protection by highlighting privacy issues in a smart home use-case. We advance beyond encryption and discuss which existing techniques can be used to achieve unobservable communication. Then we describe the architecture needed to provide strong protection in this particular use-case. Lastly, we present the building blocks of the architecture we implemented so far on the Re-Mote sensor nodes running Contiki OS and sketch the computational and network overheads imposed by these techniques.},

In this paper, we present an architecture for enabling interoperability between the Tunisian national grid GTRS, based on the Peer-to-Peer middleware XtremWeb-CH, and the grid infrastructure of EU funded project EUMEDGRID based on gLite.In particular, we describe the solution related with the job submission mechanism that allows for users of EUMEDGRID to send jobs to GTRS.A new concept of Super Worker Node is proposed in this work to reach the interoperability between the two grids of GTRS and EUMEDGRID.},

  abstract={This work investigates the complications of robotic learning using reinforcement learning (RL). While RL has enormous potential for solving complex tasks its major caveat is the computation cost- and time-intensive training procedure. This work aims to address this issue by introducing a humanlike thinking and acting paradigm to a RL approach. It utilizes model-based deep RL for planning (think) coupled with inverse kinematics (IK) for the execution of actions (act). The approach was developed and tested using a Franka Emika Panda robot model in a simulated environment using the PyBullet physics engine Bullet. It was tested on three different simulated tasks and then compared to the conventional method using RL-only to learn the same tasks. The results show that the RL algorithm with IK converges significantly faster and with higher quality than the applied conventional approach, achieving 98%, 99% and 98% success rates for tasks 1-3 respectively. This work verifies its benefit for use of RL-IK with multi-joint robots.},

  abstract={In this article, the issue of human behavior learning (HBL) is addressed for a class of nonlinear human-in-the-loop (HiTL) systems where the human operator is viewed as a nonlinear optimal controller. Owing to its outstanding interpretability and strong nonlinear representation capability, the Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model is employed to represent the nonlinear HiTL control system and approximate the unknown human control law based on the parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme. A quadratic-like cost function with fuzzy weighting matrices is built to depict the human behavior, which conforms to human thinking and is unknown to the machine. The aim of the HBL is to retrieve the fuzzy weighting matrices such that the human control law will be optimal in the sense of minimizing the retrieved cost function. In the proposed HBL scheme, the state-dependent Riccati equation-based nonlinear optimal control technique plays an important role, which has a similar structure to the linear quadratic regulator theory and thus is of low computational complexity. With the help of the PDC-based fuzzy approximator for the unknown human control law, a two-step procedure is proposed for the HBL. First, a filter-based adaptive law is developed to learn the gain matrices of the fuzzy approximator using the system state data only. The convergence analysis of the adaptive estimator is also given. Then, a semidefinite programming problem with the quadratic objective function can be set up for determining the fuzzy weighting matrices of the cost function. The simulation study on a steering control system of the intelligent vehicle is given to show the effectiveness and applicability of the developed approach.},

  abstract={With the development of human science and technology, applications of computer are more and more comprehensive. Using artificial intelligence (AI) to drawing, thinking, and problem solving becomes a significant topic. Recently, research on automatic composition using AI technology and especially evolutionary algorithms is blooming and has received promising results. A common issue at the current evolutionary composition systems is their requirement for subjective feedback of human sensation as evaluation criterion, which is vulnerable to the fatigue and decreased sensitivity after long-time listening. This paper proposes using music theory with the information from music charts in the evaluation criterion to address this issue. Specifically, we generate the weighted rules based on music theory for the fitness function. The weights are determined according to the download numbers from music charts. These weights obtained can interpret the music style and render an objective measure of compositions. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively achieve satisfactory compositions.},

  abstract={Quantitative financial analysis requires repeated computations of the same functions with the same arguments when prototyping trading strategies; many of these functions involve resource intensive operations on large matrices. Reducing the number of repeated computations either within a program or across runs of the same program would allow analysts to build and debug trading strategies more quickly. We built a disk memoization library that caches function computations to files to avoid recomputation. Anymemoization solution should be easy to use, minimizing the need for users to think about whether caching is appropriate, while at the same time giving them control over speed, accuracy, and space used for caching. Guo and Engler proposed a similar tool that does automatic memoization by modifying the python interpreter, while the packages Jug and Joblib are distributed computing tools that have memoization options. Our library attempts to maintain the ease of use of the above packages for memoization, but at the same time give a higher degree of control of how caching is done for users who need it. We provide the same basic features as these other libraries, but allow control of how hashing is done, space usage for individual functions and all memoization, refreshing memoization for a specific function, and accuracy checking. This should lead to both increased productivity and speed increases for recomputation. We show that for several financial calculations, including Markowitz Optimization, Fama French, and the Singular Value Decomposition, memoization greatly speeds up recomputation, often by over 99%. We also show that by using xxhash, a non-cryptographic hash function, instead of md5, and avoiding equality checks, our package greatly outperforms joblib, the best current package.},

  abstract={Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has always been an important research topic for applying artificial intelligence in smart healthcare. Sufficient medical data are one of the most critical factors in CAD research. However, medical data are usually obtained in chronological order and cannot be collected all at once, which poses difficulties for the application of deep learning technology in the medical field. The traditional batch learning method consumes considerable time and space resources for real-time medical data, and the incremental learning method often leads to catastrophic forgetting. To solve these problems, we propose a real-time medical data processing method based on federated learning. We divide the process into the model stage and the exemplar stage. In the model stage, we use the federated learning method to fuse the old and new models to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem of the new model. In the exemplar stage, we use the most representative exemplars selected from the old data to help the new model review the old knowledge, which further mitigates the catastrophic forgetting problem of the new model. We use this method to conduct experiments on a simulated medical real-time data stream. The experimental results show that our method can learn a disease diagnosis model from a continuous medical real-time data stream. As the amount of data increases, the performance of the disease diagnosis model continues to improve, and the catastrophic forgetting problem has been effectively mitigated. Compared with the traditional batch learning method, our method can significantly save time and space resources.},

  abstract={Existing approaches to procedural level generation in 2D platformer games are, with some notable exceptions, procedures designed to do the work of a human game designer. They offer the usual benefits and disadvantages of AI applied to a cognitive task: they can work much faster than a human level designer, and are in some cases able to explore the design space automatically to find levels with desirable qualities. But they aren't able to capture the human creativity that produces the most interesting level designs, and they are usually very specific to their particular domain. This paper introduces occupancy-regulated extension (ORE), a general geometry assembly algorithm that supports human-design-based level authoring at arbitrary scales.},
