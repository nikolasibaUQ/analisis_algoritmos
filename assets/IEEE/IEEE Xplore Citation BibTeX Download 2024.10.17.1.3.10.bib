  abstract={The history of art techniques in western art has been a march toward increasing the control, precision and speed of the artist. The arrival of the computer and its associated technology follows this tradition. By thinking of the computer as an agent, the range of detail that is possible is no longer limited by a person's physical ability and, therefore, new kinds of images are possible. The range of the machine's capability is illustrated by my own large digital portraits. Although pregnant with opportunity, there also exist drawbacks to the process that currently act as stumbling blocks to its widespread adoption.},

  abstract={The design of sophisticated control systems have led in the past ten years to the necessity of satisfying more than one design criterion. Thus, it is natural to think that those criteria can be met in an optimal manner. If several criteria have simultaneously to be optimized, one is in presence of a Multi-Objective Optimization problem. However, the search process of an optimum requires a very high computation burden and the convergence can be very slow. In this paper, the most popular Pareto methods are compared by solving a parametric MOO problem of controller design.},

  pages={3431-3435},
  abstract={Semantic similarity between words is a generic problem for many applications of computational linguistics and artificial intelligence. The difficulty of this task lies in how to find an effective way to simulate the process of human judgment of word similarity by combining and processing a number of information sources. This paper presents a novel model to measure semantic similarity between words in the WordNet, using edge-counting techniques. The fundamental idea of this model is based on the assumption that human judgment process for semantic similarity can be simulated by the ratio of common features to the total features between words. According to the experiment against a benchmark set by human similarity judgment, our measure achieves a better result. The correlation is 0.926 with average human judgment on a standard 28 word-pair dataset, which outperforms other previous reported methods.},

Our study aims to detect suicidal ideation from social media-based using Natural Language Processing (NLP). We have applied the best feature extraction methods- Genetic and Linear Forward Selection (LFS) to select the best features from our feature vectors using our proposed formula. Moreover, We have created a robust feature set based on different computational and linguistic features. Finally, we have shown that by applying our hybrid feature extraction method we can get a significant increase in our accuracy to detect ideation.},

  abstract={Educators have attempted to innovate the teaching-learning process through computational tools. Some medical educational applications have been created with Augmented Reality resources. Serious Games are one of these kinds of applications, aiming as purpose education or training tasks for users considering entertainment too. Augmented Reality games require appropriate devices for satisfactory experience, as well a usability evaluation to ensure the application's efficiency. With this in mind, this study presents a systematic review to identify approaches that use Mixed or Augmented Reality games in the teaching-learning process of medical contents, and that execute at least one preliminary evaluation with users. Only six selected studies attend the eligibility criteria. We notice a lack of Mixed or Augmented Reality serious games in many medical areas, such as hematology. This work also verified that the evaluation process of these games no adopts a standard protocol or well-known instruments available in the literature for usability evaluation, revealing an opportunity for new studies.},

  abstract={Smooth Skinning is still the most popular method for the animation of deformable human and creature characters. It has became almost an industry standard because of its intuitiveness to use and efficiency to compute. However it suffers from a number of problems, such as the collapsing elbow and candywrapper effect. In this paper, we present a new method, which is able to solve these defects with very little extra stretching computations. The advantage of this method is its compatibility with the current animation workflow. The animator can change the skin weight any way they like and therefore it favours creativity. The aim of our method is trying to retain the realism and computational efficiency at the same time. It is suitable for situations, where real time response is necessary, like computer games. A practical implementation in the form of a Maya plug-in is created to demonstrate the viability of the method.},

  abstract={This paper studies the design and implementation of billboard recognition system based on deep learning neural network. Billboard recognition system is based on neural network. The main idea behind the system is to identify billboards by using a set of image features. These functions are used to train neural net-works, so it can also be applied to other applications. What are the benefits of using neural networks? Compared with traditional methods (such as regression analysis and clustering algorithms), neural networks have many advantages because they can provide better results at lower computational cost than these methods. The billboard recognition system is based on neural network. Neural network architecture of billboard recognition system in this paper, we will discuss how to use python programming language to create a neural network for recognizing images and texts. We will also learn how to train neural networks using a back propagation algorithm with an example data set and a 94% accuracy score.},

  abstract={Often, textual data is accompanied by images in an attempt to help the user better understand the content. Drawing inspiration from this, it would be interesting to transform any given text into a digital image collage, an artistic graphic object. To automate the process, we developed a software system that uses Natural Language Processing to summarize large paragraphs of text, retrieves images from databases, and arranges them with a Genetic Algorithm on a digital canvas. Given that certain images may be more important to the user, the software computes emphasis factors for scaling the images in the collage. We performed computational experiments to validate each module of our system and initiated user studies to examine their perception of the collages.},

  abstract={The government of Japan has announced the new ICT policy in June 2010. One of the points of the new policy is to start the 3D motion image content market in order to create new key industries in the near future as 3D motion image content will become most powerful media for CGM (Consumer Generated Media). In order to activate 3D motion image content industries, the development of an effective and simple tool for making 3D motion image content even by non-experienced people, is required. The Digital Movie Director (DMD) developed by the author, is being evolved as such an effective and simple tool. However, the big computational power requirement in making 3D motion image content has prevented DMD from being widely deployed. The cloud computing technology is supposed to solve this problem, thus, in this paper, the future prospects of the 3D motion image content industries with the cloud computing technology will be explained.},

Context often resides in the warfighterpsilas "conversation," or in manual hand gestures in the battlefield. The primary tactical method for capturing this information resides in text chat and voice communications. There is a primary reliance on text chat (due to its persistence) in hostile tactical environments with little to inform its practice or its improvement. We focus on three areas to improve the ability to communicate SA context by (1) developing a computational approach to acquiring chat SA themes from unstructured text; (2) exploiting the use of icons, images, and symbols in developing an SA language; and (3) prototyping a new technology of inscription with the development of data-generating gloves.},

  abstract={The current study is to determine whether people mentally simulate the movement when they process fictive motion sentences in Mandarin Chinese (e.g., xiăo ji̅ng zŏu rù se̅n lín “A trail goes to the forest”), which literally include no movement in a space but implicitly entail the motion in our conceptual system. We conducted a depiction task to instruct participants in drawing what they thought when they read fictive motion sentences and non-fictive motion sentences in Mandarin Chinese. After the drawing task, three participants that did not join the drawing task judged whether the trajectory was lengthened or not in the pictures according to their intuition. The experimental results show that trajectories depicted for the fictive motion sentences were judged significantly more lengthened than those for the non-fictive motion sentences. The findings of our study suggest even though there is no explicit movement involving in the meanings of fictive motions in Mandarin, people automatically simulate the movement and the trajectories. This study has practical implication for computational linguistics in analyzing subtle semantic meanings among motion verbs.},

Based on parameter optimization and tuning for the main steam temperature cascade control systems in power plants with serious parameter uncertainty, multi-disturbance and large delay, the simulation results show that this method has the advantages of fast optimization and low computational complexity; it is very effective for cascade PID parameter optimization and endues main steam temperature control systems with better control qualities and better system robustness.},

  abstract={Studying how intelligence analysts use interaction in visualization systems is an important part of evaluating how well these interactions support analysis needs, like generating insights or performing tasks. Intelligence analysis is inherently a fluid activity involving transitions between mental and interaction states through analytic processes. A gap exists to complement these transitions at micro-analytic level during data exploration or task performance. We propose Behavioural markers (BMs) which are representatives of the action choices that analysts make during their analytical processes as the bridge between human cognition and computation through semantic interaction. A low level semantic action sequence computation technique has been proposed to extract these BMs from captured process log. Our proposed computational technique can supplement the problems of existing qualitative approaches to extract such BMs.},

  abstract={In recent years, with the extensive application of artificial intelligence in various fields, the research on how to apply artificial intelligence to education has gradually become the focus of attention. Knowledge map is a giant semantic network composed of nodes and edges, which represents the semantic association between different nodes in the form of large-scale graph. Knowledge map, as a structured storage form of multi-domain data in the real world, provides semantic relevance between data and makes it possible for artificial intelligence to make better use of data. The research of representation learning based on knowledge map realizes the distributed representation of entities and relationships, significantly improves the computational efficiency, effectively alleviates the problem of data sparseness and can realize the fusion of heterogeneous information, which is of great significance for people to obtain effective information from massive data. In view of the above situation, taking WebQA data set as an example, this paper proposes a method to simplify the original text, introduce apriori knowledge related to answers from the knowledge map, and use neural network model to generate Chinese questions. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can effectively reduce the difficulty of model training and improve the quality of model problems.},

  abstract={Openflow provides a key step in abstracting network functions by separating the control and the forwarding plane. However, current rather rigid switches constrain packet processing programmability. It is therefore complex to implement flexible packet classification within existing ASIC-based switches, especially when forwarding switches rely on a restricted set of tables. In this paper, we introduce a flexible mechanism for assigning rule entries to switch tables. Accordingly, we propose a conceptual abstraction that tailors Openflow forwarding paths to the hardware switch. Our approach aims to provide an optimal mapping of entries to physical tables. Its main idea consists in using a semantic analysis to reflect the computational relation between rules and a set of packet descriptors characterized by predefined table entries.},

From the perspective of the overall process of the traditional Chinese handicrafts in promoting the design expression of the modern creativity, Chinese traditional handicrafts still have great research value in the process of promoting the expression of the modern creative design. The existing creative design expression methods have the problems of high feature dimensions, large computational overhead or relatively low detection rate and so on. In this paper, a kind of traditional Chinese handicrafts that promote the expression of the modern creative design based on the computer multimedia technology is put forward. This method is aimed at the modern creative processing of the traditional Chinese handicrafts, using the computer multimedia technology to process the traditional Chinese handicrafts. The experimental results show that this method has relatively low time complexity and high detection rate than those of the traditional methods. In addition, it has relatively good robustness for the traditional Chinese handicrafts in promoting the expression of the modern creative design.},

  abstract={Villanelle is an interactive fiction authoring tool designed to support autonomous non-player characters, or “char-acter AI.” Character AI is notoriously challenging for interactive fiction authors to develop, especially for authors approaching interactive fiction from a writing rather than programming background. This paper describes a participatory design process in which we assess the author experience with Villanelle and build a new tool iteration to support their needs. The results of our first user study demonstrate the strong potential of Villanelle's incorporation of behavior trees as an easy-to-Learn computational model for character AI, but they also indicate syntax challenges for inexperienced programmers. Consequently, we developed a block-based programming interface for Villanelle and recruited a new set of study participants to evaluate this iteration using the same study instruments. The results indicate improvements in Villanelle's usability and creativity support for inexperienced programmers.},
