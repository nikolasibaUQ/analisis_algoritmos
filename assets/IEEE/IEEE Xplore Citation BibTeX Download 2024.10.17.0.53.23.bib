  abstract={In this section, we will report on three applications of evolutionary algorithms (EA) in real world parameter optimization. These applications show how the principles, such as robustness and representation independence, make it possible to extend the scope of optimization algorithms available so far and find answers to problems where classical solution methods fail.Evolutionary algorithms are today a state-of-the-art methodology in solving hard optimization problems, and are regularly being used in industries such as automotive and aerospace. In fact, these algorithms have revolutionized the way hard problems are being solved today. The pioneers of evolutionary computation, including Larry Fogel as one the key founders of the field, have been laying the foundations with their creativity and visionary approach toward science.},

  abstract={Computational thinking has become a required capability in the student learning process, and digital games as a teaching approach have presented promising educational results in the development of this competence. However, properly evaluating the effectiveness and, consequently, student progress in a course using games is still a challenge. One of the most widely implemented ways of evaluation is with an automated analysis of the code developed in the classes during the construction of digital games. Nevertheless, this topic has not yet been explored in aspects such as incremental learning, the model and teaching environment and the influences of acquiring skills and competencies of computational thinking. Motivated by this knowledge gap, this paper introduces a framework proposal to analyze the evolution of computational thinking skills in digital games classes. The framework is based on a data mining technique that aims to facilitate the discovery process of the patterns and behaviors that lead to the acquisition of computational thinking skills, by analyzing clusters with an unsupervised neural network of self-organizing maps (SOM) for this purpose. The framework is composed of a collection of processes and practices structured in data collection, data preprocessing, data analysis, and data visualization. A case study, using Scratch, was executed to validate this approach. The results point to the viability of the framework, highlighting the use of the visual exploratory data analysis, through the SOM maps, as an efficient tool to observe the acquisition of computational thinking skills by the student in an incremental course.},

  abstract={Can a robot think like a human being? Scientists in recent years have been trying to achieve this dream, and we are also committed to this same goal. In this paper, we use an example of throwing the ball into the basket to make the robots process with human-like thinking behavior. Such thinking behavior adopted in this paper is divided into two modes: fast and slow. The fast mode belongs to the intuitional reaction, and the slow mode represents the complicated cogitation in human brain. This fascinating human thinking concept is inspired by the book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, which explains the process of the human brain. In addition, the psychology theories proposed in this book are also adopted to realize the thinking algorithms, and our experiments verify that the thinking mode of human beings is reasonable and effective in robots.},

  abstract={In this paper, we analyzed whether the ability of students to solve problems can be influenced by the implementation of Computational Thinking (CT) in the teaching of mathematics. In this sense, we performed a quasi-experiment with students in the Brazilian's Basic Education Regular System (particularly in a group of students around fifteen years old) comparing their performance after being trained with practical activities using exercises in more or less conformity with well known CT concepts and capabilities. Considering the quantitative results obtained, the experimental group outperformed the control group, which worked with exercises in more and less conformity with CT, respectively. The results were statistically significant, suggesting that bringing together CT and mathematics through proper adjustments of classroom practices can have a positive influence on students abilities of solving problems. In order to strengthen this conclusion we also performed a qualitative analysis comprising students and the teacher involved in the quasi-experiment that reinforced our quantitative results.},

  abstract={Developing students' Computational Thinking (CT), which is an essential problem-solving skill for people living in the 21st century, becomes an outstanding purpose of promoting engineering education in K-12 classrooms. In this paper, CT is represented through the graphical programming language Scratch according to the three-dimensional CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick [1]. This project aims to explore the classroom effect of using graphical programming tool in learning English dialogue and investigate how to improve the integration of CT into English education with the elements of programming. To achieve these objectives, a qualitative method was adopted to collect data through class observations, programming projects, and semi-structured interviews. Nine primary students (n = 9) were the targeted participants, who attended extra-curricular lessons for computer programming using Scratch at their school in Hong Kong. The preliminary results show that the introduction of CT into English dialogue learning through graphical programming language can motivate primary school students to study English dialogue. To better connect CT with English education via graphical programming tools, students and the teacher in the group under study suggested making computers interact with people autonomically, designing games in graphical programming environments to encourage English learning, keeping the balance of students' graphical programming language learning skill and their English language skill, and adopting graphical programming language as a tool to finish the summative English language assignments.},

  abstract={Many countries have included or consider to include computational thinking in their educational curricula. This creates the need for a carefully planned educational approach involving different stakeholders as policymakers, educators and students. These stakeholders are the main carriers of the educational reforms thus their perspectives create various challenges and risks. In this paper, we propose a pedagogical approach of teaching coding through games and gamification of the learning process. The flipped classroom is used in order to address the shortcomings in teacher training and deliver learning outcomes in student-centred, fun and engaging way. Proposed solution includes a spiral curriculum implemented in 4 cycles that alternate cooperative and individual learning approach. The approach was evaluated with more than 199 students from 6 different schools. Evaluation analyses were focused on the achieved learning experience identifying differences between male and female students, as well as students with different level of access to ICT resources. The results confirm the benefits of the proposed solution.},

  abstract={The uniqueness of Augmented Reality (AR) is its affordance to support learning abstract concepts by rich information, visualization and the integration of user-content interaction. Research has shown that abstract idea and invisible phenomena can be learned better with the support of AR. However, high complexity and conceptual Computational Thinking (CT), such as algorithm design and related programming concepts, are rarely studied empirically in the intersection with immersive technology. This study is aimed at addressing this issue and providing a piece of quantitative and empirical evidence to AR-supported Computer Science discipline-based learning. We designed a mobile AR-enabled application based on a CT framework and related AR affordances in the literature. This app can contextualize a programming debugging task and support program editing & CT learning. A controlled laboratory study was designed and conducted. The result of statistical analyses shows that participants with the AR support made better quality of programs with lower errors and less amount of code edits, compared to those without the AR support.},

  abstract={This Research-to-Practice Full Paper evaluates an online programming course for K-12 educators that aimed to teach Computational Thinking (CT). CT is widely defined as a set of skills, such as problem solving and systems design, that rely on Computer Science principles. As these skills are increasingly demanded in modern society, it is critical to include CT in K-12 education to boost not only computing courses, but various other disciplines. However, most educators do not yet know the basics of CT and Computer Science fundamentals, particularly in Brazil. In this context, we designed and implemented an online programming course for K-12 educators to provide qualification in CT and Programming basics, as well as to assess learners' attitudes towards Computing, how their motivation are expressed during the course, and the correlation between motivation and attitudes. The results indicate that participants' attitudes towards Computing has become more positive after the course, primarily their comprehension of CT and confidence to learn Computer Science. The outcomes also suggest a high level of learners' motivation over the course, and reveal a high correlation between the relevance expressed in the course with their interest and confidence towards Computing.},

  abstract={The demand for additional engineering and computing degree graduates continue to increase [1, 2]; however, interest in pursuing these degrees is not matching the predicated demand. More specifically, attracting US students in engineering and computing field has always been a challenge; this is particularly true for female and minority students. Factors such as the "geek image", a demanding mathematical foundation, lack of "gee whiz" element early in the curriculum, and overall misconception about the career in these areas are all contributors to this problem. This paper describes some of our activities associated with the introduction of Computational Thinking (CT) concepts to middle and high schools. The central tenet of the project is to entice students in grade 6-12 to learn some fundamental and advance topics in engineering and computing field, thereby recognizing their own ability to understand the computing and engineering topics, and potentially recognizing their interest in such topics and potential further education and career in these fields.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) skills are necessary for solving the real-world problems of today and are therefore being incorporated into K-12 curricula. Cybersecurity is of similar importance; however, it can be difficult for young learners to grasp the required concepts and use them to construct meaningful algorithms. We discuss our approach that combines a hands-on robotics platform with a block-based programming environment to facilitate the learning and application of cybersecurity and CT concepts. Throughout a week-long intervention, high school students were introduced to cybersecurity and CT and given the opportunity to apply this knowledge in a collaborative setting to solve security problems on the robotics platform with instructor and peer support. A series of competitions between groups of students further motivated students to translate their learned concepts to practice, often leading to breakthroughs as students incorporated new algorithms into their existing projects to counteract previous security flaws. We present evidence of the learning behaviors of several such groups through mixed-method case studies integrating data collected from learning performance, collaborative discourse, and analysis of program development. We discuss the impact of this approach on cybersecurity and CT learning and then present future directions for this work.},

  abstract={A Computational Thinking (CT) training program proposes a set of instruments to be used in the training, and also a set of recommendations on how to use them. To design such a program it is necessary to have a deep knowledge about the meaning of CT and its targets. Although CT skills are of paramount importance to all (since they bring numerous advantages for problem solving activities), in our context we see them as a pre-requisite for the learning of Computer Programming (CP). In order to design a CT training program supported by a rigorous framework, we decided to build an ontology that goes deeper into the underlying concepts and relates both domains, CT and CP. The outcome, OntoCnE (that stands for Ontologia para Computação na Escola in Portuguese), made clear what shall be trained in terms of reasoning to understand programming and being able to use it to solve problems using the computer. Moreover, OntoCnE also provides a clear insight on the concepts to be taught in each scholar year, as well as, on the instruments (hereafter called Learning Resources, LR) to be used in each moment for each specific purpose. This paper aims to introduce OntoCnE and demonstrates how to use it to classify LRs aiming to build a repository from where they can be picked up in a clear way. Finally, we demonstrate, through the PathIt resource, how the characterization of a concrete LR is performed in OntoCnE.},

  abstract={Computational Thinking (CT) skills are a key competency for all citizens, but for Computer Programming students these abilities are crucial. Several studies claim that students have deficits in many of the CT skills and therefore it is important to develop and improve these skills. For that purpose, Teachers responsible for the children’s education have to plan as soon as possible effective ways for training CT skills. There are already many Learning Resources (LR) for this training, however, we believe that Neuroeducation can contribute to improving the impact of these LR in the teaching and learning process. Currently, Educational Neuroscience presents a solid set of scientific evidence on how the brain learns more effectively. This important knowledge about the brain’s learning process can be turned into principles applicable in Education. This paper starts emphasising those principles that can benefit the teaching and learning process. Based on this scientific evidence, we propose the adoption of a set of guidelines that can contribute to innovative CT training. Neuroeducation applies the latest theoretical advances in the human brain and psychology to pedagogy. The guidelines inspired by Neuroeducation that we propose here aim to provide instructions for the teacher to apply in their pedagogical practices and in LR, in order to promote more effective training. One concrete LR for primary school, created by our Master’s Students in Computing Education, will be used, as a case study, to illustrate our proposal.},

  abstract={This paper examines K-12 teacher perspectives on the promise and challenges of computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education for all students across three states and three school districts-one rural, one suburban, and one urban. Through a series of teacher survey and focus groups, this exploratory research presents the perspectives of K-12 teachers across three distinct vantage points: First, to what degree do these teachers see a clear value as to why CS and CT matter to their students' learning? Second (if the pathway is deemed valuable) who, in their estimates, are the crucial players to help develop a coherent CS/ CT K-12 pathway and what is their capacity? Third, how can such a prospective pathway be practically implemented? These elements of why, who, and how are essential to wider questions around equity of student access to high quality computing, and with this paper, they come from the perspectives of teachers-a group too often left out of early discussions around K-12 curricular design. Discussion section points to how these preliminary surveys and focus groups with teachers offer an early predictor in terms of how each district develops its own K-12 computing pathway, with the expectation that such focus groups offer a powerful research/ evaluation protocol that can be repeated annually among districts to gauge to what extent teachers' hope (and concerns) about comprehensive K-12 computing pathways are warranted.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) assessment indicator assignment is an important strategy for optimizing assessment and an effective method for exploring differences in the importance of assessment indicators. However, the objectivity of the previous methods for assigning assessment indicators of CT is insufficient. Therefore, the paper proposed to use the XGBoost machine learning model to fit the assessment data, fully explore the data features and realize the weighting of CT assessment indicators. The CT assessment indicators are used as the features of XGBoost model training and the assessment levels are used as the training labels to obtain the feature weights through XGBoost model training. The feature weights are used as the CT assessment indicator weights to realize the weighting of assessment indicators of CT in reverse. From the analysis of the CT assessment indicator assignment results, the analysis of the importance of the assessment indicators and the comparative analysis of the assessment results before and after the indicator assignment, it is found that the CT assessment after the indicator assignment has higher robustness and credibility.},

  abstract={There is a national need to increase the number of minority students entering STEM fields with essential computing skills. To increase minority students’ interest and engagement in computing, a researcher-practitioner partnership between the University of Texas at El Paso and the El Paso Independent School District, developed and implemented a culturally and linguistically responsive curriculum and pedagogy to introduce computational thinking (CT) in two middle schools across different subject areas in a borderland region. The curriculum leveraged the Sol y Agua game – a bilingual, culturally-responsive game designed to engage students of this region in CT. This paper describes the process and initial findings of this project. The quantitative data from in-game analyses show that students utilized the language change feature to switch from English to Spanish more frequently than the other way – highlighting the need for educational platforms relatable to students through language, environment, and cultural context. Analyses of the qualitative data indicate that while teachers/team members understood CT and translanguaging concepts and taught lesson units that provided opportunities to practice both, CT and translanguaging were largely implicit in the curriculum. In collaborative analyses of these patterns, teachers described additional supports that would help them to make CT instruction and translanguaging strategies more explicit in the content and pedagogy, highlighting the need for systematic, targeted integration of these concepts.},

  abstract={Computational Thinking (CT) is a transversal ability to solve problems in any area, is crucial for Computer Programming. We believe that CT skills should be developed and encouraged from a young age. However, to promote the development of CT it is necessary to use appropriate materials, which we call Learning Resources (LR). For a more efficient development of CT, it is important that the LR are designed and used in order to obtain the maximum potential of the resource. Scientific evidence from Neuroeducation can be used to fully explore LR. There are many LR available to promote CT, however, they are not correctly classified in order to be easy to understand what specific CT skills they stimulate, neither which ages they are adequate for. Directions for their most convenient usage are also lacking. This paper aims to present an approach to categorize these LR so that when a teacher intends to promote the development of one or more specific CT skills, in a given schooling year, he can find the adequate LR more easily, and also get educational resources concerning their use. This characterization approach is based on OntoCnE ontology. OntoCnE was built by us and is composed of 4 layers that define: how to develop CT (1); which concepts should be taught at each school level (2); which materials are appropriate for each skill (3); and the Neuroeducation guidelines associated with each resource (4). This paper essentially focuses on layers 3 and 4 to perform the LR characterization. To illustrate our approach, we will follow OntoCnE statements to categorize a set of LRs. With this methodological setting we intend to build a catalog of LR more effectively promote CT skills on children.},

  abstract={Research Purpose and Contribution: The study aimed to construct an evaluation framework for assessing pupils’ computational thinking (CT) during classroom learning problem solving. As a self-report evaluation scale for pupils, this evaluation framework further enriched the CT assessment instruments for pupils and provided a specialized instrument for experts to evaluate pupils’ CT in problem-solving situations during classroom learning.  Background: CT cultivation and assessment methods are hot topics in the field of education. CT assessment can effectively test the effect of CT cultivation. There are many CT assessment methods, of which evaluation frameworks are an effective self-reporting assessment method. Existing studies on self-reported CT evaluation frameworks are commonly applicable to students at different stages. However, few studies have focused on the specific context from the perspective of practice for pupils. Thus, the evaluation framework of pupils’ CT is worth exploring.  Intended Outcomes: A CT evaluation framework for evaluating pupils’ CT in problem-solving situations in classroom learning was constructed to facilitate researchers’ understanding of pupils’ CT levels and problem-solving skills.  Application Design: In this study, data from 897 pupils in the fifth and sixth grades were collected using an online questionnaire that included 27 items about CT. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and item analysis were conducted to analyze the data in this study, with 17 items remaining in the final evaluation framework.  Findings: The fitting validity, convergence validity, and discriminant validity all met the recommended criteria, which showed that the evaluation framework was effective. The total reliability of CT was 0.911, indicating that the consistency and reliability of the evaluation framework constructed in this study were satisfied.},

  abstract={Computers are often used as tools to design, implement, and even visualize a variety of narrative forms. Many researchers and artists are now further attempting to engage the computer actively throughout the development of the narrative itself. Any form of computational narrative authoring is at some level always mixed-initiative , meaning that the processing capabilities of the computer are utilized with a varying degree to automate certain features of the authoring process. We structure this survey by focusing on two key components of stories, plot and space, and more specifically the degree to which these are either automated by the computer or authored manually. By examining the successes of existing research, we identify potential new research directions in the field of computational narrative. We also identify the advantages of developing a standard model of narrative to allow for collaboration between plot and space automation techniques. This would likely benefit the field of automated space generation with the strengths in the field of automated plot generation.},

  abstract={For robot intelligence and human-robot interaction (HRI), complex decision-making, interpretation, and adaptive planning processes are great challenges. These require recursive task processing and meta-cognitive reasoning mechanism. Naturally, the human brain realizes these cognitive skills by prefrontal cortex which is a part of the neocortex. Previous studies about neurocognitive robotics would not meet these requirements. Thus, it is aimed at developing a brain-inspired robot control architecture that performs spatial-temporal and emotional reasoning. In this study, we present a novel solution that covers a computational model of the prefrontal cortex for humanoid robots. Computational mechanisms are mainly placed on the bio-physical plausible neural structures embodied in different dynamics. The main components of the system are composed of several computational modules including dorsolateral, ventrolateral, anterior, and medial prefrontal regions. Also, it is responsible for organizing the working memory. A reinforcement meta-learning based explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) procedure is applied to the working memory regions of the computational prefrontal cortex model. Experimental evaluation and verification tests are processed by the developed software framework embodied in the humanoid robot platform. The humanoid robots' perceptual states and cognitive processes including emotion, attention, and intention-based reasoning skills can be observed and controlled via the developed software. Several interaction scenarios are implemented to monitor and evaluate the model's performance.},

  abstract={With the development of computer technology, the current concept of “computational thinking” has been generally recognized by everyone. “Computational thinking” provides strong support for the development and research of various disciplines. The reform of university computer basic courses guided by “computational thinking” has become an important direction for the current reform of computer public basic courses. In recent years, our school’s series of reform measures based on the public basic courses of computer have achieved obvious results, which proves that this orientation is worthy of promotion.},

  abstract={Educational Robotics (ER) is a tool that can favor teamwork, stimulate creativity, and the ability to solve students' problems through the process of assembling and programming robots. In this sense, ER has been used to improve educational practices. There are several initiatives that seek to stimulate Computational Thinking (CT) to stand out. Although ER being used to develop CT, there are still no guidelines based on scientific studies that support this use. The objective of this Research Full Paper is to identify: a) the main pedagogical approaches are applied in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; b) the central difficulties are encountered in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; c) the CT skills are presents in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; d) the instruments are used to assess students' CT during classes with ER; e) the students' profile who participated in classes with ER focused o on developing students' CT; f) the educational robotics technologies are adopted in classes focused on developing students' CT. To achieve these goals, we planned and carried out systematic mapping of the literature. The results show that, through ER, CT is approached through the teaching of programming languages in a collaborative way in Early Childhood and High School. The most CT skills observed are related to programming, such as sequencing, algorithm, loop, generalization, decomposition, and debugging. The main instruments for assessing students are tests, and the most significant difficulty is the limitation of class hours. Finally, LEGO® is the most used technology in class.},
