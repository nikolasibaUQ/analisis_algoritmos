  abstract={Modern information-intensive applications require timely access to temporally accurate data. This demands the collection, integration and processing of temporally-coherent data and its display in a "continuous" fashion. When utilizing several pieces of information, each must be fresh relative to the use of that information-and together, they must be relatively consistent. The techniques used must ensure temporal coherency among the data being integrated. When information from multiple media must be processed and presented, the quality of the final information must "make sense". This leads to semantic coherency requirements. Techniques must support the processing of such data under strict timing concerns too. Timeliness is an important QoS (quality of service) parameter. The impedance mismatch between what users think they want and what the system components involved are and what they can deliver, plus the multiplicity of components that must be orchestrated together makes the problem of guaranteeing a specified QoS a challenging one. Specifically, we need (1) precise ways of specifying QoS requirements and (2) an integrated platform supporting hard real-time control tasks, multimedia data and a distributed data repository, built over a common set of computational resources. In this paper, we elaborate on these two needs.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Autonomous swarm control, which is expected to be able to handle multiple unmanned vehicles (UxVs), is an important technology that can be applied to many operations and incorporated in many systems. For operations in real environments, we have to consider severe conditions under which communications between UxVs may be inadequate and the environment changes unexpectedly. In addition to optimality, adaptability (meaning robustness to severe and unexpected conditions) is important in real situations. However, there are no quantitative benchmarks for algorithms to have both optimality and adaptability. Here, to reconcile optimality and adaptability, we have developed an “autonomous and adaptive control”. The distinctive features of this algorithm is that it simply uses the purposes of a system, such as efficiencies, to control elements and it has a distributed optimization architecture without a centralized control unit. We think that it is promising for autonomous swarm control with optimality and adaptability in real environments. In this paper, we benchmark several swarm control algorithms including our own. We compare two conventional algorithms with ours in a scenario involving a continuous search operation where the UxVs keep moving and searching. We also devise performance indicators for this operation and evaluate the algorithms in terms of them. The results obtained from computational simulations show that our algorithm maintains the efficiency of the search operation at a high level. That means the algorithm is a promising approach for achieving both optimality and adaptability.},

  abstract={An increasing number of tools have been created to assist students in learning mathematics. Robots have been regarded as an especially powerful tool to help students master mathematics since students can simultaneously learn mathematics, programming, robotic control, and computational thinking. Although a number of educational robots and curricula have been developed, some of them do not comply with math standards, so they are primarily suitable for after-school programs, camps, or workshops. Students might not be able to focus on learning mathematics now that writing a program might be difficult for them due to debugging. In this paper, mathematics curricula that meet math standards are developed with a block-based programming platform, Roboblocky. Linkbots are utilized as robots in the curricula to teach and learn mathematics in school settings. Students learn mathematics by observing the motions of robots in simulations or on real mats. Most students improved greatly in mathematics after using the curricula. It is expected that the curricula based on Roboblocky will continue to be improved to enable more middle and high school students to be successful in learning mathematics.},

  abstract={Distributed storage, which is one of the main functions of distributed computing, enables clients of cloud services to think of their data as being stored in the cloud and to share it with qualified customers. In distributed storage, stable deduplication has been widely researched because it can eliminate overt repetitiveness within scrambled data to reduce storage space significantly. In the field of safety and protection, many current continuous deduplication schemes highlight to a large extent the associated characteristics: information classification, label consistency, access control animal attack assaults. One technique for ensuring the accuracy of information in garage outsourcing is confirmed information possession. The article discusses the development of a green PDP scheme for a distributed cloud garage to facilitate provider migration scalability and statistics, where we keep in mind the lifecycle of multiple cloud service providers to maintain and maintain collaborative customer statistics. The cooperative scheme relies entirely on verifiable homomorphic reactions. Completeness, knowledge soundness, and zero-knowledge qualities may all be satisfied by our multi-proof zero-knowledge proof system, which strengthens the security of our system. The experiment shows that this solution has lower computational and communication overhead than non-cooperative approaches.},

  abstract={The human brain is a marvel of complex and dynamic networks that enable us to move, sense, think, and remember. How do these networks constantly reconfigure themselves in real-time to process information? To answer this question, we need reliable methods able to capture the dynamics of the dominant functional 'states'. However, this task is challenging due to the diversity of the available pipelines that are difficult to evaluate. Here, we present an overview of a computational framework that combines electrophysiological data with dynamic functional connectivity approach (dFC) followed by dimensionality reduction methods. We highlighted the utility of such framework in tracking the dynamics of key brain network states. Then, we provide a practical example on real MEG data during fast motor task. Our analysis evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed framework including several instances of decomposition and clustering techniques in capturing relevant spatial and temporal patterns of brain network reconfiguration.},

  abstract={Compliance management is a critical financial and legal subject for organizations. It is operationally implemented by embedding internal controls into business processes and their supporting IT systems. Challenges arise from the complexity of real-life processes and systems, their continuous monitoring and the timely communication of thereby detected problems. In order to realize effective and efficient monitoring, the responsible persons must be supported by suitable compliance software. This compliance software should enable the responsible persons to get both high-level information regarding the overall compliance status and low-level information regarding possible problems. Furthermore, it should not be limited to passive reporting components for compliance management, but also allow for interactive user interfaces, which facilitate the proactive supervision of tasks. The aim of this work is to encourage the responsible persons to analyze and explore compliance information through their appropriate visualization. Thus, unique and valuable human strengths, such as lateral thinking, can be used aside from the computational strengths of compliance software during control monitoring.},

  abstract={Social network is one of the vibrant topic and allow researcher to think in various dimension to provide results with wide scope. In this paper we are aimed at optimizing cluster to enhance the result. It helps to increase the computational performance of a social network as well as maintaining the valid nodes for bidirectional interaction between end users. Proposed methodology applies Girvan Newman clustering algorithm along with minimum cut algorithm for optimization purpose which makes effective interaction with in social communication network. Our research includes two major phases in it. During first phase we apply Girvan Newman algorithm to cluster the nodes with common behavior, properties and characteristics. In the second phase, application of minimum cut algorithm will be done into clustered social network nodes. The major objective is to analyze network nodes and make them stable and active and to remove the nodes that are not interacting with any network nodes that is inactive nodes. Such inactive nodes make the less efficiency and inaccurate communication. For these kind of problem, we are going to apply minimum cut algorithm. It will maximize the effective bidirectional interaction by removing the unwanted, noisy and inconsistent nodes from these clusters.},

  abstract={This research to practice work in progress has two main objectives: i) the improvement of interdisciplinary teaching and learning processes in an integrated course of informatics in high school course and; ii) turning students into learners by the designing and development of innovative features for m-learning applications. Such objectives are integrated each other, since the improvement in the teaching and learning processes will not be restricted in the proposal and use of a practical framework for the improvement of students' skills in the computational thinking, but also in the use of the m-learning features and applications to improve educational issues faced by both students and teachers. In this perspective, active-learning and problem-based learning theories were considered to support the proposal of a series of activities composing a framework to be adopted to achieve the target objectives. The interdisciplinary teaching and learning processes improvement has its roots at the proposal of solutions for problems into disciplines of high school curricula through the innovative m-learning features to be designed and developed by the students. In this paper it is discussed the motivations about the proposal of this project, the teaching and learning implications in the context of a integrated course of informatics in high school course, its planning and a pilot conduction of mainly initial activities with the volunteers students. Such activities include: (a) the identification of problems and the planning of solutions based on m-learning features; (b) the design and development phases of an initial set features; and (c) a preliminary evaluation of usability of some mockups of m-learning application. At the end, the identified evidence are discussed, mainly those related with the implications for the interdisciplinary scenario for the teaching and learning processes, the initial identification of benefits in the perspective of the participation of students as learners and the future work, as well.},

By integrating Computational Thinking into lower-level courses, the proposed project also seeks to strengthen Computer Science students and better prepare them to meet the modern demands in the field. In the first year of the project there have been several changes to the curriculum content of the gateway courses as well as the implementation of the summer pre-college program. The summer 2014 was the first computing pre-college program. There were nineteen participants currently in the summer program. The students were engaged and excited to be a part of this program. The Computer Science Seminar course served as the initiative for a supplemental undergraduate research award request. The course focused not only ensuring the students understand computer science as a field of study, but also how computer science impacts all fields of study and everything in their daily lives. There were several speakers, FBI, Industry, University faculty, and previous graduates. The initial results has been extremely rewarding as we noticed from their performance in the first semester program course, CS1. This poster will discuss the curriculum we used during the summer program, sample exercises, feedback from students as well as lesson learnt for us to improve next year program.},

  abstract={The STEM methodology has been applied in different study approaches, covering different areas such as arts, internet of things, computational thinking, among others. In this paper, two necessary approaches are addressed for the implementation of a closed-loop control system. The first approach (programming) is directly related to the software implementation and the second approach addresses the hardware instrumentation part. Both approaches are developed in a practical teaching case, from a STEM Maker workshop which consisted of 15 sessions with duration 2 hours each one. Each session consisted of 4 stages: Stage 1 (Theoretical concepts), Stage 2 (Practical Example), Stage 3 (Practice) and Stage 4 (challenge). Through these four stages, the development of skills of the attendees in the areas of programming and electronics was encouraged, applying the STEM Maker strategy. From some evaluation instruments, data was collected about the development of skills of the assistants in the implementation of software and hardware instrumentation, acquired in the STEM Maker workshop. The results indicated that approximately 70% of the workshop attendees developed the necessary skills to propose solutions to problems in their current context where the application of programming and/or electronics intervenes. The product obtained from the practice is described as a temperature control which integrates a feedback signal, this system has a wide field of applications which allowed the students of the STEM Maker workshop to achieve a project related to the individual context of each one.},

  abstract={In this competitive industry era, industry should think about how to efficient their process of production. In the foundry and smelting industry, downtime not only increases make span and reduces machine availability, but also increases energy consumption. That means strategy to keep the production stabile is very important to minimize energy wasting. This condition need good condition machinery, and required optimum maintenance strategy. Modeling Production planning system with machine unavailability intervals has gained more attention to life cycle cost of manufacturing companies. Modelling production planning subjected to maintenance activities decreases machine degradation rate and unscheduled unavailability that may result lower breakdown of production. In this paper will In this paper, we propose Bi-objective optimization approach for energy aware scheduling considering continuous energy consumption cost and preventive maintenance multi resource (machine and dies as tools). Multi objective goal programming is proposed to solve this problem. The extensive computational experiments are conducted. The results show that the integrated optimization method of production scheduling and preventive maintenance outperforms the method with Corrective maintenance as a case study model for this problem, results also show the effects of different flexibilities of resources for job processing.},

  abstract={Computational thinking has become pervasive across many technical and creative disciplines. Creating a computationally literate workforce capable of recognizing and eliminating algorithmic discrimination requires diverse perspectives and lived experiences. Diversity within computing is a persistent problem; in 2014, several large tech companies released diversity reports and made commitments to improvement. As of 2020, improvements have been minor, especially for Black employees. Compared to US demographics, the percentage of Black and Latinx students pursuing degrees in computing remains low, even as numbers improve in STEM more broadly. It is more important than ever to prioritize a diverse computing workforce and a computationally literate workforce, more broadly, whose interests reside with equitable outcomes.},

  abstract={6G is currently under definition, often being addressed from a plain telecommunications perspective as an evolutionary paradigm that represents an extension of 5G. Having as its horizon 2030, 6G initiatives are being deployed across the globe, to further ignite the development of 6G services. In its philosophy core, 6G embodies the &#x201C;human in the loop&#x201D; principle. The research effort aimed at 6G requires an interdisciplinary approach that ignites discussion across different key technological sectors, ranging from communications to services and business cases. The contribution of this book to research in the field concerns an evolutionary and interdisciplinary design of 6G as a paradigm that can be addressed by working together the four different computational areas of CONASENSE: communications; satellites and navigation; sensing; services. This book starts with a perspective on 6G challenges towards sustainability and addressing new business models, moving on to key topics concerning communications. It ends with chapters focusing on 6G service design. This book is, therefore, envisioned to assist in developing critical thinking to back up novel networking, applications, and services towards 6G.},

  abstract={In this paper, a novel gradient descent learning algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) applied on Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) is proposed in order to approximate the functions which have high non-linear order. How we can choose the strategy of gradient descent including learning coefficients selecting and really is it optimized to learn the same for all feature vectors?, are the challenges made us to think precisely on those. In this study, GMM estimates the probability density of the feature space and then the optimal learning rates can be evaluated proportional to these probabilities. These cause the neurons to learn correspondence with the feature distribution likelihoods. Considering robust satellite subset selection, Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) factor is calculated for all subset of satellites and then the subset with lowest value is selected for positioning, but it is so non-linear and has computational burden to navigation systems. We use the proposed method to approximate it. The results on real GPS measurements demonstrate that it significantly track the non-linearity of GPS GDOP.},

  abstract={Hyperspectral images occupy a very important position when it comes to remote sensing imaging due to their multi band and high precision characteristics. However, due to the redundancy caused by various bands and the large amount of calculation, Reducing the size of hyperspectral photographs is important. This article proposes a program that combines cross genetic thinking with artificial bee colony algorithm (hereinafter referred to as Ag) to select the features of hyperspectral images, In the preprocessing stage, the initial feature set of the image is screened by using the outlier detection method based on the percentage level, and the feature set after the initial screening is selected by Ag algorithm. Finally, the selected band combination is sent to the neural network combining three-dimensional convolution and two-dimensional convolution for training, Experimental results on the Pavia University and Indian Pines datasets show that the algorithm has good convergence, and the band combination obtained with low computational complexity can achieve better classification accuracy and consistency in image classification.},
