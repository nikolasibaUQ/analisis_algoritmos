  abstract={One of the biggest challenges in intelligent robotics is to build robots that can learn to use language. To this end, we think that the practical long-term on-line concept/word learning algorithm for robots is a key issue to be addressed. In this paper, we develop an unsupervised on-line learning algorithm that uses Bayesian nonparametrics for categorizing multimodal sensory signals such as audio, visual, and haptic information for robots. The robot uses its physical body to grasp and observe an object from various viewpoints as well as listen to the sound during the observation. The most important property of the proposed framework is to learn multimodal concepts and the language model simultaneously. This mutual learning framework of concepts and language significantly improves both speech recognition and multimodal categorization performances. We conducted a long-term experiment where a human subject interacted with a real robot over 100 hours using 499 objects. Some interesting results of the experiment are discussed in this paper.},

  abstract={Systems Analysis modelling is considered foundational for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) students, with introductory and advanced units included in nearly all ICT and computer science degrees. Yet despite this, novice systems analysts (learners) find modelling and systems thinking quite difficult to learn and master. This makes the process of teaching the fundamentals frustrating and time intensive. This paper will discuss the foundational problems that learners face when learning Systems Analysis modelling. Through a systematic literature review, a framework will be proposed based on the key problems that novice learners experience. In this proposed framework, a sequence of activities has been developed to facilitate understanding of the requirements, solutions and incremental modelling. An example is provided illustrating how the framework could be used to incorporate visualization and gaming elements into a Systems Analysis classroom; therefore, improving motivation and learning. Through this work, a greater understanding of the approach to teaching modelling within the computer science classroom will be provided, as well as a framework to guide future teaching activities.},

  abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AZM) is a deadly neurology syndrome caused by memory loss. It is the most common kind of dementia. It is a syndrome that begins with modest memory loss and gradually deteriorates your thinking abilities, occasions, and ability to execute day-to-day routine tasks. It affects the areas of the brain that govern cognition, memory, and language. It has the potential to have a significant influence on a person's ability to carry out everyday responsibility. Because no drug or cure has yet been discovered, it is critical to forecast it at an early stage. The prediction of Alzheimer's disease is done manually by evaluating MRI scans; nevertheless, the risks of human mistake are quite high with this method. The purpose of this research is to improve prediction accuracy in order to detect AZM at an early stage and prevent the patient from progressing to a severe state of the disease. In this research, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Softmax classifier (i.e., CNN+Softmax) has been used to identify and categories the AZM MRI into four distinct classes, namely mild demented (MD), moderate demented (MOD), non-demented (ND), very mild demented (VMD). The proposed CNN+Softmax model is then compared by replacing the dense layer of CNN to Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, i.e., CNN+SVM and the work is calculated on the various grids which includes accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score. On test data, the presented approach surmounted the CNN+SVM model with a classification accuracy of 98.59 percent.},

  pages={632-643},
  abstract={Due to the variety of devices and operating scenarios in an integrated energy system (IES), the optimal dispatch of an IES is usually complicated. An optimal dispatch method for an IES is proposed by defining the scheduling value for each device which can be different under various scenarios. First, thinking over the private and public attributes of each operating equipment, the evaluation system is established with the actual scenarios of economic, environmental and energy-savings being considered. Secondly, the economic, environmental and energy-saving benefits of each operating equipment are quantified by Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Therefore, the scheduling value of the device is comprehensively assessed according to the specific scenario. Finally, decomposing the output of the device into direct available energy and indirect available energy, an optimal model is built with the maximum general production benefits as the objective, and is solved by MATLAB and CPLEX. The simulation results show that the evaluation system can reflect multiple values of devices. The proposed model can unify the modeling of optimal dispatch for different scenarios in the IES and can improve dispatch efficiency, while ensuring the accuracy of the results with high computation efficiency.},

  abstract={We present a framework that incorporates the principle of bounded rationality into a pursuit-evasion game between two aerial vehicles in a stochastic wind field. We initially formulate the problem as a continuous zero-sum stochastic game under perfect rationality. We then discretize the game via the Markov Chain Approximation Method. Leveraging the cognitive hierarchy theory (“level-k thinking”) we relax the perfect rationality assumption and compute the solution of the ensuing discrete game, while taking into consideration the rationality level of each agent. We also present an online algorithm to infer the rationality of the opponent, which enables the agents to deploy appropriate countermeasures. Finally, we verify the efficacy of this framework through simulations.},

  year={2023},
  volume={29},

  pages={853-863},
  abstract={Analyzing classification model performance is a crucial task for machine learning practitioners. While practitioners often use count-based metrics derived from confusion matrices, like accuracy, many applications, such as weather prediction, sports betting, or patient risk prediction, rely on a classifier's predicted probabilities rather than predicted labels. In these instances, practitioners are concerned with producing a calibrated model, that is, one which outputs probabilities that reflect those of the true distribution. Model calibration is often analyzed visually, through static reliability diagrams, however, the traditional calibration visualization may suffer from a variety of drawbacks due to the strong aggregations it necessitates. Furthermore, count-based approaches are unable to sufficiently analyze model calibration. We present Calibrate, an interactive reliability diagram that addresses the aforementioned issues. Calibrate constructs a reliability diagram that is resistant to drawbacks in traditional approaches, and allows for interactive subgroup analysis and instance-level inspection. We demonstrate the utility of Calibrate through use cases on both real-world and synthetic data. We further validate Calibrate by presenting the results of a think-aloud experiment with data scientists who routinely analyze model calibration.},

  title={Software reliability growth model based on Bohrbugs and Mandelbugs}, 
  year={2015},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={381-386},
  abstract={Recent research characterizes two types of program errors. The repeatable class, called Bohrbugs, always cause the same error with the same inputs. Prior thinking and reliability growth models were based on Bohrbugs, (Bbugs). Another class of errors called Mandelbugs, (Mbugs), are difficult to reproduce even with the same inputs, [1], [2]. Mbugs may be an interaction of inputs with computer storage, where computer storage represents the past history of inputs to the computer system [3]. A small fraction of Mbugs which increase with time, aging-related Mbugs, are ignored in the model. This paper formulates a software reliability growth model for predicting operational reliability of the software as development progresses. Based on prior experience, constant and exponentially decreasing error removal models are assumed. The inputs to the model are error removal data for both Bbugs and Mbugs, recorded during development testing and mean time to failure data from simulated operational tests. Simplified values for the model parameters are developed based on moment estimates. More sophisticated estimates using least squares and maximum likelihood techniques are discussed. The potential for improving the accuracy of reliability estimates by using models that incorporate both Bbugs and Mbugs is discussed with respect to two examples.},

  year={2013},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={404-411},
  abstract={In this paper, we study an approach for discovering brand associations by leveraging large-scale online photo collections contributed by the general public. Brand Associations, one of central concepts in marketing, describe customers' top-of-mind attitudes or feelings toward a brand. (e.g. what comes to mind when you think of Burberry?) Traditionally, brand associations are measured by analyzing the text data from consumers' responses to the survey or their online conversation logs. In this paper, we go beyond textual media and take advantage of large-scale photos shared on the Web. More specifically, we jointly achieve the following two fundamental tasks in a mutually-rewarding way: (i) detecting exemplar images as key visual concepts associated with brands, and (ii) localizing the regions of brand in images. For experiments we collect about five millions of images of 48 brands crawled from five popular online photo sharing sites. We then demonstrate that our approach can discover complementary views on the brand associations that are hardly obtained from text data. We also quantitatively show the superior performance of our algorithm for the two tasks over other candidate methods.},

  abstract={Image inpainting is an important task in computer vision. As admirable methods are presented, the inpainted image is getting closer to reality. However, the result is still not good enough in the reconstructed texture and structure based on human vision. Although recent advances in computer hardware have enabled the development of larger and more complex models, there is still a need for lightweight models that can be used by individuals and small-sized institutions. Therefore, we propose a lightweight model that combines a specialized transformer with a traditional convolutional neural network (CNN). Furthermore, we have noticed most researchers only consider three primary colors (RGB) in inpainted images, but we think this is not enough. So we propose a new loss function to intensify color details. Extensive experiments on commonly seen datasets (Places2 and CelebA) validate the efficacy of our proposed model compared with other state-of-the-art methods. The source code and pretrained models are available at https://reurl.cc/RzD11n.},

  year={2021},

  pages={650-657},
  abstract={Due to the popularity of the Computer science field many students study programming. With large numbers of student enrollments in undergraduate courses, assessing programming submissions is becoming an increasingly tedious task that requires high cognitive load, and considerable amount of time and effort. Programming assignments usually contain algorithmic implementations written in specific programming languages to assess students' logical thinking and problem-solving skills. Evaluators use either a test case-driven or source code analysis approach when evaluating programming assignments. Given that many marking rubrics and evaluation criteria provide partial marks for programs that are not syntactically correct, evaluators are required to analyze the source code during evaluations. This extra step adds additional burden on evaluators that consumes more time and effort. Hence, this research work attempts to study existing automatic source code analysis mechanisms, specifically, use of deep learning approaches in the domain of automatic assessments. Such knowledge may lead to creating novel automated marking models using past student data and apply deep learning techniques to implement automatic assessments of programming assignments irrespective of the computer language or the algorithm implemented.},

  abstract={The remarkable achievements of ChatGPT and Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) have sparked a wave of interest and research in the field of large language models (LLMs) for artificial general intelligence (AGI). These models provide intelligent solutions that are closer to human thinking, enabling us to use general artificial intelligence (AI) to solve problems in various applications. However, in the field of remote sensing (RS), the scientific literature on the implementation of AGI remains relatively scant. Existing AI-related research in RS focuses primarily on visual-understanding tasks while neglecting the semantic understanding of the objects and their relationships. This is where vision-LMs (VLMs) excel as they enable reasoning about images and their associated textual descriptions, allowing for a deeper understanding of the underlying semantics. VLMs can go beyond visual recognition of RS images and can model semantic relationships as well as generate natural language descriptions of the image. This makes them better suited for tasks that require both visual and textual understanding, such as image captioning and visual question answering (VQA). This article provides a comprehensive review of the research on VLMs in RS, summarizing the latest progress, highlighting current challenges, and identifying potential research opportunities. Specifically, we review the application of VLMs in mainstream RS tasks, including image captioning, text-based image generation, text-based image retrieval (TBIR), VQA, scene classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. For each task, we analyze representative works and discuss research progress. Finally, we summarize the limitations of existing works and provide possible directions for future development. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current research progress of VLMs in RS (see Figure 1), and to inspire further research in this exciting and promising field.},

Another special ratio for ripple restriction is proposed, taking practical work into consideration. Some design and simulation tradeoffs for corresponding problems are also presented.

  pages={279-291},
  abstract={In order to keep trace of information and grow up, the infant brain has to resolve the problem about where old information is located and how to index new ones. We propose that the immature prefrontal cortex (PFC) uses its primary functionality of detecting hierarchical patterns in temporal signals as a second feature to organize the spatial ordering of the cortical networks in the developing brain itself. Our hypothesis is that the PFC detects the hierarchical structure in temporal sequences in the shape of ordinal patterns and uses them to index information hierarchically in different parts of the brain. Henceforth, we propose that this mechanism for detecting ordinal patterns participates also in the hierarchical organization of the brain during development; i.e., the bootstrapping of the connectome. By doing so, it gives the tools to the language-ready brain for manipulating abstract knowledge and for planning temporally ordered information; i.e., the emergence of causality and symbolic thinking. In this position paper, we will review several neural models from the literature that support serial ordering and propose an original one. We will confront then our ideas with evidence from developmental, behavioral, and brain results.},

  abstract={Manufacturing through the use of cloud computing has been further extended using cloud manufacturing technology. According to the literature, the benefits of this approach include transparency, cost-efficiency, sharing of resources and the scalability of production. A multi-agent system-informed ontology used in manufacturing environments facilitates knowledge storage, inference and retrieval especially for the case of distributed resources. Based on service-oriented thinking, a cloud manufacturing OWL-S ontology model is proposed. Ontology mapping and an inference engine will be used to complete service request, publishing and binding processes. A new cloud-oriented manufacturing service OWL-S ontology would provide an extension to the Web framework, which introduces a semantic description of manufacturing services. This is for the cloud to build upon theoretical foundations and comply with standards. Manufacturing services are built in with a cloud-based negotiation mechanism using agent division, cooperation, competition and negotiation to achieve dynamic cloud manufacturing services' aggregation and running. ANALYSIS is a complex, non-linear, large cloud dynamic system for manufacturing. It is a cloud-based agent model represented in IDEF0 view, and functions on the basis of analysis of the mode of operation. Cloud services are adaptable to clients' needs, and these may include various stages of a product lifestyle, including product design, manufacturing, testing and management.},

  abstract={System control - the issuing of commands - is a critical, but largely unexplored task in 3D user interfaces (3DUIs) for immersive virtual environments (IVEs). The task sequence (the order of operations in a system control task) is an important aspect of the design of a system control interface (SCI), because it affects the way the user must think about accomplishing the task. Most command line interfaces are based on the action-object task sequence (e.g. "rm foo.txt"). Most graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are based on the object-action task sequence (e.g. click on an icon then select "delete" from a pop-up menu). An SCI for an IVE should be transparent and induce minimal cognitive load, but it is not clear which task sequences support this goal. We designed an experiment using an interior design application context to determine the cognitive loads induced by various task sequences in IVEs. By subtracting the expected time for a user to complete the task from the total time, we have estimated the cognitive time, dependent only on task sequence. Our experiment showed that task sequence has a significant effect on the cognitive loads induced in IVEs. The object-action sequence and similar task sequences induce smaller cognitive loads than those induced by the action-object sequence. These results can be used to create guidelines for creating 3DUIs for IVEs},

Hybrid modeling attempts to bring together the complementary benefits of differing dynamic modeling approaches, such as System Dynamics and Agent-based modeling, to bear on a single research question. We present here, by means of an example, a hybrid modeling technique that allows different modules to be specified separately from their implementation. This enables each module to be designed and constructed on an ad-hoc basis. This approach results in 3 benefits: it facilitates incremental development, a key focus in agile software design; it enhances the ability to test and learn from the behavior of a dynamic model; and it can help with clearer thinking about model structure, especially for those of a hybrid nature.},

Researchers have applied different models of personality analysis in various software engineering areas to identify improvement points, to promote job satisfaction and to better organize teams. This paper aims to conduct a study, by means of an experience report, to evaluate the MBTI personality model (Myers-Briggs Type Indication) applied to software developers and to understand how human personality influences professionals' work. The experience was applied in one private university to 6 developers to measure quality of developed software by means of Object Oriented Software Metrics. Each software analyzed was developed by a single developer. Evidence was found that developers with MBTI type “INTJ” (Introvert, iNtuitive, Thinking, Judging), presented lower levels of depth of inheritance tree (DIT) and “slightly” smaller methods (LOC). As a result, it is clear that further research on the relationship between personality and object-oriented software metrics is needed.},

  abstract={CAS (short for "complex adaptive system") theory advanced by Holland broke through the limitation of previous study on the complex systems from a new visual angle. This paper introduces in detail the origin and development, traits, applications and the meaning on methodologies of the theory. The study of the system complexity is very important in the contemporary scientific study. CAS theory has provided new thinking methods to know, understand, control and manage the complex systems for the researchers. Holland defines the complex adaptive system as such systems that consist of large number of individuals that interact by sending and receiving signals and adapt or learn as they interact. These individuals are called as "adaptive agents" enjoying very large initiative and positivity and the internal mechanism of these agents are defined as the classifier systems. The basic frame of CAS theory includes four characteristics- aggregation, nonlinearity, flow, diversity and three mechanisms- tagging, internal model, building blocks of the adaptive agent, and the stimulus-response model of the agents and Echo Model of the macrosystem. Holland describes them by means of metaphorical method and suggests the computer-based modeling and simulating method should be adopted mainly to study the complex adaptive system.},

  abstract={At the tipping of a paradigm shift in the way energy is produced, transmitted and delivered, the research efforts have not been paralleled by the curricular development. With rapid pace of changes in the field of Smart Grid (SG), the traditional research and educational efforts have been a major domain for electrical engineers. As a mode of discovery and education, interdisciplinarity facilitates broadened perspectives, ability to synthesize, analyze, integrate, and apply knowledge, and out-of-the-box thinking. The major contributions of this paper are discussion of requirements of the educational efforts in SG with special emphasis on multidisciplinarity, survey of the related work, which is the first in the literature to the best of our knowledge, and a discussion of the content for such an effort. A mixed team of power engineers and computer scientists are developing a layered curriculum starting from the introductory material from a variety of SG topics. A distinguishing advantage is the availability of many software tools and the state-of-the-art testbed as a result of years of research.},

  abstract={The first concern when we think about adopting cloud computing is security. Even if, cloud computing seems to be remarkably cheap, the security part might transform the "buzz world" in a terribly expensive technology. The goal of this paper is to present a different perspective of delivering security as a service thru a new defined concept, trust engines. This concept, introduced in this paper, relies on trust management. A trust management system can be achieved in cloud computing by implementing multiple trust models that define what a user can do and what type of protection he has. By identifying the static and dynamic trust models, the cloud provider and the cloud user can have a proper control of the cloud security. A trust model engine could create both static and dynamic rules that will establish a classified profile for all the cloud users.},

  abstract={In an educational institution, various students criteria contributed to the main reason the student is nominated as a model student. This includes cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of academic courses taken, co-curriculum involvement, soft skills, hard work, leadership, attitude, time management, attendance, attire, and technical skill in order to make the selection decision. The distinctive student is identified firstly based on their overall score. The problem arises when one needs to evaluate all these different criteria in order to select or nominated a model student. It is a tedious task and time consuming for examiner or reviewer to analyze students individually in order to select a student that showed desirable performance. In addition, as a human has its limitation, there is a high degree of error in judgment in decision making. With the aim of bridging this gap, fuzzy logic is applied to imitate human analytic thinking or the ability to make a decision in the model student selection process. Thus, the system is able to assist examiner or evaluator in the decision-making process of determining the model student with minimal time and error. Furthermore, the user could dynamically change the criteria based on the traits that have been set by the system. Fuzzy logic is chosen as it is a powerful mathematical tool involving ambiguous and incomplete information supported by the experience and judgment of examiner or reviewer while combining this cognitive ability in order to reach a verdict. Therefore, the outputs from the experiment conducted shows that the system provides robust output and information to the user regarding student's aptitude and ultimately aim to effectively predict human judgment.},

  abstract={Most multimedia servers reported in the literature are designed to serve multiple and independent video/audio streams. We think that, in the future, multimedia servers will also serve complete presentations. A multimedia presentation contains explicitly specified synchronization information describing when each multimedia data needs to be delivered in the playout of the presentation. Multimedia presentations provide unique opportunities to develop algorithms for buffer management and admission control, as execution-time consumption requirements of presentations are known a priori. In this paper, we examine presentations in three different domains (heavyweight, middleweight and lightweight presentations) and provide buffer management and admission control algorithms for the three domains. We propose two improvements (flattening and dynamic adjustments) on the schedules created for the heavyweight presentations. Results from a simulation environment for the proposed algorithms are also presented.},

  abstract={While multicast has been studied extensively in many domains such as content streaming and file sharing, there is little research applying it to synchronous collaborations involving shared access to a distributed object. Based on several cases of real-world collaborations involving instant messaging, distributed lectures, and computationally-intensive collaborative game playing, we show that compared to traditional centralized and replicated collaboration architectures, a new bi-architecture collaboration system model with multicasting support can improve response, feedthrough, and task completion times. In addition, we show that to optimize performance, the set of traditionally considered factors, consisting of network delays and transmission costs, must be expanded to include several new factors, such as processing costs, scheduling policies, and think times. In one or more of the real-world collaborations we consider, we show that multicast (a) can increase feedthrough times if processing costs and scheduling policies are not considered and (b) may degrade or improve task completion times depending on the cost of computing the multicast overlay.},
