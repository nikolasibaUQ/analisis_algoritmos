  abstract={Situation assessment in interactions needs to make an explicit evaluation of the social interactions. When there is more than one agent or ldquoplayerrdquo, the logic of knowledge and belief play an important role. One is interested not only in each personpsilas knowledge and beliefs about substantive matters, but also in his knowledge and beliefs about the others. This paper explored the meta-synthetic computing formula of situation assessment in social interactions. First, each personpsilas knowledge and belief determines the interactive structure, which can be computer-aided calculation. Second, the process of interactions is dynamic, the assessment needs an open interactive environment to analyze and understand the situation, which is human-computer symbiotic. Third, these interactions are supported by the data and information processing algorithm and models. Interactive structure aided by computer, human-computer symbiotic open interactive environment, data and information processing algorithm and models constitute meta-synthetic computing formula of situation assessment.},

  abstract={Although artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the world quickly, training AI models still requires a lot of money and time. This is so because training an AI model needs a lot of data and processing power. A website that allows users to promote their AI model to other users and pay them for sharing their computer resources to help train it is one suggested solution to this problem. A blockchain-based strategy can be used to do this, and it offers numerous advantages such as lower expenses, effective resource pooling, task automation, precise remuneration, and a decrease in administrative overhead. AI models will thereby become more effective, more reasonably priced, and available to a larger variety of individuals and institutions.},

Immune computing, a new kind of intelligent computation approach drawing inspiration from the vertebrate immune system, has strong capabilities of computation. In this paper, some excellent characteristics of immune computing, such as distribution and parallelity, self-organization and self-adaptation, global optimization, robustness, and emergence, are analyzed in detailed to demonstrate that immune computing is a novel research approach for creative design firstly. Next, a scheme of creative design based on immune computing is proposed and corresponding research framework consisting of three levels, i.e. immune computing, creative design and immune creative design, is established. Finally, some key techniques of implementing creative design based on immune computing are briefly discussed.},

  abstract={With quick upgrading of knowledge and high demand for all-round talents at the age of information, the integration of computer multimedia into college English course has altered traditional teaching model. The teaching focus is converted to learning process from content; teacher becomes the organizer and manager of class, the director and supervisor of students instead of the lecturer; students become active and autonomous learners instead of passive receivers. Meanwhile, their collaborative skills and communication styles are improved in the so-called computer-assist teaching model. All in all, this student-centered interactive environment contributes to the improvement of the students' comprehensive English skills. The present authors intend to compare the two models, put forward concrete methods to apply this computer-assist teaching model to college English teaching and some constructive suggestions to the improvement of this new model.},

  abstract={A considerable body of research examines people's perceptions of the nature of science. There is also extensive research about what those perceptions are for teachers, and what strategies can be used to change them. There is, however, very little information about what these perceptions may be in the case of computer science. In fact, computer scientists struggle to agree on a definition of their discipline, and perhaps the only term common term to all existing definitions is that of computational thinking. This paper reports on an investigation into perceptions about computer science occurred during a series of professional development workshops for Australian Digital Technologies teachers. These workshops aimed to promote the computer science discipline by providing skills and resources necessary to teach computer science and computational thinking. The results of our investigation indicate that Digital Technologies teachers in our sample (N=16) had one common misconception about the nature of computer science. We also found that the misconception was changed after 3 days of intensive education about computational thinking, computer science and its applications.},

  abstract={Many important real-world decision making problems involve group interactions among individuals with purely informational externalities, such situations arise for example in jury deliberations, expert committees, medical diagnosis, etc. In this paper, we will use the framework of iterated eliminations to model the decision problem as well as the thinking process of a Bayesian agent in a group decision/discussion scenario. We model the purely informational interactions of rational agents in a group, where they receive private information and act based upon that information while also observing other people's beliefs. As the Bayesian agent attempts to infer the true state of the world from her sequence of observations which include her neighbors' beliefs as well as her own private signal, she recursively refines her belief about the signals that other players could have observed and beliefs that they would have hold given the assumption that other players are also rational. We further analyze the computational complexity of the Bayesian belief formation in groups and show that it is MV-hard. We also investigate the factors underlying this computational complexity and show how belief calculations simplify in special network structures or cases with strong inherent symmetries. We finally give insights about the statistical efficiency (optimality) of the beliefs and its relations to computational efficiency.},

  pages={2446-2459},
  abstract={This paper presents a graph processing based traffic estimation system, GPTE, which is able to achieve high accuracy and high scalability to support city scale traffic estimation. GPTE benefits from its non-linear traffic correlation modeling and the graph-parallel processing framework built on clustered machines. By representing the road network as a property graph, GPTE decomposes the numerous computations involved in non-linear models to vertices and performs traffic estimation via neural network modeling and iterative information propagation. This paper presents our experiences in designing and implementing GPTE on top of the Spark, an emerging cluster computing framework. Extensive experiments are performed with real-world data input from Singapore's transport authority. Experimental results show that GPTE achieves as high as 88 percent accuracy in traffic estimation and up to 8× performance gain in computation efficiency with the optimization techniques applied. Comparison study demonstrates that GPTE outperforms the baseline solutions by 34 percent on accuracy and 46 percent on processing time.},

  year={2016},
  volume={},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={This paper describes an on-line approach for estimating non-rigid shape and camera pose from monocular video sequences. We assume an initial estimate of the shape at rest to be given and represented by a triangulated mesh, which is encoded by a matrix of the distances between every pair of vertexes. By applying spectral analysis on this matrix, we are then able to compute a low-dimensional shape basis, that in contrast to standard approaches, has a very direct physical interpretation and requires a much smaller number of modes to span a large variety of deformations, either for inextensible or extensible configurations. Based on this low-rank model, we then sequentially retrieve both camera motion and non-rigid shape in each image, optimizing the model parameters with bundle adjustment over a sliding window of image frames. Since the number of these parameters is small, specially when considering physical priors, our approach may potentially achieve real-time performance. Experimental results on real videos for different scenarios demonstrate remarkable robustness to artifacts such as missing and noisy observations.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={This paper investigates the emotional reasoning abilities of the GPT family of large language models. We advocate a component perspective on evaluation that decomposes models into different aspects of emotional reasoning (appraisal derivation, affect/intensity derivation, and consequent derivation). We report two studies. A correlational study examines how the model reasons about autobiographical memories. An experimental study systematically varies aspects of situations in ways previously shown to impact emotion intensity and coping tendencies. Results demonstrate, even without prompt engineering, GPT predictions closely match human-provided appraisals and emotion labels, though GPT struggled to predict emotion intensity and coping responses. GPT-4 performed best on the first study but performed poorly on the second (though it yielded the best results following minor prompt engineering). The evaluation raises questions about how to utilize the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses of such models, including dealing with variability in responses. More fundamentally, these studies highlight the benefits of the componential perspective on model evaluation.},

  abstract={By thinking of a society as a cognitive system, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for artificial social intelligence. This framework is implemented using Knowledge Request-Broker Architecture, and its applicability is experienced in the field of system identification by letting a society of self-interested agents, with various skills, to identify a system based on given training data. To develop a theory about how social intelligence works, two questions were asked. First, “What was changed in time that made less intelligent societies to become more intelligent?”, and second “what drives individuals to take part in social productiveness?”. The framework reported in this paper is inspired by the answers given to these question through the study of the emergence of human civilizations, and putting it beside computer and knowledge engineering concepts. The experiments with this system show how social ensemble of simple autonomous agents can solve harder problems, while demonstrating the practicality of the proposed framework and its associated API.},

  abstract={Although there have been many advances in end-user programming environments, recent empirical studies report that programming still remains difficult for end-users. We hypothesize that one reason may be lack of effective support for helping end-user programmers problem-solve their own way around barriers they encounter. Therefore, in this paper, we describe the Idea Garden, a concept designed to help end-user programmers generate new ideas and problem-solve when they run into barriers. The Idea Garden has its roots in Minimalist Learning Theory and problem-solving theories. Our proof-of-concept prototype of the Idea Garden concept in the CoScripter end-user programming environment currently targets three barriers reported in end-user programming literature. It does so using an integrated, just-in-time combination of scaffolding for problem-solving strategies, for design patterns and for programming concepts. Our empirical results showed that this approach helped end-user programmers overcome all three types of barriers that our prototype targeted.},

  abstract={With the growing need for STEM workers in the job market, schools tend to look for extra-curricular activities that promote this type of skills. With activities like The Inventors or Happy Code, schools encourage kids to have a mindset more open towards technology. Despite these efforts, the tools available to teach programming to primary school students are still lacking. Available solutions can be too difficult to understand, overly expensive for school budgets or may require IT infrastructure that is lacking from the majority of public schools. As a result, this paper aims to create a concept that can convey the fundamentals of programming/Logical Thinking in an accessible and fun way, without using a computer.

  abstract={Computational thinking is considered critical for learning to code in K-12 education standards. The logic-first, syntax-later argument has been instrumental in promoting block-based languages such as Snap! and Scratch with limited success. In contrast, we believe that expressing the logic of computational problems in the student’s language is more convenient and natural. In such an environment, learners will experience the least impedance mismatch between their conceptual view and the target code they write. In this paper, a new natural language-based programming system, called TryPL (Try Programming in Logic), is introduced and discussed. We demonstrate that TryPL helps to identify gaps in logic and assists in validating learners’ mental models of abstract algorithms. An argument is also made as to why using a natural language-based programming environment and a learning model to teach computational thinking could be more effective and appealing to K-12 and first-year college students.},

  abstract={Existing cognitive models of narrative creation provide accounts for story invention that, while useful, are too high level to be directly applied to formal systems like computational models of narrative generation. Inversely, existing automatic story generation systems that try to implement cognitive models can only rely on approximations to the general concepts these models describe. In order to provide insight to fill the gap between these two approaches, we have conducted a study in which human participants would invent and write short stories while reflecting on their thoughts out loud. The sessions and the analysis of the recordings was designed so that we could observe which specific modifications the participants apply to their story drafts, with the intention to inform the process of creating computational systems based on cognitive descriptions of the narrative creation process. After running the experiments, annotating the videos and analysing the output, we have concluded that there are a number of common modifications that humans tend to apply to a newly created draft, and that this information can be used to the development of storytelling systems.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI), usually referred to as machine intelligence, is a scientific field that gives robots the ability to think like people. AI is a term used to describe a system that simulates human intellect using computer programming. AI is advancing quickly in many multidisciplinary fields, including ophthalmology, from healthcare to the accurate preventive measures, investigation, and treatment plans of illnesses. Because of the emphasis on imaging in the diagnosis of eye illnesses, optometry and ophthalmology is at the forefront of AI in medical field and medicine. Lately, the most prevalent illnesses that cause blindness and visual impairment, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), have been subjected to deep learning-based AI screening and predictive algorithm models. Deep learning machine with algorithms are the computer models made up of several layers of simulated neurons, are largely responsible for the success of AI in medical field and medicine. These models are capable of learning how data is represented at various levels of abstraction. The trained AI system classified the various forms of DR on optical coherence tomography pictures with accuracy equivalent to that of human specialists. In this study, we focus on the core ideas of AI and how it is applied to the various forms of DR. We also go into further detail on how AI and DL are used in the future of ophthalmology.},

In previous papers we introduced the computational information conservation theory (CICT) approach to get more effective and reliable cognitive, biophysical, and biomedical engineering simulation solutions. CICT new computational information conservation awareness can open the way for a paradigm shift to recover lost coherence information in system description and to develop even advanced quantum cognitive systems. To achieve this result, in present paper, we show the fundamental pre-spatial geometro-arithmetic scheme defining optimized numeric word generators and relations to minimize the traditional multiscale statistic modeling veil opacity and information entropy generation. It is the first, fundamental step to an effective progression from computing with numbers to computing with numeric words with precisation of their meaning. This paper is a relevant contribution towards an effective and convenient “Science 2.0” universal computational framework to achieve deeper cognitive intelligence at your fingertips and beyond.},

  abstract={Memory and storage are important elements in consumer electronic devices. They retain data for immediate and delayed processing, and they store the results of processing for later retrieval. All consumer devices use some type of volatile and nonvolatile memory along with processing and communication. Memory and processing have been separate operations using distinct devices; however, there are products becoming available that combine processing power in storage devices, and there is work underway to create processing in close association with digital storage (often called computational storage) or even using technologies where processing is in very close association with nonvolatile memories (in-memory computing). Some emerging memory technologies even have characteristics that can mimic the operations of neurons in the brain and are being used for neuromorphic computing. Let's take a look at developments that bring processing and memory/storage together in new ways to enable smarter consumer devices.},

  abstract={Problem solving tests associated with convergent thinking are often used to analyze the creative ability of an individual. Such tests consist of problems whose solution can be reached by an analytical or a creative insight based approach. Detection of creative individuals amongst others undertaking such tests is thus quite challenging since a correct response to the presented problem can be reached using two different cognitive styles. The paper attempts to address a solution to this issue using EEG analysis system. The proposed technique intends to classify the two cognitive styles involved in solving convergent problems with the main motivation of selecting creative individuals amongst other examinees. Moreover, the proposed strategy also attempts to highlight the creative ability of every selected creative individual under three levels: low, medium or high. In other words, the present scheme aims to distinguish creative subjects along with their levels of creative ability from the analytical ones.The procurement of EEG signals from the subjects engaged in the problem solving test are fed to a novel attention induced capsule network to categorize the desired class labels after undergoing the pre-processing and feature extraction phases. Performance analysis undertaken confirms the superlative behavior of the proposed classifier over the state-of-the-art techniques. Thus, the proposed scheme can find its applications in the recruitment of creative individuals in various strata of organizations linked with creation and innovation such as advertising, business, engineering and the like.},

  abstract={Computational thinking and coding has received considerable attention over the past several years. Considerable efforts worldwide suggest the need for more empirical studies providing evidence-based practices to introduce and engage children with coding activities. The main goal of this study is to examine which programming concepts students use when they want to develop a game, and what is the interrelation among these concepts. To achieve our goal, a field study was designed and data were collected from coding activities. In detail, during a two-week period, one-day workshops were organized almost every day on which 44 children participating in, with ages between 8-17. The workshops follow a constructionist approach and comprise of two parts. First the children interact with robots, and then develop a game using Scratch. The findings provide a deeper understanding on how children code by showing the use of specific programming concepts to develop their projects and their correlations. Hence, we improve our knowledge about children's competences in coding.},

  abstract={According to the US Bureau of Labor and Statistics the job outlook for computer scientists and engineers is stellar for the long term-President Obama and industry leaders encouraged colleges to graduate 10,000 more engineers a year. Computer science and engineering salaries are high, but yet it is unlikely that the number of technology majors will meet the projected demand. Sadly, for many students their first college computer science or engineering course is their last. This is particularly true for women and other under-represented groups. Over the last 20 years, we have tried to increase enrollment and retention by embedding embedded systems throughout our computer science curriculum. This year, we have extended that effort to a general education course that satisfies our campus' art and diversity requirements. Creative Fabrication demonstrates the creativity inherent in computer science and engineering through the implementation of three art projects: 1) an LED enabled sculpture representing disability, 2) a moving sculpture representing disability, and 3) a sculptural assistive technology solution designed for a specific disability. All projects connect technology to differently abled human beings via computational crafting - fabricating aesthetically pleasing and functional works.},
