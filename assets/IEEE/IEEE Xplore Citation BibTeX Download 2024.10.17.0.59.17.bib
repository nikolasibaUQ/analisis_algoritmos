  abstract={Health care is the improvement of health through the avoidance and cure of diseases. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) poses a substantial health issue, ranking as the eighth leading cause of death and the tenth leading cause of disability-adjusted life years for both genders. This research aims to utilize machine learning (ML) algorithms to accurately predict the presence of CKD, which affects people worldwide. Timely identification of CKD is crucial to prevent it from progressing to its final and most critical phase. Machine learning algorithms, such as Decision Tree (DT), Naïve Bayes (NB), and others, are used in this study for the prediction of CKD. Various health parameters such as age, albumin level, and more are used as input into each ML algorithm to predict the presence of CKD. Data preprocessing is carried out to improve the quality of the data for more accurate prediction. The data is analyzed to uncover the connections between CKD health parameters and their impact on the occurrence of CKD. This research further examines the influence of different train and test data ratios on the accuracy of the employed algorithms. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and more are employed to gauge the effectiveness of each algorithm in making predictions. Random Forest stood out as the most accurate algorithm, with a score of 96.25%. Naive Bayes and XGBoost demonstrated the highest sensitivity, achieving a perfect score of 100%.},

  abstract={Recent developments in computational freeform inverse design have provided a fertile landscape of structures and topologies for nanophotonics. However, simply dumping millions of parameters into a simulation can easily lead to intractable computational problems. Fortunately, a given engineering problem often admits many different mathematical formulations, and by carefully matching the formulation to the available electromagnetic solvers and optimization algorithms one can set the stage for extraordinarily flexible automated design. In this talk, we will show that, with careful consideration and reformulation of the design problem, powerful inverse design techniques can be successfully applied to a multitude of interesting problems with rich physical behavior, ranging from light confinement in nonlinear multi-resonant cavities, robust bandgap maximization in 3D photonic crystals to beam-forming and manipulation through multi-layered metasurfaces.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={This study demonstrates the utilization of Machine Learning (ML) for network slice prediction, enabling the optimization of resources for diverse network slices. Traditional methods for network slice prediction often lack efficiency and result in inaccuracies. By leveraging ML algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Random Forest, an intelligent framework that automates network slice prediction is developed. This framework enhances network virtualization and management, facilitating resource allocation. The ML algorithms take real-time network conditions and usages, such as packet delay and smart city, as input and output for selecting the most suitable network slice. Data analysis is further conducted to reveal the connections between the input parameters and how these parameters influence the selection of the accurate network slice. Network slicing plays a crucial role as it enables the customization of services and facilitates efficient scaling to meet the specific needs of different applications and industries. The accuracy scores of the employed ML algorithms were generally perfect, except for the KNN and SVM classifiers, which achieved an accuracy of 94.30% and 92.16%, respectively, for the prediction of network slices based on incoming network connections and usages.},

  volume={8},
  number={},
  pages={146263-146283},
  abstract={Many works have been done in an effort to create systems for automatic generation of creative culinary recipes. Although most of them are related to the recipe ingredient lists, few works have been done to evaluate and generate the preparation steps of culinary recipes. This work proposes the use of statistical Language Models, as well as the perplexity metric, for the generation of culinary recipes. In this work, we also developed a system for automatic generation of creative culinary recipes using two approaches: one based on a genetic programming algorithm guided by the proposed language model; and the other based on a decomposition of existing recipes and recomposition of new recipes through a genetic algorithm guided by the proposed language model. This second approach achieved the best results. For this approach, a total of 6 recipes were generated to evaluate, through an online survey, the influence of the Language Model in the generation of recipes with better use of secondary ingredients, oils and seasonings, throughout the preparation steps. In the comparison between these two groups of recipes, the respondents considered the recipes generated using the language model as having the best quality, presenting an average evaluation of 63.6% of the scale (i.e. between medium and good use of oils and seasonings compared to recipes from the other group). In addition, a recipe from this approach was cooked and tasted for taste assessment, obtaining an average evaluation of 93% of the scale.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={0707-0711},
  abstract={The four quantum phenomena of superposition, entanglement, tunneling, and annealing are envisioned to give quantum computing the ability to solve complex problems in very low-resolution times as compared with classical computers. These four phenomena are closely related to the light-based properties of presence, knowledge, power, and harmony, central to a multilayered light-based model of reality that also offers alternative foundation for thinking about quanta and quantum computation. In this model, it is not a random process from infinite superposed possibilities that exist at the quantum-level as supposed by the Copenhagen Interpretation, and as assumed as the foundation of the infinite processing capability of quantum objects by contemporary pioneers of quantum computing. Rather, the infinite processing capability is due to a more ordered display of superposition, entanglement, tunneling and annealing: superposition, as an ordered concord of light's property of presence stacked in logical arrangement by layer of light; entanglement, as a display of light's property of knowledge that occurs at a speed faster than the known speed of light; tunneling, as a display of light's property of power that allows toggling between different “realities” in layers of light; and annealing, expressing light's property of harmony, to find an ideal minimum state among a number of realities. These four quantum phenomena derivative from an implicit and natural unity within light, engineered to maintain that unity externally, will confer quantum computation with the possibility of extraordinary processing power.},

  abstract={When we build systems to operate in hazardous or remote environments, and especially when we expect them to cooperate with others in support of a goal, we rely on them to operate as correctly as possible in the (unpredicted, frequently unpredictable) situations they encounter. But the environment does whatever it does; we have essentially no control and only limited knowledge of what it does, and only the most meager notion of what it will do. In this paper, we describe an architecture for these component systems that we think will be better suited to the vagaries of environmental behavior than others. We advocate a collection of subsidiary systems to operate in parallel with the main system, to act as “outriggers” for unexpected environmental behaviors or system failures, or as “training wheels” during development.. We describe our initial notions of how they relate to the original system and how to implement them.},

  abstract={This Research Full Paper presents the effects of our weeklong Professional Development class on the programming skills of nineteen high school teachers, their confidence in programming, and their confidence for teaching programming. A primary objective of the CS10K and CS For All initiatives is the education of K-12 teachers in aspects of computer science and computational thinking so they can teach CS courses in their schools. Many of these educators have degrees in disciplines other than computer science, such as math, science, and business, so preparing them to teach CS is a challenge, particularly since most K-12 teachers have limited time to devote to learning new curriculum. This study describes how we managed a short course in computational thinking and programming to a group of high school teachers. We illustrate through survey data assessment and evaluation that significant gains in skill level and self-efficacy can be realized within a short but intensive week of face-to-face training. Five months later we follow-up with the same cohort to see if earlier achievements remain evident over time. Discussion throughout the paper identifies strengths and weaknesses of the training week, which is useful to others planning to undertake similar PD offerings.},

  title={Adapting an OER Textbook for the Inverted Classroom Model — How To Flip the Classroom with BBC micro:bit Example Tasks}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Full Paper Research-to-Practice The current COVID-19 crisis has created significant challenges for schools. The growing importance of “flipping the classroom” and the needful emphasizing of online-learning were owed to the situation. To meet these requirements, materials and tasks must be adapted. The Open Educational Resource (OER) textbook “Computational Thinking with the BBC micro:bit” was developed for the introduction of Computational Thinking (CT) for 10-14-year-old pupils in Austria's secondary schools. Example tasks in the textbook are designed with an open end and present extensions with ideas for further development instead of ending abruptly. This article provides a guideline for a clear distinction in redesigning existing lessons following the Inverted Classroom Model (ICM) using videos for pre-class work and live task extensions for in-class work. Which parts in the learning design must remain as live lessons and which parts can be adapted for video lessons? The respective research shows that examples that have a makerspace activity as an extension are especially helpful for an efficient determination of the appropriate part in the learning design and particularly suitable for an adaptation with ICM. The central advantage of the ICM is that it responds flexibly to the individual learning needs of each student. It allows students to take their time reviewing the material at their own pace without getting left behind. The textbook used here encourages pupils to find their own solutions by explorative learning using the block-based programming environment MakeCode. Additional information to be uncovered by the learner is provided for every single step in the accompanying online wiki website. Results from observations showed that this uncover-function, being a central element of the online material, encouraged the learners to explore their own way in finding a solution with playful elements and increased motivation. The many haptic elements of a makerspace activity are in particular useful for consolidation of the learned and are predisposed for in-class work and deepening the understanding following the constructionism theory. A Design-Based Research (DBR) approach is used to create and evaluate the redesign of a proven example task in a pilot project. Teachers, who are already familiar with the BBC micro:bit and the OER textbook, were trained on how to use the “flip-version” of an example task in their lessons and asked to develop a lesson plan for implementation. The didactic approach to redesigning the material and teacher training was evaluated during the first cycle of DBR. Results from expert interviews showed that the redesigned material and training deliver a solid ground for rework and further research on a larger scale.},

  abstract={While block-based programming has successfully eliminated critical syntactic barriers to programming, it remains unclear how effectively it aids in overcoming semantic, logical, and pragmatic programming challenges that hinder computational thinking. These challenges are likely to far outweigh the syntactic ones. With the goal of creating a highly accessible programming tool for young students using mobile devices, we explored the concept of pragmatic prebugging to begin addressing these challenges. By pragmatic prebugging, we refer to proactive debugging tools designed to prevent logical errors. This article introduces RULER.game as a Computational Thinking Tool with built-in pragmatic prebugging, enabling novice programmers to create games through a paradigm we call proxy-based programming. A small study exploring error rates found statistically significant performance improvements of proxy-based programming compared to block-based programming.},

To get a clear picture of what work has been proposed in the literature, we present a survey article that gathers information about various propagation models used and proposed for maritime environment. We analyze each work based on the simulation set up, number of factors considered, error differences between simulated and experimental data and so on. We believe this article will help to identify the current state in simulation and analysis of communication links over the sea environment.},

The resources of the production plant are modelled in order to enable the simulation of their functionalities. A smart control system is developed, aiming to gather machine data, both from the machine controller and the external sensors, before providing them as input to the simulation tool. The outcome of the simulation is the prediction of the machine's health status, which then is used for the identification of the machine's maintenance activities. Efficient algorithms and technologies for data analysis and prediction are utilized. In this way, the condition and the status of the machines can be predicted as a result from the simulation of physically-based models, without the machines' operation being stopped, as it happens in the common predictive maintenance solutions.},

  abstract={AI systems have seen significant adoption in various domains. At the same time, further adoption in some domains is hindered by the inability to fully trust an AI system that it will not harm a human. Besides, fairness, privacy, transparency, and explainability are vital to developing trust in AI systems. As stated in Describing Trustworthy AI,aa.https://www.ibm.com/watson/trustworthy-ai. “Trust comes through understanding. How AI-led decisions are made and what determining factors were included are crucial to understand.” The subarea of explaining AI systems has come to be known as XAI. Multiple aspects of an AI system can be explained; these include biases that the data might have, lack of data points in a particular region of the example space, fairness of gathering the data, feature importances, etc. However, besides these, it is critical to have human-centered explanations directly related to decision-making, similar to how a domain expert makes decisions based on “domain knowledge,” including well-established, peer-validated explicit guidelines. To understand and validate an AI system's outcomes (such as classification, recommendations, predictions) that lead to developing trust in the AI system, it is necessary to involve explicit domain knowledge that humans understand and use. Contemporary XAI methods are yet addressed explanations that enable decision-making similar to an expert. Figure 1 shows the stages of adoption of an AI system into the real world.},

  abstract={Plagiarism is known as illegal use of others' part of work or whole work as one's own in any field such as art, poetry, literature, cinema, research and other creative forms of study. Plagiarism is one of the important issues in academic and research fields and giving more concern in academic systems. The situation is even worse with the availability of ample resources on the web. This paper focuses on an effective plagiarism detection tool on identifying suitable intra-corpal plagiarism detection for text based assignments by comparing unigram, bigram, trigram of vector space model with cosine similarity measure. Manually evaluated, labelled dataset was tested using unigram, bigram and trigram vector. Even though trigram vector consumes comparatively more time, it shows better results with the labelled data. In addition, the selected trigram vector space model with cosine similarity measure is compared with tri-gram sequence matching technique with Jaccard measure. In the results, cosine similarity score shows slightly higher values than the other. Because, it focuses on giving more weight for terms that do not frequently exist in the dataset and cosine similarity measure using trigram technique is more preferable than the other. Therefore, we present our new tool and it could be used as an effective tool to evaluate text based electronic assignments and minimize the plagiarism among students.},

  abstract={Emotions have been shown to have an important role on several human processes such as decision-making, planning, cognition, and, in particular, learning. However, many e-learning systems disregard the emotional aspects of the learning process and the impact of these aspects on the student's performance. The paper presents an intelligent agent with synthesized emotions that influence its beliefs, desires, and intentions in order to drive the agent behavior. Based on this model, we propose an artificial tutor, integrated in an e-learning system, which develops lectures plans and tailors its behavior towards the student according to the student reactions and his/her presumed affective states.},

  abstract={Model driven architecture (MDA) is a software development framework based on automatic transformations of models. The first of these models, the computation independent model (CIM), is used to define the business system, and it is usually represented with UML models. Natural language is widely used in requirements engineering as it is generally understandable by stakeholders encouraging their participation. Therefore, in order to enhance the first stages of MDA software development, we propose to define natural language oriented requirements models and derive from them a CIM. To achieve this integration we describe in this paper an automatic process to derive a business class diagram representing the structural aspects of a CIM starting from natural language oriented models.},

  abstract={A novel modeling method is presented for knowledge intensive representation of engineering objects in product model in order to establish product-wide coordinated decision making during lifecycle of product. The currently prevailing product model space is extended by entities representing human affect driven change attempt, product behavior, change affect zone, and contextual change chain. The purpose of this modeling is utilization of possibilities offered by integrated application of sophisticated product modeling and intelligent engineering in order to establish a contribution to find solution for an actual product model related problem in communication between engineers. This problem has been emerged by the new style of engineering where cooperating humans use product model as a medium. The extended model is called as virtual engineering space. Term engineering space refers to the emphasis on serving engineering processes in virtual space. In this paper, definition of key concepts and placing the research in related works are followed by characterization of current virtual product spaces and the related engineering methods. Main contribution of the paper explains a three sectored multilevel model of product and application of this concept at definition of virtual engineering space. Finally, a human intent based process for decision making on product object parameters is explained as an example for application of the proposed virtual engineering space.},

  abstract={Different people may have a different learning styles and it is important to provide the most suitable content and course materials for learning. However, determining the learning style may be difficult due to limited information about the learner and lack of a learner profile. The learner has to complete a questionnaire form based on educational theory in order to determine the learning style. Moreover, it is necessary to know the learner's study record related to other factors such as demographic factors. Therefore, an enhanced model to identify learning style is needed. This research aims to address the problem of identifying the learning style for a new student. A learning style classification model was proposed and ensemble classification techniques were implemented. The results showed that the proposed ensemble classification techniques performed better compared to other classification techniques used in the experiment.},
