  abstract={Recent advances in planning techniques have focused on online search techniques. While these techniques allow practitioners to obtain policies for fairly large problems, they assume that a non-negligible amount of computation can be done between each decision point. In contrast, the recent proliferation of mobile and embedded devices has lead to a surge of applications that could benefit from state of the art planning techniques if they can operate under severe constraints on computational resources. For instance, consider the emerging class of monitoring and assistive applications that run on smart-phones, wearable systems or other mobile devices. While computational resources are rapidly increasing, energy consumption remains an important bottleneck due to limited battery life. In this talk, I will present some experiments about battery consumption for various types of planning policies on smart-phones. I will then present recent results for the optimization and compilation of policies into controllers with negligible energy consumption during their execution. I will also present recent advances in multi-objective optimization to tradeoff the utility and energy costs resulting from different actions.},

  abstract={The papers in this special section focus on smart fuzzy optimization in operational research and renewable energy. Over the last five decades, fuzzy optimization has found numerous successful applications in diverse fields, including operational research (OR), manufacturing, information technology, energy optimization, data science, smart cities, and big data analytics. Fuzzy optimization has strongly influenced research and development into other areas of intelligent computing leading to many hybrid and deep learning systems. It has opened new horizons in thinking, research and development and it will guide us into another half century of progress. In actually, fuzzy optimization is an approximation of nonlinear optimization, which has formed a systematic but not yet unified theory of fuzzy systems and other fuzzy-set based methodologies. Fuzzy optimization along with decision making is an interdisciplinary area, which focuses on extracting useful knowledge with data technology and employing it. Specific topics include fuzzy sets, rough sets, statistical methods, parallel/distributed data mining, hybrid fuzzy optimization, hybrid evolutionary and swarm intelligence methods, big data optimization, IoTs, flexibility, reliability and robustness, smart systems, high-dimensional and big-data analytics, energy optimization, and software engineering. },

As the author explains, there has been a change of paradigm associated with AI: From the original idea to create machines able to think as we do, to machines able to get trained by data-driven approaches based on statistics, and to make it so effectively as to give us the idea they are really thinking as we do. In a nutshell, machine learning (ML) has been our shortcut towards AI.},

  abstract={Attractive reverberation imaging is a clinical thinking system that utilizations radio waves and a solid visual field to make explicit transmissions of tissues and organs. Examining mental development is frequently utilized. Cancer in the cerebrum is a group of cells that replicate and grow strangely. Growth is made up of unwanted cells, which may be found in different parts of the brain, for example, the skull, arteries, glial cells, neurons, lymphatic tissue or metastasize from cancers found in different organs. When in doubt, development can be characterized into two classes, for instance, undermining (cancer-causing) and innocuous (non- destructive). The disruptive proof and ID of cerebrum development is incredible for MRI to imagine, nonetheless, the drawn-out and frightening work performed by clinical experts. This paper introduces systematic brain collection of MRI and recognition using differentiation (k-implies). The recommended strategy covers several stages. The recommended technique comprises a few phases, for example, preprocessing, filtration, and wavelet changes highlight extraction division and grouping. Here, the Median sifting strategy is used to preprocess the given picture for eliminating the commotion and afterward apply DWT to remove the GLCM highlights and grouping division to track down the growth region restriction.

  abstract={There are many challenges to creating artificial intelligence systems. There are limited resources, insufficient knowledge in the field, feasibility, and many other technical problems on the way to creating AI. Artificial Intelligence currently remains a scientific field related to computer modeling of human intellectual functions. Artificial intelligence systems are generally used to refer to a computer system's ability to perform tasks that are intrinsic to human intelligence, such as logical inference and learning tasks. Any task whose solution algorithm is not known in advance or whose data are incomplete can be classified as an AI task. Systems, programs performing actions to solve a task can be classified as AI if their activity is similar to the result of a human in solving the same task. Therefore, a number of software means can be referred to as AI: text recognition systems, automated design, self-training programs, etc. But not only for this reason, but also because they operate on similar principles to humans. There are two main promising directions in AI research. The first is to bring AI systems closer to the principles of human thinking. The second is to create AI representing the integration of already developed AI systems into a single system capable of solving human problems.},

  title={Magnetotelluric 3-D inversion—a review of two successful workshops on forward and inversion code testing and comparison}, 
  year={2013},
  volume={193},
  number={3},
  pages={1216-1238},
  abstract={Over the last half decade the need for, and importance of, three-dimensional (3-D) modelling of magnetotelluric (MT) data have increased dramatically and various 3-D forward and inversion codes are in use and some have become commonly available. Comparison of forward responses and inversion results is an important step for code testing and validation prior to ‘production’ use. The various codes use different mathematical approximations to the problem (finite differences, finite elements or integral equations), various orientations of the coordinate system, different sign conventions for the time dependence and various inversion strategies. Additionally, the obtained results are dependent on data analysis, selection and correction as well as on the chosen mesh, inversion parameters and regularization adopted, and therefore, a careful and knowledge-based use of the codes is essential. In 2008 and 2011, during two workshops at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies over 40 people from academia (scientists and students) and industry from around the world met to discuss 3-D MT inversion. These workshops brought together a mix of code writers as well as code users to assess the current status of 3-D modelling, to compare the results of different codes, and to discuss and think about future improvements and new aims in 3-D modelling. To test the numerical forward solutions, two 3-D models were designed to compare the responses obtained by different codes and/or users. Furthermore, inversion results of these two data sets and two additional data sets obtained from unknown models (secret models) were also compared. In this manuscript the test models and data sets are described (supplementary files are available) and comparisons of the results are shown. Details regarding the used data, forward and inversion parameters as well as computational power are summarized for each case, and the main discussion points of the workshops are reviewed. In general, the responses obtained from the various forward models are comfortingly very similar, and discrepancies are mainly related to the adopted mesh. For the inversions, the results show how the inversion outcome is affected by distortion and the choice of errors, as well as by the completeness of the data set. We hope that these compilations will become useful not only for those that were involved in the workshops, but for the entire MT community and also the broader geoscience community who may be interested in the resolution offered by MT.},

Research advances in multimedia information processing, computer vision and pattern recognition have lead to established methodologies that are able to successfully recognize consciously executed actions, or intended movements (e.g., gestures, actions, interactions with objects and other people). However, recently there has been much progress in terms of computational approaches to characterize sub-conscious behaviors, which may be revealing aptitudes or competence, hidden intentions, and personality traits. Much remains to be done still, but it is essential nowadays to have a compilation of cutting edge work in this direction to identify potential opportunities and challenges involved. In this line, we edited a special issue on automatic methods for apparent personality analysis.

  volume={53},
  number={2},
  pages={20-21},
  abstract={Bees are important: they pollinate dozens of crops, including almonds, cacao, and coffee. While there has been a lot of attention paid to Western honeybees owing to colony collapse disorder, this specific disease and others like it are really measurable only once a colony collapses. And in any case, honeybees are not the only important bee pollinators. What we need is the ability to measure and monitor bee activity as it happens. - Historically, such monitoring was the purview of undergraduates armed with clipboards. More recently, optical sensors have allowed for the automatic detection of bees entering and exiting the hive. But placing optical sensors in a habitat of pollen, mud, and other hive debris drastically degrades their effectiveness. What if there was a better way? - A solution suggested itself when the two of us--a field applications engineer for Analog Devices and an amateur bee enthusiast--were working together on a previous project that involved capacitive sensing. Teachman (the bee enthusiast) commented to Perrault (the applications engineer) that the sensitivity of the AD7746 capacitance-to-digital conversion chip was better than he had expected, and wondered, "Do you think we could measure bees with this?" All else being equal, the capacitance between two electrodes depends on the dielectric constant of the substance between them. Air has a dielectric constant of roughly 1, while water comes in at around 80. As living cells are mostly water, a bee should have a detectable dielectric signature. Intrigued by the idea, we developed a custom sensor setup to measure just that.},

Her extensive academic, research, and industry experiences, as well as her training in both economics and mathematics, make her highly qualified to provide fresh thinking in this important area. The book proposes the adoption of swing contracts between the system operator and relevant resources to provide flexibility. This flexibility is represented in the form of future availability of dispatchable power paths (“reserve”) with prespecified physical attributes and economic attributes (for pricing purposes).

  abstract={Summary form only given. A scenario is a meaningful sequence of events. For the decision of human, it is essential to create valuable scenarios of the future and choose one to realize. This talk is composed of two topics: (1) computational methods for visualizing a scenario map: a figure visualizing the relations between events, on which humans can think about scenarios. The obtained scenarios can be regarded as patterns of event occurrences in the past or beneficial plans to be executed in the future. (2) Human's competencies for sensing a (or a sequence of) valuable event, and new criteria for evaluating the value of forthcoming events. We have been studying this talent from the viewpoint of cognitive science and business management.},
