  abstract={As the resolution of simulation models increases, scientific visualization algorithms which take advantage of the large memory and parallelism of massively parallel processors (MPPs) are becoming increasingly important. For large applications, rendering on an MPP tends to be preferable to rendering on a graphics workstation, due to the MPP's abundant resources: memory, disk and numerous processors. The challenge is developing algorithms that can exploit these resources while minimizing overheads, typically communication costs. This paper describes recent efforts in parallel rendering for polygonal primitives as well as parallel volumetric techniques. It presents rendering algorithms, developed for MPPs, for polygonal, spherical and volumetric data. The polygon algorithm uses a data-parallel approach, whereas the sphere and volume rendering use a MIMD approach. Implementations for these algorithms are presented for a Thinking Machines Corp. CM-5 and a Cray Research Inc. T3D.},

  pages={207-210},
  abstract={Electric vehicles represent a promising choice to decrease pollution and reducing fossil fuel consumption. However, their limited autonomy poses a challenge that prevents them from being suitable for many car users. Several practical solutions are sought to avoid this problem, in particular one may think of enhancing the battery capacity, reducing the charging time, or increasing the frequency of charging points. In this paper, we discuss how these aspects can be integrated by a proper Markov model, thereby offering a neat analytical solution to investigate all these problems. Some preliminary results are also shown to demonstrate the descriptiveness of the model. Further investigation can frame the proposed contribution within an optimization framework, maintaining an analytical context.},

  abstract={Sentiment Analysis is the process of getting people’s ideas on what they think or feel about a particular issue or product or a person and classifying the information expressed about an issue in a positive, negative or a neutral manner. This extracted information can be found very much useful in determining popularity of a person or a product and they are very much useful in ecommerce in suggesting products to buy and in social media like YouTube in suggesting videos to view. Mostly people express their views and share their thoughts in their mother Tongue along with usage of mixed language words is common nowadays. Hence Sentiment analysis of codemixed language plays a major role. There is only little work available in Tamil mixed Sentiment analysis. In order to know the opinion of people who speak Tamil in an effective manner an effective algorithm is needed. Since there are many algorithms available in machine learning and deep learning, this work aims to find sentiment in code mixed words. Deep learning based Bi-LSTM model with ULMFiT Embedding gives more promising results for code-mixed language than other existing algorithms.},

  year={2011},

  pages={73-75},
  abstract={Security vendors are facing a serious problem of defeating the complexity of malwares. With the popularity and the variety of malware over the Internet, generating their signatures for detecting via anti-virus (AV) scan engines becomes an important reactive security function. However, AV security products consume much of the PC memory and resources due to their large signature files. AV cloud computing becomes a popular solution for this problem. In this paper, a novel automatic malware signature discovery system for AV cloud (AMSDS) is proposed to generate malware signatures from both static and dynamic aspects. Our experiment on millions-scale samples indicates that AMSDS outperforms most automatic signature generation techniques of both industry and academia. The detection model of malware signature can provides research thinking for anti-virus technology to improve and enhance, especially on detecting and preventing unknown viruses or malware signature.},

  abstract={In recent times, cloud computing has become one of essential computing paradigms. Several companies and organizations that aim of using a cloud computing technology worry about the migration of their work to the cloud computing. This is due to the data security issues where cybercrimes are representing a real problem for them because of the huge damage that can cause. This lead researchers and scientists to thinking about provide new procedures and strategies to fight and trace criminals and attackers. Besides investigating crimes related to the cloud environment in forensically sound manner, the process of performing cybercrime investigation in the cloud environment is known as cloud forensics. This process is facing complex challenges due to the dynamic nature of cloud computing. In this paper, a cloud forensic strategy is proposed for assisting digital investigators and experts for investigation of cybercrimes in effective and efficient manner. The proposed strategy is based on cloud computing platform that providing enormous processing and storage capabilities. This strategy can be as guided to the digital investigators and practitioners to follow it in performing of investigation of cybercrimes.},

The formation mechanism of crowd risk consists of four stages namely free movement, retention, congestion and stampede, and by using the method of event tree, the important impact of crowd flow on crowd risk was found out. Combined with crowd risk model, the thinking of computer simulation on crowd risk was proposed to provide a reference for crowd security management in large gathering spots.},

We think the precision is more important than recall rate because WSD is core for other semantic information processing fields and relates to the results deeply. Therefore, we propose an adapted method to improve the precision based on relation structure (RS) algorithm. Through experiment comparing 3 kinds (SSI, RS, and a-RS) of WSD method, we show the performance of a-RS algorithm.},

  abstract={Complex systems may have to meet severe availability objectives related to the importance of the service being provided; such systems must be fault tolerant. Designers of fault-tolerant systems try to implement diagnostics to detect as many faults as possible because, in complex systems, uncovered faults lead to latent highly undesired situations. Unfortunately, diagnostics themselves may fail. Starting from the basics of FMECA, a design methodology and a tool have been developed. It is called DIANA (DIagnostic ANAlysis). The basic idea of DIANA is to perform coverage analysis during hardware and firmware design together with reliability engineering analysis. To this purpose, DIANA has been integrated into the computer aided design (CAD) tools in the same way that logic simulation timing analysis and analog transmission simulation are performed. Two main results have been obtained by the DIANA project: the first is to give the designers a tool that helps them to think in such a way as to prevent uncovered fault situations; the second is to calculate the effects of faults on diagnostics in order to provide transition rates to system availability models when real, rather than ideal, cases are taken into account.},

  abstract={We prove, that a CNN in which the parameters of all cells can be separately controlled, is the analog correspondent of a two-dimensional Ising type (Edwards-Anderson) spin-glass system. Using the properties of CNN we show that one single operation (template) always yields a local minimum of the spin-glass energy function. This way a very fast optimization method, similar to simulated annealing, can be built. Estimating the simulation time needed with our optimization algorithm on CNN based computers, and comparing it with the time needed on normal digital computers using the simulated annealing algorithm, the results are astonishing: CNN computers could be faster than digital computers already at 10times10 lattice sizes. The local control of the template parameters was already partially realized on some of the hardwares, we think this study could further motivate their development in this direction.},

The need for highly qualified specialists is very acute and is expressed in several occasions as a request addressed to universities to double the number of bachelor graduates. In this sense universities try to adapt and they provide distance learning programs. In this context all the advantages of software must be used: generative learning objects, gamifications etc. A gamification model for sorting algorithms is proposed in this sense in order to exercise the logic steps of programming and algorithms thus triggering a way of thinking that is needed in the creation of new software. To motivate the student in performing the exercise we used some elements of game mechanics like score and difficulty levels. All the newly created e-learning models are provided to the student through an online Web application.},

Ponemon Institute research report [1] has showed that data security has become of great concern to the users who aren't likely to entrust their data to an external company without a guarantee. In fact, cloud users are still unenthusiastic about storing their data in an external data centers and think that storage cloud systems are vulnerable. In this context, several proposals have been presented in the literature to provide secure cloud storage.},

The structure of our algorithm is similar to radix sort except that it typically requires less number of communication phases. We present experimental results for our algorithm on two distributed memory multiprocessors, the Intel Paragon and the Thinking machine CM-5. These results are compared with two other well known practical parallel sorting algorithms based on radix sort and sample sort. The experimental results show that the distributed radix-sort is competitive with the other two algorithms.},

  abstract={A simulation-based approach for assessing the reliability of structures has been developed over the last decade and is documented in a textbook. The approach includes computer programs M-Star/sup TM/ ResCom/sup TM/, AntHill/sup TM/ and DamAc/sup TM/ for analysis of single- as well as multi-component simultaneous load effects; and for assessing carrying capacity and serviceability. These programs have been used in several graduate and undergraduate courses in civil engineering to explore a variety of problems from variable load combinations, to design of a frame with a leaning column. Students have found the software easy to understand and use. The ability to easily vary parameters and the existence of graphical output has allowed them to gain insight into the effect of variability on design. The application of the simulation-based approach is not limited to structural reliability problems. The simulation technique can assist in the transition from a deterministic "way of thinking" to a probabilistic evaluation of many problems in everyday life.},

The laboratory notebook illustrates the thought-to-paper conversion process inherent within the presimulation learning experience. Notebook scribblings, characterized by the student as a thinking schematic, are decoded by the instructor for the purpose of developing teaching materials, including new problems that cannot be immediately submitted to a simulator.

In the research field of game AI, it is a good approach to allow the non-player-characters (NPCs) of digital games to become more humanity. In this paper, we try to build a tank-battle computer game and use the methodology of reinforcement learning for the NPCs (tanks). The goal of this paper is to make this game become more interesting from the enhanced interactions with these intelligent NPCs.},

  abstract={Tangram, a well-known traditional puzzle, is a tool in elementary education which is often associated with creative thinking. It consists of 7 boards (five triangles, one square and one parallelogram). Using tangram, we could build over 1600 kinds of shapes, such as houses, towers, and animals. However, it is very difficult to supplement a complete graphic with 7 boards. Therefore, this program was developed. In this program, the author used the DFS search algorithm and enumeration method to find all the solutions in the 13 convex figures in the Tangram. Then the author improved this search method to make the search algorithm run faster. The program is built using the Qt application development framework and C++ computer language and uses a user interface to display all the different results about the 13 convex graphics. The result of the research is that every convex polygon made of seven boards is not unique. Some graphics have only 16 transformations, but some will produce 224 different combinations of positions and colors.},
