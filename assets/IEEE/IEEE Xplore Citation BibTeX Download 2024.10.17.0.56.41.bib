  abstract={This paper arises from work ongoing in the GALA (Games and Learning Alliance - Network of Excellence for Serious Games). As part of GALA, a comprehensive state of the art analysis of existing serious games for the business and industry domain (loosely defined) was undertaken. A categorisation of the identified serious games was developed in order to analyse the characteristics of the serious games - the aspects they covered and those they do not cover. Of primary importance were the simulation level, topic and skills mediated by the identified serious games. The "simulation level" means the level or amount of the world that is simulated in the simulation or serious game. This is a hierarchy starting with the World/ God/ Universe - in which level whole worlds are simulated, for example, in games such as Civilization. The hierarchy then proceeds downwards from nation, industry, inter-organisational, business/ organisation, intra-organisational/ processes, group/ team, discipline, techniques to games addressing the individual. Second the skills to be transferred by the serious game were also analysed. From this an analysis of the gaps in coverage of serious games was carried out, leading to identifying opportunities for, and recommendations of, serious games to be developed for the business and industry domain.},

  title={The effect of student learning styles on the learning gains achieved when interactive simulations are coupled with real-time formative assessment via pen-enabled mobile technology}, 
  year={2012},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This paper describes results from a project in an undergraduate engineering physics course that coupled classroom use of interactive computer simulations with the collection of real-time formative assessment using pen-enabled mobile technology. Interactive simulations (free or textbook-based) are widely used across the undergraduate engineering curriculum to help actively engaged students increase their understanding of abstract concepts or phenomena which are not directly or easily observable. However, there are indications in the literature that we do not yet know the pedagogical best practices associated with their use to maximize learning. This project couples student use of interactive simulations with the gathering of real-time formative assessment via pen-enabled mobile technology (in this case, Tablet PCs). The research question addressed in this paper is: are learning gains achieved with this coupled model greater for certain types of learners in the undergraduate engineering classroom? To answer this, we correlate learning gains with various learning styles, as identified using the Index of Learning Styles (ILS) developed by Felder and Soloman. These insights will be useful for others who use interactive computer simulations in their instruction and other adopters of this pedagogical model; the insights may have broader implications about modification of instruction to address various learning styles.},

Video-based lectures and materials are to be referred before the actual class as a pre-class activity in the flipped classroom setting and completion status are evaluated through learner's feedback. In this paper, pre-class activities are evaluated by applying process mining on the student's clickstream data generated through learning platform “Delta” designed for current work. The students are categorized as credible and mediocre performers based on their pre-assessment score and process models are generated by applying fuzzy miner and heuristic miner based on their engagement with the tool. We further analyzed and registered the absolute & relative occurrences of events, identified a contrasting pattern in student behavior through trend analysis and process comparator. The various process models from learner's data were presented using several visualizations.},

  abstract={Engineering for the development, application, and recycling of products is recently supported by fully integrated model of product. Prototyping is moving to virtual by the application of sophisticated product models for complex simulations. Simulations rely upon knowledge representing experience, expertise and intelligence of engineers in knowledge wares. Increasing proportion of this knowledge is placed in the product model in the form of active rules, checks, and reactions. In case of any change of these knowledge representations, relevant product model entities are modified accordingly. This knowledge must be verified by practice. Consequently, interaction of virtual and physical worlds is anticipated as a main area for future research in product model based virtual engineering systems. The authors developed and published a novel knowledge based method for the definition of product objects during the recent years. In this paper, they conceptualize a possible integration of intelligent sensor networks with active knowledge in product models. They propose introduction of physical information space in order to receive engineering object related information from preprocessed sensor data. The proposed novel method is based on intelligent capabilities both in sensor and product modeling.},

  pages={117-122},
  abstract={Two main recent achievements of the first decade in this new century in model space based during product definition are representation of corporate knowledge in product model and extended application of contextual feature principle. Contextual connections are applied to define corporate knowledge features as relationships amongst product object parameters. Current product models include comprehensive range of contextual features. However, current user interfaces for product definition processes are not in the possession of capabilities for the required human-computer communication and model representation. Coordination of human originated intent and engineering objective definitions for product feature definitions is not available. The authors of this paper introduced a new contextual chain in which human intent, product behavior, and adaptive action objects are connected in order to establish modeling capabilities for the above communication, representation, and coordination. As a realization of this method, new sets of entities were defined to extend currently applied product model entity sets. This paper starts with characterizing and evaluation of the currently prevailing product modeling. Following this, a new model and its entities are introduced and the method of extension of current model with this model is explained. Implementation of the proposed method is facilitated by the possibility for new object class definition by using of open surface of current industrial product modeling systems.},

  pages={000197-000202},
  abstract={In knowledge-based societies new generations are flooded more and more intensely with narratives of inherited and newly generated knowledge, which is simply accessible for these generations, or to be acquired by them. Informatics and computer sciences are continuously developing new information-storage devices and a multitude of software more rapidly than ever. However, effective information search and processing require an information literacy which the new generations characteristically, and more and more demonstrably, do not have. National and international empirical research proves that the algorithmic thinking of the younger generations, which is indispensable for the world of informatics, is underdeveloped when it comes to the effective and productive use of digital tools. Moreover, the phenomenon of hyper attention invades the everyday life and the learning habits of the younger generation to a greater and greater degree. The essence of the HY-DE model is to aid the students' learning process with the help of the teacher's purposeful control of the phases of attention (hyper, mixed and deep attention). One aim of the present study is to introduce a new application of the HY-DE model, entitled Data-Structure Validator HY-DE model (DaSVa HY-DE). In the introductory phase, the DaSVa model focuses on how the HY-DE attention-divisions manifest themselves in webpage-search as well as in the information retrieval that it yields, and what the roles of the hyper, mixed, and deep attention modes are in the development of computational thinking and algorithmic skills. In the full hyper attention status the search for specified contents is carried out, focusing on webpages which consist of data organized in table or table-like structures. The automated and semi-automated conversion of the webpages however requires the decreasing of hyper attention leading to deep or mixed attention. The final result of this conversion process is/are well-structured table(s) suitable for automated data retrieval in spreadsheets, database management, and programming. The application of the original HY-DE model would lead us to its modification. In the advanced phase of the DaSVa HY-DE model the students can also experience how the webpages are designed and structured, how they support information and data retrieval, how successful the algorithmic based retrieval can be, and how the approach would lead students to the application of the theory of well-structured webpage design. With this model, from the hyper attention data collection status, through a deep and/or mixed attention algorithm building and data analyzing process, students would reach a higher-level hyper attention, the developer status.},

This research attempts to answer the question and tries to determine what factors can affect an employee to become a chief and capable to achieve performance target. To address the question, this study adopts predictive modelling approach using classification techniques and kl-divergence function. The research proposes some recommendations based on applied algorithm. Additionally, the study shows it is easier to choose a chief based on their historical data compare to predicting which employee can perform well in the future or predicting both potential chief and high performer employees. If organization wants to select potential employees to become chief and predicts them achieving their target, classification techniques should include all employees as the population and avoid to choose only subsets to ensure the confidence of result. Meanwhile, KL-Divergence function generates competencies that affect employee who become a chief and achieve the target. They are achievement orientation, adaptability, analytical thinking, communication and information seeking.},

In addition, the author used the Union-Find to find the legal landing point on the chessboard. Finally, the experiment shows that this type of No-Go algorithm based on reinforcement learning can be improved by itself and reach a certain level of chess ability, which improves the efficiency of searching legal moves compared with the traditional No-Go chessboard traversal method.},

  abstract={The cloud model is good at bridging the gap between qualitatives and quantities, and so it was applied to evaluating mildew degree of rice seeds based on machine vision. A symmetric cloud and two asymmetric clouds were designed to express three qualitative concepts and the relationship between them. These three qualitative concepts represent different mildew degree including non-mildew, spot mildew and severe mildew. The mathematical property of each qualitative concept was described by a group of digital characteristics. After color features which can reflect the changes of diseased rice seeds were extracted from images, a cloud classifier was developed to classify the mildewed seeds elastically on the basis of cloud generators which implemented mapping between qualitativeness and quantities. Compared with the current rigid classifying methods, the cloud classifier was in conformity with the real distribution of data and simulated human thinking in qualitative way. An experiment was conducted to test on the classifier based on cloud and another classifier based on neural network. The results showed that the classification accuracy of cloud classifier was higher than the classification accuracy of neural network.},

  abstract={Generative AI faces many challenges when entering the product design workflow, such as interface usability and interaction patterns. Therefore, based on design thinking and design process, we developed the DesignGPT multi-agent collaboration framework, which uses artificial intelligence agents to simulate the roles of different positions in the design company and allows human designers to collaborate with them in natural language. Experimental results show that compared with separate AI tools, DesignGPT improves the performance of designers, highlighting the potential of applying multi-agent systems that integrate design domain knowledge to product scheme design.},
