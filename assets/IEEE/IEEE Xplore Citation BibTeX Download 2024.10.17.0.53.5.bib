  abstract={Whereas the imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) shows limited global search ability and be liable to be trapped into local optimum, a double-assimilation of prosperity and destruction oriented improved imperialist competitive algorithm (DPDO-IIC A) is proposed tentatively to overcome inherent defects. The imperialist assimilation and colonial reform strategy are customized purposefully, and a novel population redistribution mechanism is introduced as well. The three improvement measures are supposed to further promote population diversity and searching accuracy. The CEC2017 test set is selected to verify the performance of the DPDO-IICA by the different types of numerical function problems with the different dimensions. Moreover, the DPDO-IICA is compared with the three first-class intelligent optimization algorithms, which have achieved significant rankings in the CEC2017 competition. The comparison shows that the DPDO-IICA has good performances, which is demonstrated by the accuracy and stability. In addition, the proportion of imperialists and colonies is investigated, and it is through the community partitioning and clustering dynamically to enhance the population diversity. In conclusion, the DPDO-IICA can effectively improve the ability of global exploration and avoid premature convergence in comparison with the original ICA.},

  abstract={Existing scheduling and decision solutions to container terminal logistics systems (CTLS) are falling short of peoples' wishes both in theory and in practice. This paper proposes a container terminal gang scheduling computational paradigm (GSCP) for planning and control at container terminals based on computational thinking. GSCP is built on the computing perspective and architecture of multi-processor system-on-chip. GSCP applies principles of pervasive computing to evaluate load conditions of core resources, and then integrates the fundamental principles of gang scheduling, processor affinity and load balancing to define the flexible and robust decision framework and scheduling algorithm set. Those are intended to improve the performance of CTLS, and strive for balance among through capacity for vessels and containers, task latency and load leveling as well. GSCP is demonstrated and validated by a typical container hub logistics service case with intensive computational experiments.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) has become an indispensable skill in the 21st century and has permeated into K-12 education at all levels. The evaluation of CT has become a crucial concern for educators and researchers. Currently., while extensive research has investigated the assessment of students' CT conceptual understanding., the measurement of their thinking processes is less involved. The game-based assessment appears to address this issue by analyzing students' behaviors and reactions during the gameplay process., which has become an emerging assessment tool in CT education. This drives the need for a comprehensive overview of this field. To fill this gap., this study aims to conduct a systematic literature review on the assessment of CT through games. It explores CT skills assessed through games., focusing on target groups, game forms., and benefits. A total of fifteen studies were examined. Findings indicate that algorithmic thinking, problem decomposition, pattern recognition., and abstraction were commonly assessed in games. Different ways for assessing CT skills in games were identified, involving progression level, log data, and manual coding. The benefits of CT game-based assessments were broadly reported, such as enjoyable experiences for students, instant feedback, easy administration for teachers and researchers, and richer information on students' cognitive processes. However, limited has been done in exploring the use of digital games for younger age groups, and the psychometric qualities of the tools were hardly reported in the reviewed studies. The study sheds light on the research and teaching practices in using games and interactive assessment platforms in CT education.},

  abstract={The popularization of digital educational devices with low barriers to entry has encouraged the development of many training activities oriented towards the incorporation of technology in schools. In some cases, the introduction of technology has led to the development of new educational practices that support the development of computational thinking. However, the supposed benefits of these approaches have not been properly assessed. Moreover, having taught over 30 workshops with the Scratch programming tool to teachers at different educational levels (primary, secondary, university), we found no evidence of subsequent methodological changes in schools. This study tries to understand the dissonance between the alleged success of initiatives around digital literacy and the lack of continuity in the use of user-friendly programming environments like Scratch. For this purpose, we analyzed the evolution of the grades of Scratch programming achieved by the students of the School of Education of Vitoria-Gasteiz and their engagement with Scratch. We also interviewed teachers from different schools who have participated in Scratch workshops with us. After this study, we identified some of the circumstances that facilitate and hinder the development of computational thinking. Since we consider Scratch as a resource that allows the development of new methodological approaches in the classroom as well as the acquisition of skills related to computational thinking, we propose a framework that will help to overcome the current status.},

  abstract={This paper provides insights from a preliminary study on how embedding critical academic literacy skills using active learning strategies in a small Master's level computer science course might impact student performance, skills development, and engagement. One goal of higher education is to develop students' critical thinking and research skills. Prior work suggests these skills are best taught explicitly, when they are embedded in the curriculum, using active learning strategies, and using recent high-quality research as a basis for inquiry. Using multiple methods, this paper examines how teaching critical academic literacy skills through active learning strategies impacts student critical thinking ability and engagement. Results suggest substantial student engagement and improvements in critical literacy skills.},

Fuzzy qualifications and quantifications for both absolute and relative measures are formally elaborated on discrete and continuous fuzzy object and expressions. In addition, the qualification for characteristic attributes of fuzzy objects is modeled. Applications of fuzzy qualifications and quantifications are illustrated using a rich set of examples and real-world cases, which enable machines to mimic complex human reasoning mechanisms in cognitive informatics, soft computing, and computational intelligence.},

  pages={357-362},
  abstract={Occasionally, there may be a low impact on learning engagement between teachers and students due to, for example, poor internet connection or simply because students have lost their focus. One of the methods to improve learning engagement is through a research framework called Unified Theory Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). This paper adopted 17 UTAUT questions to compare with research variables (pre-post surveys and genders). The user acceptance and use of technology or UTAUT consisted of Likert scale (Strongly disagree to Strongly Agree) questions, computed to generate total scores for each participant. Then, the scores will be compared to each variable to investigate the relationships between these variables against the UTAUT. This study could be implemented via online learning, but in the end, the offline (unplugged) method was the only method to deliver the learning activities. There is limited evidence discussing UTAUT within the area of offline learning; hence, this paper will focus on another spectrum regarding the UTAUT study. Instead of mobile (online) learning engagement, this paper studies the relationship between unplugged learning with user acceptance and the use of technology. Spearman correlation indicated that the unplugged learning approach has a significant positive relationship with user acceptance and use of technology. It revealed that students may also demonstrate an interest in online learning engagement and be able to comprehensively accept the online learning approach. In contrast, Mann-Whitney U test analysis on genders revealed no significant difference. The findings could contribute to another noteworthy discussion regarding the validity of user acceptance and the use of technology against the unplugged learning approach.},

Eighty-six engineering undergraduates participated in this experimental study for exploring the effectiveness of the IMSP program. The findings indicate that 1) the IMSP program promoted undergraduates' computational thinking, and further enhanced their design innovation ability; 2) the program that integrated the conceptualization of sustainability has better teaching effects than that without the conceptual integration; 3) the personal characters of innovation proaction and emotional intelligence acted as moderators in the ISMP program. This study presents a practical method for improving design innovation capability, and supports the feasibility and necessity of emphasizing computational thinking and sustainability in the innovation training program for engineering education.},

  abstract={The revival of artificial intelligence (AI) a few years ago has often been attributed to the success of machine learning (ML), especially the branch of ML known as deep learning (DL). Since the introduction of workable DL, numerous success stories have been widely reported: board games, autonomous driving vehicles, natural language translation, voice recognition, etc. However, for machines to exhibit a high degree of intelligence, they need more than the ability to learn. Indeed, heavy reliance on ML has resulted in widely publicized mishaps that negatively affect people in unexpected ways. For healthcare and other mission-critical applications, intelligent machines need to perform dependably to earn and maintain the trust of human users. To this end, it is necessary to take a holistic view toward AI, one that encompasses multiple facets of what constitutes intelligence. Specifically, this paper previews what thinking machines would be capable of by taking into consideration a machine's ability to abstract and reason, in addition to its ability to learn.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-4},
  abstract={This work-in-progress paper is part of a project that aims to analyze how the implementation of different instructional designs through complete and incomplete examples influence the cognitive load that students perceive when learning statistics and computer programming. For this first stage, we conducted a pilot study aimed at conducting a differentiated measurement of cognitive loads through secondary tasks and a subjective scale. The pilot study consisted of three moments. The first one focused on measuring their working memory capacity and their prior knowledge of statistics. Then, students worked on a learning activity focused on using Chi-square and Pearson correlation to conduct inferential analyses. The study included two different instructional designs in the form of computational notebooks. Design 1 consisted of correct and incomplete examples, while Design 2 included correct, incomplete, and incorrect examples. Simultaneously, students had to attend to a secondary task, which consisted of responding to an auditory stimulus, after which they had to press a key on their keyboard. Finally, students completed a naïve rating scale of cognitive loads involved in the task. The results highlight the important role of prior knowledge in different instructional designs and how it connects to students' perceived cognitive effort. Likewise, the differences in the instructional designs influenced students' cognitive loads, suggesting a differentiated measure of extraneous loads. Using incorrect examples in learning statistics and programming may affect students' perceived difficulty without resulting in a better learning outcome.},

  year={2018},
  volume={},

  pages={478-479},
  abstract={Both human brain and computer (electronic brain) could process data and do some cognition and computation tasks. Is the cognition of human brain equal to the computation of computer? It is obviously not. In this talk, the relationships of brain cognition models and intelligence computation models are summarized into four different types, that is, human brain cognition inspired intelligence computation (BCIIC), intelligence computation without human brain cognition (ICOBC), intelligence computation assisted human brain cognition (ICABC), and the integration of human brain cognition and intelligence computation (BC&IC). There are three paradigms in traditional artificial intelligence (AI) studies, that is, symbolism AI, connectionism AI, and behaviorism AI. The physical symbol system hypothesis is used in the symbolism AI. Human brain cognition is taken as a kind of symbolic processing, and the processes of human thinking are computed by symbol in the symbolism AI [1,2]. The connectionism AI relies on the bionics to simulate human brain. In the connectionism AI, neuron is taken as the basic unite of human thinking, and the intelligence is taken as the result of interconnected neurons competition and collaboration [3,4]. In the behaviorism AI, intelligence depends on the perception and behavior, “Perception-action” model is used, and intelligence may not require knowledge, knowledge representation and knowledge reasoning [5]. The symbolism AI and connectionism AI are two different types of human brain cognition inspired intelligence computation, while the behaviorism AI is a representative case of intelligence computation without human brain cognition. Usually, AI researchers get some inspiration from human brain cognition in their studies. On the other way, intelligence computation could also assist human brain cognition studies. The bidirectional cognitive computing model (BCC) is such a case. It studies the bidirectional transformations between the intension and extension of a concept. It is used to simulate some human brain cognition tasks such as learning and recognition [6,7]. Cognitive computing is one of the core fields of artificial intelligence [8,9]. Data-driven granular cognitive computing (DGCC) is an example of the integration of human brain cognition and intelligence computation [10,11]. It takes data as a special kind of knowledge expressed in the lowest granularity level of a multiple granularity space. It integrates two contradictory mechanisms, namely, the human's cognition mechanism of ``global precedence'' which is a cognition process of ``from coarser to finer'' and the information processing mechanism of machine learning systems which is ``from finer to coarser'', in a multiple granularity space. It is data-driven cognitive computing model. The integration of human brain cognition and intelligence computation would be an important research topic of artificial intelligence. Some scientific research issues of the integration of human brain cognition and intelligence computation are discussed based on DGCC.},

  abstract={Design is considered by most to be the central activity of engineering. Also, it is known that engineering programs should graduate engineers who can design effectively to meet social and environmental needs. Though the role and perception of design across a wide range of educational institutions have improved markedly in recent years; however, both, design faculty & design practitioners argue that further improvements are necessary. One of the defining characteristics of design is that there is rarely a single correct answer to an engineering problem but, rather, an optimal or acceptable solution leading to a final design, presented as the best possible balance between technical as well as non-technical constraints. These nontechnical constraints typically involve economics, politics, social and environmental issues, ethics, etc. And, while professional practitioners generally accept this understanding of design, students, by enlarge, tend to interpret the engineering design process as an unambiguous and clearly defined process supported by rigidly applied principles and processes of “the scientific method.” Students' vision and mis-concepts of design do require proper alignment with prevailing conditions on the ground. Undoubtedly, the start of any design course should be preceded by exposure to design thinking and related processes. The paper reviews the role of design in engineering programs, and outlines the current research on how design thinking processes could be taught and learned. It explores also the currently most-favored pedagogical model for teaching design, namely: Project-Based Learning (PBL). The paper identifies several contexts for PBL, along with some available data on it success. Finally, the paper raises some of the questions that should be answered to identify the most effective pedagogical practices of improving design learning.},

  abstract={We present a critique of the current teaching practices of simulation. We challenge the current view of simulation, to the extent that most textbooks' contents will be found to be secondary to the missing necessary primary material. We advocate that (simulation) education has four general objectives, which are to teach students how to learn, how to think creatively, how to problem solve, and how to be professionals. These four objectives of education may not be possible to teach. In the words of Oscar Wilde, "Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught". So an education in simulation requires that students be put into learning situations that enable them to learn the requisite knowledge concerning the four objectives.},

  abstract={In the frames of the process of informatisation of education, the issue of the formation of optimization thinking among high school students has been considered. The formation of this kind of competences cannot be ensured by purely theoretical training; therefore, it is proposed to use models of optimal environmental management as vivid examples of solving optimization problems. The models illustrate such basic optimization concepts as the objective functional, different kinds of constraints, and the formulation of nonlinear and dynamic programming problems. Using the examples of managing the process of forest restoration, the importance of the correct selection of parameters of the model and methods for solving the optimization problem is shown. Concrete examples of using the proposed technique are given.},

  abstract={Educational game design environments are used for teaching computational thinking and software engineering concepts to novices. In software engineering education, there has recently been calls for "innovative methods for software teaching and training in online courses" (http://2014.icse-conferences.org/seet). However, to date, learning these concepts is tied to a formal learning environment and the presence of a teacher. In line with the new educational opportunities provided by the Web such as massive open online courses (MOOCs) and e-learning 2.0 platforms, we have created an online educational game design environment with integrated learning resources including video tutorials, showcases, and communication tools. To understand the effect of online educational game design environments with integrated support for learning on novices' use of the system and their learning, we conducted a mixed-method study with nine participants. While the learning goals were achieved to a high degree, the analysis of participants' interaction with the system reveals interesting phenomena about user preferences, such as the fact that during the given computational thinking tasks, the participants preferred the synchronous communication channel to other forms of commonly provided learning resources such as forums.},

  pages={33-39},
  abstract={Natural language's creative genres are traditionally considered to be outside the scope of computational modeling. Computational linguists have paid little attention to humor in particular because it is puzzling by nature. However, given the importance of humor in our daily lives and computers in our work and entertainment, studies related to computational humor will become increasingly significant in fields such as human-computer interaction, intelligent interactive entertainment, and computer-assisted education. In this article, we explore computational approaches' applicability to the recognition and use of verbally expressed humor. Particularly, we focus on three important research questions related to this problem: Can we automatically gather large collections of humorous texts? Can we automatically recognize humor in text? And can we automatically insert humorous add-ons into existing applications?},

  abstract={Computational Thinking (CT) allows us to solve complex problems by expressing it in a way that computers, humans, or both, can understand. CT is closely related to problem solving and critical thinking, which are actively used in STEM education. Research on CT has gained steady momentum recently, and many of the institutions around the world have adopted CT into their curriculum. This paper presents a literature review conducted to identify the interventions used to develop CT skills and the methods used to assess CT skills. The review explored various publications on CT and identified that curriculum-based interventions and workshops are the primary interventions used for introducing CT in the educational sector. During the analysis, we have also identified a handful of assessment tools used for measuring CT skills, but they are not standardized assessment tools. Hence, we plan to analyze the existing assessment methods and propose a new sophisticated tool for evaluating CT skills as our future work.},

Computational thinking is central to recent approaches aimed at engaging K-12 students in computer science. Many strategies and metrics have been proposed to foster and measure such skills. The poster presents an empirical study which measures the understanding, recognition and rule construction ability of rising 3rd to 5th grade students from underrepresented communities. This poster also focuses on strategies for engaging students and reflects the importance of a coherent computer science curriculum which includes collaboration and individual activities supported by a graphical tool like Microsoft's Kodu Game Lab.},
