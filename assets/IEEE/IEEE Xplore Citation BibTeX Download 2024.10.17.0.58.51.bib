  year={2022},
  volume={1},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This paper synthesizes three fundamental challenges within existing frameworks for the ethical regulation of artificial intelligence (AI) identified in recently published literature. These challenges have recently been raised by ethicists, computer scientists, and policymakers. More specifically, existing frameworks are encountering challenges such as the difficulties that come along with defining an AI, adapting to the needs of the public in participating in democratic governance, and considering the environmental impacts of these systems. After critically reviewing the three challenges, this paper proposes alternative regulatory approaches to address each of these regulatory challenges. To address the definition challenge, we propose a multidimensional approach to defining AI. We argue that a relational approach can be helpful for making visible the cultural context in which AI systems are embedded. Finally, we suggest that involving a systematic environmental studies approach in assessing AI is conducive to the development of not only more environmentally friendly AI systems but also AI technologies that can be used to address challenging global environmental issues.},

With the advent of the era of film virtual production, film digital assets will become the main role of film art creation. In the face of efficient virtual production rhythm, the use of artificial intelligence and human-machine cooperation technology will greatly improve the efficiency of film art creation. It can not only give greater play to the artists' creative inspiration and ideas, but also make full use of the massive storage capacity and amazing computing speed of the computer. The human-machine cooperation film art creation method will also become one of the main methods of film art creation in the future. This paper proposes a framework of film art creation using human-machine cooperation technology, which will be the future efficient method in film art creation field.},

  abstract={High Performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark is a standard tool to measure the performance of High Performance Computing Clusters (HPCC). There are several parameters which can be optimized to maximize performance delivered by HPCC. HPL provides many such parameters for evaluation of performance. P & Q are two such values which determine the distribution pattern of processes for executing HPL. In this paper HPL runs with different values of P and Q have been carried out for three different values of N while keeping the block size (NB) constant. Value of N represents the problem size of task being executed. Results obtained are included in tables and are also depicted in form of graph and are analytically discussed. These results also provide the basis for deeper analytical approaches for HPCC performance evaluations. This critical analysis also reveals that maximum performance is delivered if the task is evenly distributed over all the available cores and nodes in the HPCC.},

  abstract={With the increasing demand of power supply reliability from power users as well as the great impact of natural disasters on power supply reliability, it is of great significance in recent years to improve the efficiency of the emergency repair of the distribution network failure after the disaster and restore the power supply as soon as possible. However, the current analysis of the impact of the external environment on emergency repairs is not in-depth, resulting in its model not being able to fully reflect the actual circumstances of the distribution network emergency repairs under the background of disasters, making the actual feasibility of the strategies developed poorly. In view of the above-mentioned shortcomings, this paper analyzes the characteristics of multi-fault emergency repairs under disaster conditions compared with those under normal conditions, proposes a dynamic impact model including weather, repair sites, and infrastructure, also establishes a multi-fault emergency repair model of distribution network and optimization model of emergency repair strategy for distribution network. The simulated annealing algorithm (Simulated Annealing Algorithm, SAA) is used to solve the problem, and through horizontal comparison with common swarm intelligence algorithms such as genetic algorithm, it proves the advantages of SAA algorithm in calculation speed and ability to find the optimal solution. According to the actual data, the methods and principles of formulating the best emergency repair strategy for the distribution network under the disaster background are analyzed.},

  abstract={User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design have a very important role in the development of digital products and services. UX quality is determined by the extent to which the UI developed can meet the needs of users. There are several factors that influence the quality of UX, one of which is its usability. Usability is one of the important concepts in UI/UX design, which aims to create products that are easy to use, effective, and satisfying for users. Lova.ID, a company that sells women's fashion, requires an E-Commerce website system to increase marketing and sales. To find out whether the UI/UX prototype can be used according to user needs, it is necessary to carry out a usability testing and analysis. This study aims to test the UI/UX prototype that has been made. Tests based on effectiveness, efficiency, and user usability use the time based efficiency method and the System Usability Scale (SUS). The results of this study note that users can complete all tasks properly to determine the effectiveness of the prototype with a percentage of 100%. In addition, the average time needed to do all tasks is included in the fast classification. And, the usability of the prototype is at level B, which means it is well accepted by users.},

  abstract={Abstract rules can be learned by several species (not only humans). We propose a biologically plausible model for same/different discrimination, that can point towards the neural basis of abstract concept learning. By including a neural adaptation mechanism to a discriminator model formerly introduced in the literature, selective clusters of neurons fire depending on whether or not the stimuli compared are the same or not. These selective neurons are consistent with experimental findings in the literature. Moreover, reward and attention can modulate the relative strength of each attribute/feature of the stimulus, so more complex abstract discriminations can be achieved using the proposed model as a building block. As a formal model, it can be easily incorporated into several applications in robotics and intelligent machines.},

Intelligent tools such as genetic algorithm (GA) and case-based reasoning (CBR), were used to find a feasible and optimal solution quickly in a large design space. The way to combine the designer's intelligence during the whole automatic optimization searching process was described. The optimization design system not only integrates the intelligence of design examples, experts, designers and computer, but also supports the designers to utilize all the knowledge resources to design.

  abstract={This work aims to explore the innovative fusion of image style transfer technology and pattern derivative design, and seek new avenues for the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology with China's intangible cultural heritage. The batch processing and high efficiency characteristics of AI technology are adopted and derivative design is taken as a medium to effectively disseminate black copper patterns infused with silver. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models from deep learning are employed and tuned with appropriate parameters. The deep learning framework realizes the generation of black copper patterns infused with silver. Furthermore, by incorporating image style transfer algorithms, novel pattern aesthetics are designed while preserving the distinctive features of black copper patterns infused with silver. Expert assessments through questionnaire responses reveal that the average rating for the visual aesthetics of the images is 4 points, with a high score of 4.08 for style simulation effectiveness, and a presentation rating of 3.67 for Yunnan's cultural connotation. Expert reviews show approval for the migration results in the experiment, as the transferred pattern designs satisfy aesthetic preferences and meet the standards for simulating different styles. This work provides valuable insights for the preservation and inheritance of black copper patterns infused with silver, as well as for promoting their diversified applications.},
