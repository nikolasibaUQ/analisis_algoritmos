  abstract={Most countries in the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) have adopted national development plans that recognize ICT as the main driver for economic development. For ICT to effectively contribute to the national development agenda however, there is a need to ensure that citizens are ICT literate. As a result, a number of countries have developed Subject Policy Guidelines aimed at introducing Computer Studies at Secondary School level. While most of these guidelines are carefully crafted, actual implementation in secondary schools has proved troublesome; having under-maintained or non-existent ICT infrastructures along with inadequately trained teachers as major obstacles. Subsequently, most African student's first exposure to computer programming occurs in the first year of university education, thus entering the Computer Science major without any prior hands-on experience. The Namibian Technology Outreach to Secondary Schools (NAMTOSS) initiative is a pilot program started by the School of Computing (SoC) at the University of Namibia (UNAM) in March 2016. NAMTOSS is a partnership between secondary school teachers, learners and the staff members of the School of Computing at UNAM that is designed to introduce computer programming skills and computational thinking at secondary school level. NAMTOSS attempts to address the structural and systemic issues raised by previously unsuccessful outreach efforts conducted in Southern Africa. In this paper, we enumerate the successes and failures of our initial outreach efforts and suggest several enhancements to our program that we feel will lead to its success.},

  abstract={The last decade has seen a surge in expanding access to Computer Science (CS) education, especially for K-12, with many states even stipulating student learning standards in CS and Computational Thinking (CT). Our 21st century K-12 students are no longer just computer users, but are now required to be computationally literate creators with proficient skills both in the concepts and practices of CS and CT. At the same time, technology continues to pervade our lives and expand at a relentless pace and all aspects of our lives are now embedded in technology surrounded by Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI in the form of Machine Learning (ML) is a key technology in a diversity of applications, where we use sensors to meaningfully perceive the world around us, analyze and organize the perceived data, and autonomously use that data to make predictions and decisions. In higher education, AI/ML courses proliferate, with many institutions now conferring degrees and certifications in these. To an extent, some high schools (grades 9–12) have started introducing these concepts in a technology class, or a robotics club, or as an after-school activity. As for middle (grades 6–8) and elementary school (grades K-5), there are very few examples of such instruction. In this paper, we present a complete framework for elementary and middle school teachers to help them prepare and incorporate AI/ML lessons in their classrooms using hands-on active learning strategies. We want to empower these teachers to impart improved learning to their students, which in turn will prepare their students to become effective thinkers, problem solvers, communicators, and gain necessary skills for high-skilled and high-demand jobs. We describe a detailed AI/ML lesson plan based on standards and framework, AI4K12 big ideas, art and science of curriculum design, active learning, and culturally responsive and inclusive pedagogy. Then we discuss our experiences in teaching the same to $\boldsymbol{4}^{\mathbf{th}}$ grade students in an elementary school.},

  title={Sparse Feature Representation Learning for Deep Face Gender Transfer}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={4070-4080},
  abstract={Why do people think Tom Hanks and Juliette Lewis look alike? Can we modify the gender appearance of a face image without changing its identity information? Is there any specific feature responsible for the perception of femininity/masculinity in a given face image? Those questions are appealing from both computer vision and visual perception perspectives. To shed light upon them, we propose to develop a GAN based approach toward face gender transfer and study the relevance of learned feature representations to face gender perception. Our key contributions include: 1) an architecture design with specially tailored loss functions in the feature space for face gender transfer; 2) the introduction of a novel probabilistic gender mask to facilitate achieving both the objectives of gender transfer and identity preservation; and 3) identification of sparse features (≈ 20 out of 256) uniquely responsible for face gender perception. Extensive experimental results are reported to demonstrate not only the superiority of the proposed face gender transfer technique (in terms of visual quality of reconstructed images) but also the effectiveness of gender feature representation learning (in terms of the high correlation between the learned sparse features and the perceived gender information). Our findings seem to corroborate a hypothesis about the independence between face recognizability and gender classifiability in the literature of psychology. We expect this work will stimulate more computational studies of different face perception attributes including race, age, attractiveness, and trustworthiness.},

  volume={1},
  number={1_2},
  pages={179-209},
  abstract={Our concepts of biology, evolution, and complexity are constrained by having observed only a single instance of life, life on earth. A truly comparative biology is needed to extend these concepts. Because we cannot observe life on other planets, we are left with the alternative of creating Artificial Life forms on earth. I will discuss the approach of inoculating evolution by natural selection into the medium of the digital computer. This is not a physical/chemical medium; it is a logical/informational medium. Thus, these new instances of evolution are not subject to the same physical laws as organic evolution (e.g., the laws of thermodynamics) and exist in what amounts to another universe, governed by the “physical laws” of the logic of the computer. This exercise gives us a broader perspective on what evolution is and what it does. An evolutionary approach to synthetic biology consists of inoculating the process of evolution by natural selection into an artificial medium. Evolution is then allowed to find the natural forms of living organisms in the artificial medium. These are not models of life, but independent instances of life. This essay is intended to communicate a way of thinking about synthetic biology that leads to a particular approach: to understand and respect the natural form of the artificial medium, to facilitate the process of evolution in generating forms that are adapted to the medium, and to let evolution find forms and processes that naturally exploit the possibilities inherent in the medium. Examples are cited of synthetic biology embedded in the computational medium, where in addition to being an exercise in experimental comparative evolutionary biology, it is also a possible means of harnessing the evolutionary process for the production of complex computer software.},

  abstract={Blockchain technology is a decentralized distributed system meant for secure computation and information sharing platform free from any central authority that enables multiple authoritative domain which do not trust each other, to cooperate, coordinate and collaborate in rational decision-making process. Bitcoin is pioneer crypto currency platform that uses blockchain technology but over the time it has moved beyond Bitcoin and has successfully bypassed to other application domain. Beside Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger and Corda, Quorum have emerged as a successful distributive computing platform. Major consortium like Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, Hyperledger and R3 are formed with aim to come up with business solution. Today we have different blockchain application in public sector, finance, supply-chain, healthcare and IoT. In many industries people think blockchain will be transformative. Financial sector is most enthusiastic in adopting blockchain followed by supply chain management. Blockchain is closely looked at in India too. In 2018 Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued a white paper in order to identify the potential application areas of blockchain in Indian banking. NITI Aayog is working on national strategy for blockchain which will identify the area where country can implement blockchain. Blockchain is still new and has issues like scalability, security and privacy breaches, limited transaction loads, and high (computational) costs, besides its technical problem, adopting blockchain into Indian market system has its own specific challenges. This paper discusses the prospect of blockchain technology in India, its current position and likely problem in its adoptation to Indian market place. This paper also give overview about blockchain and its fundamental technologies and prominent blockchain platform, it also gives account of application area's in which blockchain is implemented successfully around the world.},

  abstract={Digitization is becoming part of almost everyone’s life, ranging from smartphones and tablets, smart devices automatically collecting information, to tools and scripting languages that are widely available and easy to use. This has recently been reflected in various university curricula, where courses such as computational thinking, and basic programming classes are now included in a broader range of (non-computer-science) programs. However, these programs often face challenges in such courses due to their diverse student body, with students often lacking profound digital competencies and technical background. While gender diversity aspects have been broadly studied in the past, other diversity dimensions such as ethnicity, age, or educational background have largely been neglected thus far. In this paper, we report on our experiences in teaching an introductory programming course to first-year Business Informatics bachelor students. After undergoing fundamental changes in our teaching concepts and the provided learning material, we explore what diversity factors play an important role when teaching programming to non-computer science students, and how diversity is perceived by lecturers and tutors. Our analysis confirms that a collaborative teaching concept positively supports female students and students with language barriers.},

The robot garden presented in this paper is a distributed multi-robot system capable of running autonomously or under user control from a simple graphical interface. Over 100 origami flowers are actuated with LEDs and printed pouch motors, and are deployed in a modular array around additional swimming and crawling folded robots. The garden integrates state-of-the-art rapid design and fabrication technologies with distributed systems software techniques to create a scalable swarm in which robots can be controlled individually or as a group. The garden can be used to teach basic algorithmic concepts through its distributed algorithm demonstration capabilities and can teach programming concepts through its education-oriented user interface.},

  pages={487-492},
  abstract={This paper introduces compact swarm intelligence. It presents a new estimation of distribution algorithm based on the swarm behavior of fireflies. The proposed algorithm is called the compact firefly optimizer (cFO). It uses a compact representation to store the population of the fireflies. Thus, the whole population is represented by a probabilistic distribution function. The compact swarm intelligence proposed allows the reduction of the computational capacity required to evolve the population toward the optimal solution. An important numerical test is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results obtained show that the proposed compact firefly optimizer (cFO) is very competitive. Furthermore, the new concepts of compact swarm robotics are also introduced. The algorithm is applied to describe the first compact swarm robotics system. The objective is to realize an optimal stable walking by bipedal robot. Discussions, propositions and analysis let to think to a new important starting point for an emerging field of compact swarm intelligence, robotics, search and optimization.},

This game presents a drag-and-drop interface and a classical typing interface and towards this approach, four different versions of the same game were developed. Each version of the game focuses on either creating a part of code or debugging (finding the errors in the code provided). The game enables the players to advance their programming skills and computational thinking by engaging them in problem-solving activities during the gameplay.

  year={2024},
  volume={17},
  number={},
  pages={498-513},
  abstract={Teaching programming is a topic that has generated a high level of interest among researchers in recent decades. In particular, multiple approaches to teaching visual programming have been explored, from the use of tools such as Scratch, robots, unplugged programming, or activities for the development of computational thinking. Despite the wide range of resources used, students generally tend to perform poorly academically and perceive learning visual programming as a complex and demotivating task. In this article, the TutoApp system is proposed together with a new methodology based on “Learning by Teaching,” where students create tutorials on their mobile devices to explain programming concepts to their peers. The hypothesis of this article is that the use of this tool improves learning outcomes and the level of student satisfaction. An experiment with a pre–posttest design has been carried out with 57 university students in an introductory programming course, 30 belonging to a control group (did not use TutoApp) and 27 belonging to the experimental group (used TutoApp). The findings indicate that the creation of tutorials with TutoApp significantly improved students' academic performance over those who did not use it, specifically in learning the loops and conditional control structures. However, it was observed that anxiety increased in all students while learning visual programming. The results of this study open the door to the validation of the use of systems and methodologies for creating tutorials for teaching visual programming to university students.},

  abstract={Role-Based Collaboration (RBC) is a computational thinking methodology where roles provide an underlying mechanism to facilitate abstraction, classification, separation of concerns, dynamics, and interactions. From a meta theoretical perspective, the specification of groups, roles and agents is a critical element of RBC. In consideration of the relationships and hierarchies faced by groups, roles and agents, we propose a minimal role playing logic system (MRPL) through substructural logic, which is polynomial in complexity, in support of RBC. From MRPL and RPLs extending from it, there are three levels of application, i.e., the global level governing how people organize agents to form a group; the concatenative level for role assignment with respect to logic and algebra, and the operational level governing properties, relations and structures that should appear in collaborative system design. From MRPL to RPLs, one can extend it to suit other appropriate applications.},

  year={2014},
  volume={},

  pages={1241-1246},
  abstract={Embodied interaction concerns the way that user senses the environment, acquires information, and exhibits intention by means of physical action. In a complex decision making scenario, which requires maintaining high level of attention continuously and deep understanding about the task and its context, the use of embodied interaction has the potential to promote thinking and learning. Creating a framework that allows decision makers to interact with information using the whole body in intuitive ways may offer cognitive advantages and greater efficiency. This paper proposes such a computational framework based on a Bayesian approach (coined BAN) to infer operators' focus of attention based on the operators' physical expressions. Then, utility theory is adopted in order to determine the best combinations of interaction modalities and feedback. Experiments involving five physical interaction modalities (touchless, glove-based, and step gestures, speech, and body balance) and two feedback modalities (visual and sound) were conducted to assess the proposed framework's performance. This also includes the likelihood of assessed attention from enhanced BANs and task performance as a function of the interaction and control modalities. Results show that physical expressions have a determining factor in the quality of the solutions in spatio-navigational type of problems.},

  abstract={The project Death and Burial Data: Ireland 1864-1922 (DBDIrl) examines the relationship between historical death registration data and burial data to explore the history of power in Ireland from 1864 to 1922. Its core Big Data arises from historical records from a variety of heterogeneous sources, some aspects are pre-digitized and machine readable. A huge data set (over 4 million records in each source) and its slow manual enrichment (ca 7,000 records processed so far) pose issues of quality, scalability, and creates the need for a quality assurance technology that is accessible to non-programmers. An important goal for the researcher community is to produce a reusable, high-level quality assurance tool for the ingested data that is domain specific (historic data), highly portable across data sources, thus independent of storage technology.This paper outlines the step-wise design of the finer granular digital format, aimed for storage and digital archiving, and the design and test of two generations of the techniques, used in the first two data ingestion and cleaning phases.The first small scale phase was exploratory, based on metadata enrichment transcription to Excel, and conducted in parallel with the design of the final digital format and the discovery of all the domain-specific rules and constraints for the syntax and semantic validity of individual entries. Excel embedded quality checks or database-specific techniques are not adequate due to the technology independence requirement. This first phase produced a Java parser with an embedded data cleaning and evaluation classifier, continuously improved and refined as insights grew. The next, larger scale phase uses a bespoke Historian Web Application that embeds the Java validator from the parser, as well as a new Boolean classifier for valid and complete data assurance built using a Model-Driven Development technique that we also describe. This solution enforces property constraints directly at data capture time, removing the need for additional parsing and cleaning stages. The new classifier is built in an easy to use graphical technology, and the ADD-Lib tool it uses is a modern low-code development environment that auto-generates code in a large number of programming languages. It thus meets the technology independence requirement and historians are now able to produce new classifiers themselves without being able to program. We aim to infuse the project with computational and archival thinking in order to produce a robust data set that is FAIR compliant (Free Accessible Inter-operable and Re-useable).},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={In this Research-to-Practice Full Paper, we report on CS Pathways, a middle school computer science (CS) curriculum developed as part of a researcher-practitioner partnership among two public universities and three urban school districts in the Northeast USA. The curriculum serves middle school students to develop apps for social impact. The partnership focuses on bridging the gap between STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and community and gender gap within STEM. The project is based on Culturally Responsive Pedagogy (CRP), which includes the importance of recognizing students’ culture in all facets of learning. The project employs a researcher-practitioner partnership (RPP) model, which recognizes that transformational change can occur in educational ecosystems that connect research, policy, practice, and community work.The project curriculum was collaboratively developed by CS researchers, teacher-practitioners, and school administrators. Middle school students develop their own apps that support socially relevant activities in their communities. Using the RPP process, continuous feedback from researchers, teacher-practitioners, and students shaped the curriculum design. Key feedback was collected via one-on-one meetings with the teacher-practitioners, which bridged the visions and knowledge among different groups of the project partners.The curriculum includes the areas of computing and society, digital tools and collaboration, computing systems, and computational thinking. The curriculum helps students develop a critical consciousness of the role they can play in affecting their communities through computing, and empower them to move beyond simply learning to code [1]. The curriculum strives to demonstrate how to integrate computing across middle school subjects in a culturally-responsive way and spread a powerful message of Computer Science for All. This paper advocates for the need for culturally-responsive computing, describes how it is integrated into teachers’ instruction, and presents the CS Pathways curriculum design.},

This may complicate the effective learning process of each student. In order to solve this problem, one of the original goals of intelligent educational systems is to guide every student to the most appropriate educational contents. So, the approach adopted in this paper is based on a framework called ArCARE (Conceptual Framework of Educational Resources Adaptation in Virtual Learning Environments), which allows adaptation of resources for students in VLEs, allowing the construction of their knowledge, using multi-agent system technology that handles an open learner model ontology. These ArCARE resources are recommendation and adaptation of collaborative activities such as Pedagogical Architectures for the students have a more effective learning of particular course content.

  abstract={An unstructured grid flow solver was implemented on a massively parallel computer, and benchmark computations were performed. The solver was a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code that performs first-order, steady-state solutions of the Euler equations. The parallel computer employed was the Connection Machine made by Thinking Machines, Corp. The CFD code was programmed in *Lisp, the accuracy of the code was verified, and numerous optimizations were implemented. Several benchmark runs were then made to assess and understand the impact of the code modifications and to obtain meaningful performance comparisons with other advanced computers.},

  abstract={In the context of large versatile platform for embedded real time system on chip, a fine grained dynamically reconfigurable architecture could be used as one possible computational resource. In order to manage efficiently this resource we need a specific OS kernel able to manage such a hardware adaptable architecture. Both the history of micro-processor based system and our previous work based on currently available FPGA devices led us to think that not only an OS kernel must be defined to handle an FGDRA but a FGDRA must also be designed to handle this OS kernel. This article relate our original work in this direction. OLLAF, an original FGDRA core that we have designed will be presented. A comparison with other methods used today using commercially available FPGA is also presented concerning the particular preemption service.},

  abstract={This research explored the degree of learning self-efficacy of machine learning experience (MLSE) and artificial intelligence learning anxiety (AILA) of elementary and junior high school teachers. The participants were in-service teachers in the technology domain. This research applied the AI2 Robot City, which is a computational thinking board game, to in-service teacher education. The learning content was image classification for AI application. Elementary and junior high school teachers operated the MIT App Inventor(MAI) and Personal Image Classifier(PIC) platform, and trained the model for practicing AI to implement supervised machine learning on the PIC platform. The learners then inserted the model they had trained into the block-based programming environment of MAI. They completed the smart phone app and used the app to recognize the board game cards so as to control the movement of the smart cars on the table map to meet the requirements of the task in the AI2 Robot City board game. In order to understand affective factors such as the self-efficacy and learning anxiety of the elementary and middle school teachers participating in the AI teacher training workshop, the MLSE and AILA scales were administered before and after the classes. A total of 28 samples were collected. The results showed that there was no significant difference between the MLSE of the elementary and junior high school teachers. However, the average AILA degree of the junior high school teachers was significantly higher than that of the elementary school teachers. It was found that AILA was significantly negatively correlated with MLSE. The elementary and junior high school teachers were confident that they could study AI-related courses. However, the AILA of the junior high school teachers was higher than that of the elementary school teachers. Therefore, more teacher training workshops on AI application can be conducted for junior high school teachers to generally improve their familiarity with AI application. Future research can further explore whether teachers will gradually improve their AILA and MLSE with time and as training courses increase.},

  abstract={In recent years, industries have been moving with tremendous speed towards "green thinking" as never before. Proceeding into a more circular economy will offer benefits such as reducing environmental burdens, enhancing the protection of raw material supply, increasing competition, promoting productivity, boosting sustainable economic growth and creating employment. Remanufacturing leads to circularity, while reverse supply chains pose difficulties. Closed loop supply chains are prioritized for reverse supply chain networks. However, alternative supply chains and different market actors make remanufacturing possible through open loops. In this study, a new integrated mathematical approach is proposed to address designing a multi-stage, multi-product and multi-period open loop reverse supply chain network which maximizes the profit and utilizes reverse logistics to benefit the environment in the most efficient way. The proposed approach presents a mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) that uses water treatment facility along with the common components of open loop reverse supply chain (OLSC). The objective determines the facility location and material flows between stages in each period. Using a realistic network instance, computational results are used to verify the feasibility of the study.},

  abstract={A Virtual Reality (VR) ambiance can simulate real-world scenarios and problems, allowing students to apply their theoretical knowledge to practical situations. The design of the VR ambiance should align with the learning objectives and provide relevant challenges and tasks that require students to use their computer technology skills to solve problems. A well-designed VR ambiance can encourage exploration and creativity in computer technology students. By providing a virtual space that allows experimentation and innovation, students can explore different approaches, test ideas, and think creatively when solving problems. This paper studies how students and professors evaluated the development of competencies during an extracurricular project for the development of a virtual interactive environment for learning a process. Designing an interactive virtual environment will require the implementation of various interactive elements, such as 3D objects, user interfaces, and animations. Students can apply their programming skills to create the necessary functionality in the virtual environment. To create an attractive and easy-to-use virtual environment, students will need to consider UX design principles. In this case, the competencies to be measured were: Solving problems generating efficient computational algorithms under models and tools of computer science and developing software applying process and quality standards of Software Engineering. To assess compliance with the development of competencies, it was decided to develop an interactive virtual environment; this is a process that involves several stages, from conceptualization to implementation and testing. The objectives of the virtual environment were established. In this case, it was decided to develop an environment that would help the user learn how to change a flat tire. A plan was created detailing how users will interact with the virtual environment. Early results show that more than 50% of the students outstandingly developed problem-solving competence, additionally, if we add the students who obtained a solid evaluation, the percentage of students who developed the competence in a more than acceptable way would go up to 93%. These results, also show that more than 70% of the students outstandingly developed software development competence. In addition, if we add the students who obtained a solid evaluation, the percentage of students who developed competence in a more than acceptable way would rise to 92%.},

  abstract={Programming has been part of Swedish elementary school curriculum for six years and the aim of this full paper is to find out how teachers can design programming activities so that students engage and learn. A mix-methods research project with a social semiotic, multimodal theoretical framework – Designs for learning – is used to investigate teaching and learning in a class during three years. The results in this small-scale study indicate that collaboration is a successful didactic design for programming lessons in school. Computational thinking is prevalent and both digital skills (such as coding) and digital competencies (such as understanding the impact of technology in society) are practiced and met in programming lessons merging Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics.},

  abstract={The climate of the planet is going through some mayor changes. Most of the climate scientists agree upon anthropological activities being the main cause of this, due to the CO2 and other GreenHouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Road transportation also contributes to air pollution and to the local pollution in big cities, due to the emissions of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and polluting gases such as NOx, CO, SO2 among others. Those problems and the continuous increase in emission limits given by regulators all over the world, are demanding for a change in the current transportation paradigm, leading to a completely electrified solution for both the private and public vehicles. This is particularly true for those cities that relay thoroughly on bus system as main public form of transport. Even though the Colombian capital, Bogota, is a big city with about 10 million people, it does not have a subway or other electric type of massive transport systems, but it has developed a big and articulated bus system. With the aim of shifting part of this system, namely the trunk lines of the Transmilenio company, to an electric one, this work analyses the problematic of the charging needs. To calculate the energy consumptions, computational simulations on two lines, C29 and B11, have been performed based on three different solutions proposed to address the charging problem. The aim of this work is the comparison of different technical solutions to find the best one in financial terms (also in the form of type and dimension of the bus accumulators in a true first principles thinking) and the estimation and inclusion of the buses’ cost.},
