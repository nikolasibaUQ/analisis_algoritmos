  abstract={How can learning be computed? Curriculum, using visual language as the motivational context with embedded computer science content was utilized in one college computer science class and two middle school technology classes. From the data collected in these three classes over the course of a semester, associated learning progressions were computed from several computational thinking patterns. By comparing the results (learning progressions), some obvious and some not so obvious indications emerged. We believe that the more obvious indications give credence to the less obvious, and hence the measurement tool. This comparison between middle school students and college students demonstrated that middle school students' learning progressions are slower than college level students (obvious), but middle school students' learning skill scores reached/surpassed the entry level scores of students in the college class after designing only two or more games. Consequently, these results tell us that this measurement tool although not validated yet, could measure accumulated learning in certain contexts. Although this is just the first "outing" of this tool these results strongly indicate that the tool provides an accurate measure of the concept, in this case, learning accumulation or transfer. The Scalable Game Design (SGD) project was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to improve computer science interest in middle schools. The goal of SGD is to use visual language programming software (Agentsheets) to introduce a more positive image of computer science through a game design course.},

  abstract={A game plays a very important role to children. Everything that is done through the game is easier to accept and longer to remember. This paper describes a method that, although it originated forty years ago, can provide surprisingly a lot to today's generation of students. The method helps in the development of computational thinking and computer-free programming in children at early school age. In particular, in this paper, the examples are given on how to use methods to realize and carry out learning outcomes according to the curriculum for the 1st grade of primary school and present a real example of their use in mathematics classes in teaching practice. The results of this work can be an incentive to all of those whose interest is the further development of learning programming and mathematics through a game in young children.},

  abstract={Educational robotics is a practice that has been disseminated in Brazil and in the world, allowing the inclusion of technology in the school environment through stimulating pedagogical activities for students, making them practice teamwork, fine motor coordination, and computational thinking, among other benefits. For the educational robotics classes to be executed in the most effective way, the teacher must be trained to use this tool, and from there propose and/or execute classes that use the technology to help in the teaching of curricular subjects in basic education. However, many teachers do not realize what can be possible with robotics in the classroom, and this often causes them not to choose to learn more about this technology. In this work, we developed a web system called Repo-Educ in which a teacher can access information about robotics lessons created by other teachers, generating ideas about how to apply robotics in their classroom. Using this system, it is possible to transform robotics education by combining knowledge. Even teachers who have never had contact with robotics can start using this technology in the classroom by replicating lessons that are proven to work by other teachers. The system is in the final stages of development to be made available to the educational robotics community.},

However, there is little work focus on the evaluation metrics for block-based python code. The past block-oriented evaluation metrics based on Computational Thinking (CT) were not language-oriented, and program volume was often ignored. In this paper, we propose a new evaluation metrics for block-based python code, which combines the CT dimensions and program volume. The experimental results show that the correlations between the proposed metrics and Halstead, McCabe complexity algorithms are both above 0.7, which is higher than Dr. Scratch.},

As a result, this study is to constructing a series of programming competence indicator for K-12 students by adopting Delphi study technique. This study invites 15 experts including experienced elementary and high schools teachers, to survey and provide suggestions for this indicator. After three rounds of Delphi study, this study completed 5-level programming competence, including detailed content of indicators, learning and instructional methods, and learning environments. The proposed indicators can be used for formal coding curriculum in schools systematically, and informal education such as self-directed learning or cram schools.},

The planning tool presented in this paper was used to engage elementary students in an activity to design and then create a video game using an agent-based programming environment. The design of the planning tool was informed by prior research and literature on concept development. The tool scaffolded the design process by having students (1) describe their game, (2) identify agents, (3) describe agent behavior, and (4) use those descriptions to identify useful algorithms. The set of algorithms used were called computational thinking patterns (CTPs), and sample code was provided for each CTP to assist the programming process. From the information provided by the student a summary was created to show needed agents and helpful programming code.},

There are strong indications that a creative approach in programming allows to pay attention to institutional and social requirements concerning computer science education. This includes the students' interest and motivation as well as their performance and knowledge acquisition. Even though, this has been discussed before, this paper presents a first basic structure of a didactic concept, enabling an integration of creative coding as an additional path for teaching computer science in schools in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Taking existing approaches into account, basic ideas of creative coding are identified and connected to the concepts of Computational Thinking.},

  title={A Type-2 Fuzzy Ontology and Its Application to Personal Diabetic-Diet Recommendation},

  pages={374-395},
  abstract={ It has been widely pointed out that classical ontology is not sufficient to deal with imprecise and vague knowledge for some real-world applications like personal diabetic-diet recommendation. On the other hand, fuzzy ontology can effectively help to handle and process uncertain data and knowledge. This paper proposes a novel ontology model, which is based on interval type-2 fuzzy sets (T2FSs), called type-2 fuzzy ontology (T2FO), with applications to knowledge representation in the field of personal diabetic-diet recommendation. The T2FO is composed of 1) a type-2 fuzzy personal profile ontology ( type-2 FPPO); 2) a type-2 fuzzy food ontology ( type-2 FFO); and 3) a type-2 fuzzy-personal food ontology (type-2 FPFO). In addition, the paper also presents a T2FS-based intelligent diet-recommendation agent ( IDRA), including 1) T2FS construction; 2) a T2FS-based personal ontology filter; 3) a T2FS-based fuzzy inference mechanism; 4) a  T2FS-based diet-planning mechanism; 5) a T2FS-based menu-recommendation mechanism; and 6) a T2FS-based semantic-description mechanism. In the proposed approach, first, the domain experts plan the diet goal for the involved diabetes and create the nutrition facts of common Taiwanese food. Second, the involved diabetics are requested to routinely input eaten items. Third, the ontology-creating mechanism constructs a T2FO, including a type-2 FPPO, a type-2 FFO, and a set of type-2 FPFOs. Finally, the  T2FS-based IDRA retrieves the built T2FO to recommend a personal diabetic meal plan. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can work effectively and that the menu can be provided as a reference for the involved diabetes after diet validation by domain experts. },

  year={2018},

  pages={151-1514},
  abstract={Mathematical knowledge is now often presented in a fragmented form. The problem is how to provide not just a sum of knowledge about the individual elements of mathematics, and some holistic system of representations of the world of mathematics. Integral system of ideas about the general properties and regularities of the objective world, a special form of systematization of knowledge is a scientific picture of the world, which is a qualitative generalization and philosophical synthesis of various scientific theories. For mathematical knowledge such a complete system of representations is a mathematical picture of the world. This problem is aggravated by the fact that there is no single point of view on the subject of mathematics, the positions of scientists differ greatly in the ratio of the various components of mathematical knowledge, in particular between discrete and continuous models in mathematics. The purpose of the article is to consider the way of forming an integral mathematical picture of the world. The historical analysis carried out in the article shows that in the history of mathematics there were repeated attempts to disrupt the balance between discrete and continuous models, attempts to reduce mathematics to one of these two types of models. However, in this case it became obvious the destruction of the integrity of the mathematical picture of the world, the need for a new, balanced perspective on the nature of mathematics. This need became especially acute in recent decades due to the growing role and place of discrete sections of mathematics in the context of computerization of society. To solve the problem, the article uses the trinitarian methodology and historical analysis. This methodology is more and more widely used in post-nonclassical outlook recently though sprouts of this thinking arose for a long time. This methodology presupposes the existence of a third element in addition to two binary oppositions, which is necessary for solving the problem of binary contradictions, as a measure of their compromise, as an arbitrator, as a condition for their existence. On the basis of the trinitarian methodology, the article shows that the unity of discrete and continuous models can be provided by the third component - fractal models. Fractality is just as fundamental a structural property of matter as discreteness and continuity. Thus, fractal geometry is not just a new branch of mathematics, it is one of the most important components of the mathematical picture of the world. Thus, with the help of this new scientific direction, it is possible to ensure the unity of discreteness and continuity, to form the integrity mathematical picture of the world among the students. Fractality is the fundamental structural property of matter, it is possible to ensure the synergy of discrete and continuous models, to form the integrity mathematical picture of the world. The study of fractal geometry helps to increase the motivation to study mathematics, the convergence of learning and research, enhance the aesthetic appeal of mathematics.},

  abstract={Most model based methodologies for engineering or policy design depend upon possession of a model that is predictively accurate. However, many systems of practical importance are now recognized as being both highly complex and composed of multiple interacting adaptive agents. For these systems, the construction of a model that accurately predicts the details of system behavior is essentially impossible, and any model for these systems is certain to be "wrong" in at least some details. If modeling and simulation is to be used to reason from what is known about such systems, we must understand how to think usefully with "wrong" models. This paper describes an approach based on exploratory modeling and adaptive strategies that can be used to make decisions about systems that are so complex their detailed behavior cannot be predicted. This approach seeks to find strategies that perform reasonably well over broad ranges of plausible futures-instead of devising strategies that are optimal for some particular best estimate model.},

  abstract={In this paper, we explore the innovative application of physical laws, specifically Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation, as metaphors within the realm of creative computing. By adapting gravitational concepts to measure the semantic “distances” and “attractions” between entities in textual data, we propose a computational model that interprets these relationships through the lens of physical force dynamics. This approach allows us to creatively visualise complex data interactions in a 3D space, where the metaphorical ‘mass’ and ‘distance’ between entities dictate their spatial arrangement based on calculated ‘gravitational’ forces. The core of our methodology involves the adaptation of the gravitational formula. We apply this model to a case study that demonstrates how entities with stronger semantic links are visually closer, creating imaginative and interpretative 3D scenes. This paper not only highlights the utility of physical metaphors in enhancing computational creativity but also opens new avenues for the application of such models in digital media, interactive art, and educational technologies. Further, this methodology can be extended to visualise and interpret health data, providing a novel representation of chronic conditions. By bridging physical theories and computational aesthetics, we provide a fresh perspective on data visualisation and creative computing.},

  abstract={Argumentation has been investigated mainly as an abstract formalism. However, when applying argumentation techniques in practice, abstract arguments need to be instantiated through a logic language into structured argumentation frameworks. Although structured argumentation frameworks provide practical use of argumentation, we think that computational arguments could give light to richer structures. In this work, we introduce a new category of computational arguments named M-arguments. M-arguments are not meta-arguments as the name could suggest, they are computational arguments with rich structure. Such a rich structure allows us to represent a large number of computational models of arguments. Further, M-arguments allows us not only to represent the usual structure of arguments, but also to represent relevant information that concerns the dialectic and rhetoric aspects of argumentation.},

  abstract={Artificial chemistries are mainly used to construct virtual systems that are expected to show behavior similar to living systems. In this study, we explore possibilities of applying an artificial chemistry to modeling natural biochemical systems—or, to be specific, molecular computing systems—and show that it may be a useful modeling tool for molecular computation. We previously proposed an artificial chemistry based on string pattern matching and recombination. This article first demonstrates that this artificial chemistry is computationally universal if it has only rules that have one reactant or two reactants. We think this is a good property of an artificial chemistry that models molecular computing, because natural elementary chemical reactions, on which molecular computing is based, are mostly unimolecular or bimolecular. Then we give two illustrative example models for DNA computing in our artificial chemistry: one is for the type of computation called the Adleman-Lipton paradigm, and the other is for a DNA implementation of a finite automaton. Through the construction of these models we observe preferred properties of the artificial chemistry for modeling molecular computing, such as having no spatial structure and being flexible in choosing levels of abstraction.},

  abstract={Summary <p>This chapter deals with ways of evaluating the coupling that exists between disparate antennas that find themselves installed in each other's vicinity on vehicular platforms or indeed any platform. Clarity on a number of subtle ideas from electromagnetic theory greatly facilitates the understanding of the co&#x2010;sited antenna coupling problem. Study of the coupling between platform&#x2010;mounted antennas is in principle the same as studying coupling between the elements in an array antenna. The chapter describes antenna operation, and inter&#x2010;antenna coupling, in the way a full&#x2010;wave computational electromagnetics (CEM) model &#x201c;thinks&#x201d; about it. The rigorous formulations on which full&#x2010;wave CEM models are based argue as follows: the field generated by the impressed sources if all of the antenna structure were to be removed is the incident field and exists in all of space. Separate CEM models are in effect used to set up each of reduced complexity models for the antennas.</p>},

  abstract={Undergraduate software engineering courses typically require students to work on team-based projects that reinforce disciplinary content and soft skills. At the same time, these students, particularly those at liberal arts institutions, are required to take courses that focus on civic issues, including on racial and ethnic inequality. Often, students perceive these courses to be outside their disciplinary areas, and may not comprehend how these topics are applicable to computer science and software engineering. This paper reports on the experience of Pulimood and Leigey as they and their students grappled with issues of racial injustice in the criminal justice system, and drew upon their own disciplinary backgrounds to apply computational thinking and software engineering principles to help the community better understand these issues and advocate for reform. The paper also describes the experience of teaching courses from different disciplines in a collaborative model, working closely with a local community partner to support its work on an identified social issue, and the learning outcomes, as well as the benefits and challenges of this approach. Recommendations and future directions are also discussed.},

  abstract={Intelligent recommendation plays an important role in the field of intelligent education, among which arithmetic problem recommendation is an important research field. Geometry arithmetic problems are a major category of arithmetic problems which play a crucial role in nurturing students’ spatial perception, logical thinking, and computational skills. This paper proposes a scene-enhanced BERT model for recommending geometry arithmetic problems. Firstly, a multi-layer classification task of geometric knowledge was constructed for fine-tuning the BERT model. Secondly, this BERT model is used to vectorize the problem to be queried and the problem text in the database. Finally, the query questions are matched with questions under the same knowledge points using vector similarity calculations with diversity correction and recommended according to the score. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method has achieved good efficiency and accuracy in recommending geometric arithmetic problems. Overall, this research offers an effective recommendation approach for the geometry arithmetic problem task, providing valuable insights for intelligent education field and tutoring system.},

  abstract={Explicit methods for the solution of fluid flow problems are of considerable interest in supercomputing. These methods parallelize well. The treatment of the boundaries is of particular interest both with respect to the numeric behavior of the solution, and the computational efficiency. We have solved the three-dimensional Euler equations for a twisted channel using second-order, centered difference operators, and a three stage Runge-Kutta method for the integration. Three different fourth-order dissipation operators were studied for numeric stabilization: one positive definite, [8], one positive semidefinite, [3], and one indefinite. The operators only differ in the treatment of the boundary. For computational efficiency all dissipation operators were designed with a constant bandwidth in matrix representation, with the bandwidth determined by the operator in the interior. The positive definite dissipation operator results in a significant growth in entropy close to the channel walls. The other operators maintain constant entropy. Several different implementations of the semidefinite operator obtained through factoring of the operator were also studied. We show the difference both in convergence rate and robustness for the different dissipation operators, and the factorizations of the operator due to Eriksson. For the simulations in this study one of the factorizations of the semidefinite operator required 70 - 90% of the number of iterations required by the positive definite operator. The indefinite operator was sensitive to perturbations in the inflow boundary conditions. The simulations were performed on a 8,192 processor Connection Machine system model CM-2. Full processor utilization was achieved, and a performance of 135 Mflops/s in single precision was obtained. A performance of 1.1 Gflops/s for a fully configured system with 65,536 processors was demonstrated.},

  abstract={We derive a lower bound on the interprocessor information transfer required for computing a function in a distributed network configuration. The bound is expressed in terms of the function's derivatives, and we use it to exhibit functions whose computation requires a great deal of interprocess communication. As a sample application, we give lower bounds on information transfer in the distributed computation of some typical matrix operations. Traditional measures of computational complexity, such as the number of primitive operations or memory cells required to compute functions, do not form an adequate framework for assessing the complexity of computations carried out in distributed networks. Even in the relatively straightforward situation of memoryless processors arranged in highly structured configurations, Gentleman [4] has demonstrated that data movement, rather than arithmetic operations, can often be the significant factor in the performance of parallel computations. And for the more general kinds of distributed processing, involving arbitrary network configurations and distributed data bases, the situation is correspondingly more complex. This paper addresses the problem of measuring computational complexity in terms of the interprocess communication required when a computation is distributed among a number of processors. More precisely, we model the distributed computation of functions which depend upon large amounts of data by assuming that the data is partitioned into disjoint subsets, and that a processor is assigned to each subset. Each processor (which we can think of as a node in a computational network) computes some values based on its own "local" data, and transmits these values to other processors, which are able to use them in subsequent local comutations. This "compute locally and share information" procedure is repeated over and over until finally some (predetermined) processor outputs the value of the desired function. In measuring the complexity of such computations we will be concerned, not with the individual local computations, but rather with the total information transfer, i.e., the total number of values which must be transmitted between processors. We derive a lower bound on the total information transfer required for computing a function in a distributed network. The bound is expressed in terms of the function's derivatives, and we use it to exhibit functions whose computation requires a great deal of interprocess communicaion. As a sample application, we give lower bounds on information transfer in the distributed computation of some typical matrix operations.},

  abstract={Sensor network is one of the authoritative leading technology of current century. Security is the main concern for everything whether it is for wired based networks or wireless based networks. So far, many of the researches have thought to physically implement the sensor nodes and sensor networks for secure communications but they did not think over it for security perspective. Sensor network works in very resource constraint environment. Due to these security reasons, we present various protocols to provide the basic needs of data security that are: confidentiality, authentication, freshness and authenticated broadcasting because this broadcasting requires some techniques or protocols to securely communicate with other sensor node(s). Other issues in sensor networks are power management, computation overhead and low memory capacity.},

  abstract={For Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) to reach their potential as a mainstream educational technology through employing experiential activities, they need assessment rubrics that are easy to execute and measure. This paper presents a study that investigates the use of automatically collected metrics in a 3D VLE along with metrics related to the learning process derived from established assessment criteria for higher order skills such as critical thinking, communication, and collaboration. Our study results provide supporting evidence that learning process metrics collected from a 3D VLE can be used for assessing higher order skills to compliments instructor's understanding of student's skills levels and to provide the necessary support during the learning process.},

  abstract={In this paper a brief survey is provided on a novel approach to adaptive nonlinear control developed at Budapest Tech in the past few years. Since this problem tackling is mainly based on simple geometric and algebraic considerations a brief historical summary is given on the antecedents to exemplify the advantages of geometric way of thinking in Natural Sciences. Following that the most popular branches of the classical and novel, Soft Computing (SC) based robust and adaptive approaches are analyzed with especial emphasis on the supposed need and the consequences of obtaining complete, accurate, and permanent models either for the system to be controlled or to the control situation as a whole. Following that, in comparison to the above mentioned more traditional methods, our novel approach is summarized that has the less ambitious goal of obtaining only partial, incomplete, temporal, and situation-dependent models that require continuous refreshment via observing the behavior of the controlled system in the given actual situation. It will be shown how simple geometric considerations can be used for developing a simple iterative learning control for Single Input - Single Output (SISO) systems the conditions of the convergence of which is easy to satisfy by choosing very simple and primitive initial system models and roughly chosen control parameters. Finally it will be shown how the most attractive mathematical properties of the fundamental symmetry groups of Natural Sciences can be utilized for the generalization of our approach to the control of Multiple Input - Multiple Output (MIMO) systems. The already achieved results are exemplified via simulation, and the possible directions of the future research are briefly outlined, too.},

  abstract={In higher education enormous datasets exist about learners, their learning and the background in which they study. The educational knowledge of the learner's is improved, making use of different approaches. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the problems faced by the learner with the traditional teaching method and to enhance the teaching method and learning environment that improve the resulting ratio for providing healthier employment to the learner. The proposed work uses a novel teaching, observing the cognitive skills of the learner by changing the classroom environment. The learner's learning is improved with a positive approach in teaching, enriching the thinking ability and creating a stress-free environment as learning should be made an enjoyable moment. A real-time dataset is formed with the teaching and learning environment and analysis of the dataset is made to the Naive Bayes algorithm. Different metrics are evaluated to show the increased performance of the learner's with a positive approach in the learning environment.},

  abstract={The observed growth trend of the wireless communications market will drive the development of new wireless systems, including equalizers. Linear equalization is still a relatively low computational demand and easy-to- implement solution that may increase reliability in low data rate devices such as the ones required for IoT systems and wireless sensor networks. However, the relationship between the mean squared error (MSE) and the matrix correlation of the Least Squares (LS) estimation procedure, with the bit error rate (BER) of the system, has not been fully investigated. This paper presents a description of the simulated BER behavior, caused by the influence of the matrix correlation and MSE, through a causal analysis derived from a systems thinking approach. Then, it is proposed a descriptive hypothesis of the main cause and effect relationships involved in the generation of the BER behavior, using different training sequences in the LS optimization procedure.},
