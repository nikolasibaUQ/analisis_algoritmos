  abstract={This paper discusses how to reveal the cognitive operation of human being from the perspective of granular computing, and discusses the uncertainty, ambiguity and other basic issues of cognition, and distinguishes, judges and identifies its link with thought operation. Human brain can only receive messages of different sensory attributes. A thing's state, movement and change process are reflected by its attributes and change process. Set up a granular computing model based on attributes and the judgment criterion change process and work out the basic logic rules for granular computing. The results show that this method can reflect the identification and judgment process with the attributes of uncertainty. At the same time, messages on granular conversion can be fully expressed through the definition of qualitative mapping, so as to better reveal the essential reason for ambiguous cognition of human. This model provides a new convenient tool for the study and stimulation of human's advanced intelligence and image thinking.},

  abstract={Visual perception is, by large, the main source of information used by humans when driving. Therefore, it is natural and appropriate to rely heavily on vision analysis for autonomous driving, as done in most projects. However, there is a significant difference between the common approach of vision in autonomous driving, and visual perceptions in humans when driving. Essentially, image analysis is often regarded as an isolated and autonomous module, which high level output drives the control modules of the vehicle. The direction here presented is different, we try to take inspiration from the brain architecture that makes humans so effective in learning tasks as complex as the one of driving. There are two key theories about biological perception grounding our development. The first is the view of the thinking activity as a simulation of perceptions and action, as theorized by Hesslow. The second is the Convergence-Divergence Zones (CDZs) mechanism of mental simulation connecting the process of extracting features from a visual scene, to the inverse process of imagining a scene content by decoding features stored in memory. We will show how our model, based on semi-supervised variational autoencoder, is a rather faithful implementation of these two basic neurocognitive theories.},

  abstract={This paper challenges the current thinking for building High Performance Computing (HPC) Systems, which is currently based on the sequential computing also known as the von Neumann model, by proposing the use of Novel systems based on the Dynamic Data-Flow model of computation. The switch to Multi-core chips has brought the Parallel Processing into the mainstream. The computing industry and research community were forced to do this switch because they hit the Power and Memory walls. Will the same happen with HPC? The United States through its DARPA agency commissioned a study in 2007 to determine what kind of technologies will be needed to build an Exaflop computer. The head of the study was very pessimistic about the possibility of having an Exaflop computer in the foreseeable future. We believe that many of the findings that caused the pessimistic outlook were due to the limitations of the sequential model. A paradigm shift might be needed in order to achieve the affordable Exascale class Supercomputers.},

  volume={},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Currently, in the field of Granular Computing, parameterized granularity has been widely explored by many scholars. Notably, the multi-granularity model for continuous parameters has also been attracted extensive attention. Based on such a model, it is often necessary to consider multiple granularities to evaluate the significance of candidate condition attributes in solving problems oriented to attribute reduction, which may lead to high time consumption. In view of this, one acceleration algorithm based on multi-granularity attribute reduction (MGAR) for continuous parameters is designed to decrease the time consumption of acquiring reduct. In fact, the acceleration method we proposed is on the basis of the thinking of positive approximation. Specifically, the iterations of evaluating and selecting condition attributes are carried out on the progressively decreased universe instead of the entire sample space. The experimental results over 10 UCI datasets show that the acceleration algorithm not only can effectively accelerate the process of searching reduct, but also can generate the same reduct with traditional approach.},

  abstract={This paper describes our experience teaching discrete-event simulation to several Engineering branches and Computer Science students. In our courses we emphasize the importance of conceptual modelling rather than the simulation tools used to build a model. We think that in discrete-event simulation university courses it is more important to provide knowledge to students to develop and analyze conceptual models than focusing in a specific simulation tool that will be industry dependent. Focusing in conceptual modelling with the support of a well-known simulation software provide the student with skills to create a model and then translate it to any simulator. Our courses use the Petri Net (PN) methodology by incrementing the complexity of models and PN using: Place-Transition PN, Timed PN and Colored Timed PN. A PN simulator is used to analyze the conceptual model and different rules and procedures are provided to match PN conceptual model to Arena simulation software.},

  abstract={Since the 1970's, the scientific field of model-based performance and dependability evaluation has been flourishing. Starting with breakthroughs in the area of closed queueing networks in the 1970's, the 1980's brought new results on state-based methods, such as those for stochastic Petri nets and matrix-geometric methods, whereas the 1990's introduced process algebra-type models. Since the turn of the century, techniques for stochastic model checking are being introduced, to name just a few major developments. The applicability of all these techniques has been boosted enormously through Moore's law; these days, stochastic models with tens of millions of states can easily be dealt with on a standard desktop or laptop computer. A dozen or so dedicated conferences serve the scientific field, as well as a number of scientific journals. However, for the field as a whole to make progress, it is important to step back, and to consider how all these as-such important developments have really changed the way computer and communication systems are being designed and operated. The answer to this question is most probable rather disappointing. I do observe a rather strong discrepancy between what is being published in top conferences and journals, and what is being used in real practice. Blaming industry for this would be too easy a way out. Currently, we do not see model-based performance and dependability evaluation as key step in the design process for new computer and communication systems. Moreover, in the exceptional cases that we do see performance and dependability evaluation being part of a design practice, the employed techniques are not the ones referred to above, but instead, depending on the application area, techniques like discrete-event simulation on the basis of hand-crafted simulation programs (communication protocols), or techniques based on (non-stochastic) timed-automata or timeless behavioral models (embedded systems). In all these cases, however, the scalability of the employed methods, also for discrete-event simulation, forms a limiting factor. Still, industry is serving the world with ever better, faster and more impressive computing machinery and software! What went wrong? When and why did ?our field? land on a side track? In this presentation I will argue that it is probably time for a change, for a change toward a new way of looking at performance and dependability models and evaluation of computer and communication systems, a way that is, if you like, closer to the way physicists deal with very large scale systems, by applying different type of abstractions. In particular, I will argue that computer scientist should ?stop counting things?. Instead, a more fluid way of thinking about system behavior is deemed to be necessary to be able to evaluate the performance and dependability of the next generation of very large scale omnipresent systems. First successes of such new approaches have recently been reported. Will be witness a paradigm shift in the years to come?},

Fortunately, MR technology provides us with the possibility of solving the safety issues and the space-time constraints, while the theory of human needs provides us with a way to think about designing a comfortable and stimulant MR system with realistic visual presentation and interaction. This study combines with the theory of human needs to propose a new needs model for virtual experiment. Based on this needs model, we design and develop a comprehensive MR system called MagicChem to verify the needs model. User study shows MagicChem that satisfies the needs model is better than the MR experimental environment that partially meet the needs model. In addition, we explore the application of the needs model in VR environment.},

  pages={120-125},
  abstract={Solid model abstraction is an integral part of parallel and process design. It is required for simulation and optimisation of the design and consists of retrieving a simplified model from the solid one, with appropriate dimension reduction and details removal. Unfortunately, current CAD systems do not provide the means for easy simplification of forms. Ongoing research efforts on abstraction yield some possible approaches. These attempt to generate the abstract model using expert systems, medial axis transforms or medial surfaces. A feature-based approach is presented. Analysts usually think about objects in terms of sets of forms rather than in terms of geometrical and topological entities. So, given an object and its description in terms of form features, the approach constructs a simplified model of this object using morphological information of the form features. The abstraction process has two parts: simplification and idealization. The simplification part removes any non-pertinent features from the initial model, while the idealization part idealizes the resulting objects according to the goal of the analysis.},

  year={2011},

  abstract={In the history of artificial intelligence (AI), primary agent focuses have been external environments, outside incentives, and behavioral responses. Internal operation mechanisms (i.e., attending to the self in the same manner as human self-awareness) have never been a concern for AI agent. Obviously, the learning concepts by which one pays attention to oneself has always been ignored by artificial intelligence researchers. However, we integrated a self-awareness mechanism into an agent's learning architecture, so that not only are an agent's thinking and behaviors closer to the ways that people operate, but also to allow agent-based social simulations to be even more akin to the real world. Our research objectives include: a) to propose a self-awareness agent model including external learning mechanism and internal cognitive capacity combining with having super-ego and ego personalities; b) apply an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game to represent the conflicts caused by public good and private interest in an agents' society, and analyze the effects of an agent's self-awareness capacity upon its individual performance and social cooperation behavior. Our goal is to show the ability of a cognitive learning model to improve intelligent agent performance and support collaborative agent behavior. We believe additional simulations and analyses will indicate enriched social benefits, even in cases where only a few agents achieve limited self-awareness capabilities.},

  abstract={Targeted malware evolved in recent years and that with encrypted payload appeared. The evolved targeted malware is difficult to be detected by static analysis and dynamic analysis on a virtual or stand-alone machine. The key for encryption is generated from information of a target computer. Therefore, the key is only known by an attacker and a victim computer. However, any targeted malware must collecting information of victim computer and we think this is a feature of targeted malware. First, we introduce our proposed method which detects targeted malware with encrypted payload by finding features of the collection behavior with machine learning. As a result, all test samples were classified to benign in our evaluation. We considered that features of our simulated samples are different from those of actual samples. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate of the difference and consider how we can create more precise simulated samples. We created map images of matched n-grams of our simulated samples with actual malware samples. We found hints of more precise simulated samples by looking distribution of the matched n-grams.},

  abstract={For collaborative learning to be successful, the instructor must carefully plan the formation of student groups. Typically, a teacher uses a set of conditions inferred from certain student parameters such as individual proficiency, learning and thinking styles, team-related traits and personality traits. While all of these parameters are instructor-driven, it is also favorable to get the teammate preferences of the students. Based on this, an instructor strategy can thus be generalized as an assignment problem that satisfies the most number of predetermined conditions based on these parameters and the most number of teammate preferences. In this paper, the generic model was implemented using constraint logic programming. Cohorts produced are evaluated based on the parameter constraints satisfied and on the number of teammate preferences satisfied. As such, the study demonstrates not only the feasibility of applying Constraint Logic Programming in the field of computer-supported group formation but also demonstrates that an instructor strategy can both include parameters decided by the instructor and teammate preferences from students.},

  abstract={Lately, deep learning has become increasingly popular in resolving issues across multiple domains, including medical image analysis. This research introduces a process based on deep convolutional neural networks to diagnose Alzheimer's disease and its various stages by utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Identifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) in elderly individuals can be quite difficult. This is because it harms the brain cells related to memory and thinking abilities, and it's hard to tell apart from normal brain patterns in scans. Detecting it needs a special way to represent features for sorting it out. Deep learning methods can acquire such representations from the MRI data. In this paper, five different transfer learning models are trained in 15 binary classifiers, each of them can classify two of Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Cognitively Normal (CN) classes. This method finds the best transfer learning model for classifying each binary comparison. The proposed technique results in best accuracy of 92% for the AD vs. CN classifier, 94% for the AD vs. MCI classifier, and 72% for the MCI vs. CN classifier, which shows the effectiveness of transfer learning in distinguishing the AD vs. CN and the AD vs. MCI cases.},

Of all three modelling approach, Multi Agent System (MAS) model is considered as the best approach, in which it provides a realistic insight into evacuation process by including the human factor. Still, it leaves much room for improvement. This paper proposes an algorithm composed of two popular techniques from the field of Game Artificial Intelligence (Game AI), namely Behaviour Tree and Utility-Based AI, which will be applied in the decision making process of an agent.

  abstract={Ethics should be a practice, not a checkbox. Data scientists want to answer questions about individuals and society using the vast torrent of data that flows around us. Machine learning practitioners want to develop and connect complex models of the world and use them safely in critical situations. Ethical issues can be seen as getting in the way of the core idea and form pain points around managing, using and learning from data, as well as designing human-centric and ethical systems. This is because there is a design gap around ethics in data science and machine learning: the tools that we use do not support ethical data use, which means that data scientists and machine learning practitioners, already engaged in technically complex, multidisciplinary work, must add another dimension to their thinking. This work proposes and outlines an infrastructure and framework that can support in-the-moment ethical decision making and recording, as well as post-hoc audits and ethical model deployment.},

  abstract={The present study is based on developing a Green and Sustainable software because in the present-day computing devices are used for all kinds of purposes and they consume a lot of energy to perform these services. The ICT sector itself consumes a lot of energy so there is a need to think of alternatives that can reduce the level of energy consumption, thus, green ICT practice can be a good option. There is, however, a scarcity of researches that explains how the maintenance of green knowledge in ICT software development may be implemented. Since we recognize that software development process (SDL) plays an essential role in enabling the ICT community, uncontrolled green knowledge in developing software that would lead to the dilemma of failing to satisfy both the community's business and environmental requirements. Therefore, this research will concentrate on presenting a methodology applying an innovative model for managing the green software development and implementation. Keeping this concern in mind the present paper is going to provide a Green and Sustainable software model which can be used in green ICT practices and will be helpful in reducing the energy consumption used by computers.},

  abstract={Summary form only given. Mathematics is characterized by its method of gaining knowledge, namely reasoning. The automation of reasoning has seen significant advances over the past decades and, thus, the expectation was that these advances would also have significant impact on the practice of doing mathematics. However, so far, this impact is small. We think that the reason for this is the fact that automated reasoning so far concentrated on the automated proof of individual theorems whereas, in the practice of mathematics, one proceeds by building up entire theories in a step-by-step process. This process of exploring mathematical theories consists of the invention of notions, the invention and proof of propositions (lemmas, theorems), the invention of problems, and the invention and verification of methods (algorithms) that solve problems},

  abstract={As one of the most influential artificial intelligence programming languages, Prolog can naturally express human’s thinking and reasoning process. Thus, it has been widely applied in mechanical theorem proving, robot, intelligent planning, etc. However, the reasoning process of traditional Prolog is inefficient since it requires a lot of backtracking. This paper presents a novel linear reduction model different from the previous prolog derivation--generalized and/or graph search model, which can clearly represent variable (binding) constraints, so no backtracking is needed. In this model, a successful derivation of Prolog corresponds to a solution sub-graph of the corresponding generalized and/or graph. Therefore, the prolog reasoning is transformed into a searching process without backtracking, which can be parallel executed and greatly improves the efficiency of the prolog deduction. Furthermore, we discuss the transformation of artificial intelligence heuristic search technology, which is mature in both theory and practice, to Prolog reasoning, and obtain a more effective algorithm.},
