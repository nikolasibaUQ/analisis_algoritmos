  abstract={Contribution: This research illuminates information entropy’s efficacy as a pivotal educational tool in programming, enabling the precise quantification of algorithmic complexity and student abstraction levels for solving P problems. This approach can provide students quantitative, comparative insights into the differences between optimal and student implemented solution, and allowing educators to offer targeted feedback, thereby optimizing the learning and abstraction processes in algorithm design through deliberate practice. Background: Abstraction is considered one of the most impor11 tant skills in problem solving. Many studies in programming have shown that higher abstraction capability can significantly simplify problems, reduce program complexity and improve efficiency. However, it is difficult to develop criteria to measure the level of abstraction, and there is still a lack of relevant systematic research. Research Questions: 1) How can students’ abstraction ability in programming be effectively measured? 2) How to develop programming education and training methods based on the measurement of abstraction ability? Methodology: Forty-six grade 10 students participated in the experiment, divided into two groups for programming train23 ing using information-entropy-based assessment and traditional learning methods. Their level of computational thinking, algo25 rithmic efficiency improvements, and test scores were used to measure performance and to analyze the effectiveness of the training methods. Findings: Through empirical research, this article finds that information-entropy-based assessment can reflect the differences in problem solving among students possessing varying capa31 bilities. Information entropy can be crucial for evaluating and improving students’ abstraction performance and algorithm efficiency.},

  abstract={In advance to the present study, the authors introduced a method which makes it possible to calculate the entropy of natural language digital texts, focusing on word-processed texts, presentations, and webpages. This entropy reveals that the more underdeveloped documents are, the more demanding their content-related modification becomes. It was also found that the time and data required to complete a modification task in an erroneous document is several times more than in its correct counterpart. This finding leads to the end-user paradox: the less trained end-users are, the more errors they make, and the modification of their documents requires more resources. To resolve these discrepancies, the present study defines the sustainability rate of natural language digital texts which calculates the losses – the waste of human resources, time, workspace, computers, energy, frustration, working in bees, losing data – generated by negligent text management. Furthermore, we present examples of how manual and enumerated lists behave to modifications in a 213-page long document and conclude from our investigations that while the waste of human and machine resources occurs repeatedly in erroneous documents, the sustainability rate remains low. To prove the necessity of correction, we cleared the sample document, which took approximately 67 hours of two experts of our research group ( $2\times67$  hours). With this method, we found that the correction of errors can be extremely demanding, but uses resources only once, and further modifications in the now correct document need only the content-required amount of time, activities, entropy, and resources, in accordance with the expectations of the person intended to update the document. To correct documents, we present the Error Recognition Model, which is proved effective and efficient in digital education. All our findings indicate that both education and industry should adapt the presented approach (1) to develop students’ and end-users’ computational thinking skills, (2) to manage and take advantage of errors, (3) to recognize connections between the structure of the text and the complex word processing tools, (4) to pay attention to digital sustainability – beyond hardware and software development and recycling – with a focus on the human factor. Recently, the Error Recognition Model is a reactive problem-solving approach, whose effectiveness is justified. However, the near future is to run parallel the reactive and proactive uses of this approach, while if we look far into the future, the proactive use to digital born natural language texts should dominate.},

  abstract={Computational thinking, problem-solving and the ability to apply knowledge; these and a plethora of other skills are essential for success in both personal and professional life. In order to be able to develop those skills in their students, the teachers themselves need to possess them. This paper focuses on female future lower primary school teachers who, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, took an online course on algorithmization and programming, having little or no prior knowledge and skills. The completion rate depended not only on the students' motivation and willingness to learn, but mainly on the content and structure of the course, which was completely modified and made into an online course. The results were more than surprising. The students were able to complete the activities included in the course. Moreover, those activities inspired them to create their own activities, which they may be able to use in their future classes.},

  abstract={The construction industry is a new avenue for big data and data science with sensors and cyber-physical systems deployed in the field. Construction students need to develop computational thinking skills to help make sense of this data, but existing data science environments designed with textual programming languages create a significant barrier to entry. To bridge this gap, we introduce Octave, an end-user programming environment designed to help non-expert programmers analyze spatiotemporal data (e.g., as gathered by a GPS sensor) in an interactive graphical user interface. To aid exploration and understanding, Octave's design incorporates a high degree of liveness, highlighting the interconnection between data, computation, and visualization. We share the underlying design principles behind Octave and details about the system design and implementation. To evaluate Octave, we conducted a usability study with students studying construction. The results show that non-programmer construction students were able to learn Octave easily and were able to effectively use it to solve domain-specific problems from construction education. The participants appreciated Octave's liveness and felt they could easily connect it to real-life problems in their field. Our work informs the design of future accessible end-user programming environments for data analysis targeting non-experts.},

  title={Longitudinal Analysis of Linguistic flexibility of Value-motivated Groups}, 
  year={2018},
  volume={},

  pages={2951-2959},
  abstract={Increasing globalization of the world leads to an emerging need for ways to analysis and understand groups from different cultures and ideologies. Researchers have used written text as a medium to examine political discourse and analyze value-motivated groups. Previous works showed that computational linguistic analysis can be performed to infer the flexibility of value-motivated groups from their writings. The main premise of these works is that text can bring insights into individuals' and groups' way of thinking, and potentially, behaviour. While existing works provide viable solutions for characterizing groups' ideological behaviour, they perform their analyses over all text published by the groups. However, researchers have found that religious and value-motivated groups can't be analyzed collectively as they regularly evolve. To address this gap, we analyze the performance of existing methods to single documents. Experimental results show that previous features (e.g., use of pronouns and judgment statements) used to predict groups' flexibility are less predictive for single documents' flexibility. We show that a newly added feature regarding the identity of a group provides a significant contribution to the prediction process. Furthermore, due to the unbalanced nature of our data, we propose a weighting scheme for linear regression based on the inter-group variance. Results indicate that a weighted least squares significantly outperforms a traditional least squares approach. This work brings new insights into the characteristics of different linguistic and performative signals, and their relationship to the linguistic flexibility of groups. It also provides a decision making support tool for practical use by practitioners.},

  abstract={A problem based learning pedagogy has paved its pathway into teaching and learning standing as one of the effective contributors in the teaching and learning process. With the varying institutional philosophies, the methodology has ample scope for improvements when it comes to its design and delivery. This paper proposes a method of using abstraction from computational thinking to construct knowledge in problem based learning process. Arriving at principles is one of the major objectives of learning process and also contributes towards the self-directed learning. A paper piece activity with shapes and sizes is designed to create free and themed scenarios and further analyzed with various attributes and its contribution towards the knowledge construction process. The paper presents a model and discusses the various perspectives of the activity. The method is found to be an effective approach to design problems that contribute to holistic learning.

  pages={1869-1882},
  abstract={Cloud adoption in industrial sectors, such as process, manufacturing, health care, and finance, is steadily rising, but as it grows, the risk of targeted cyberattacks has increased. Hence, effectively defending against such attacks necessitates skilled cybersecurity professionals. Traditional human-based cyber-physical education is resource intensive and faces challenges in keeping pace with rapidly evolving technologies. This research focuses on the main advantages of incorporating large language models into cyber-physical education. The ChatGPT platform serves as an online tool to educate students on fundamentals, cyberattacks, and defense concepts, fostering the development of a new generation cybersecurity experts. The proposed learning approach adheres to the ChatGPT-assisted learn–apply–create model. Responding to prompts provided by the learners, the learning phase engages in conceptual learning, the applying phase involves mathematical modeling of various cyberattacks, and the creating phase develops MATLAB program to incorporate attacks into sensor measurements for the experiment and entails developing the necessary attack detection approaches. The effectiveness of the detection method developed by ChatGPT is assessed in both the simulation and real-time scenarios using a J-type thermocouple. The impact of the proposed learning platform over traditional learning methods is evaluated through an extensive comparative feedback analysis on the learner's foundational concepts, computational thinking, programming efficacy, and motivation. The study proved that integrating ChatGPT into engineering education enables students to swiftly learn cyber-physical fundamentals, comprehend and model cyberattacks, create new attack signatures, and contribute to developing detection algorithms. Such integration provides the learners with essential industrial skills crucial in modern industries.},

  abstract={This full research paper focuses on the design of a Teaching Practices Management System (TPMS) which supports the sharing of teaching practices (TPs) amongst computer science instructors. Many years of valuable TPs can be lost due to academic retirement when no competent knowledge management system is available for recording these TPs. Consequently, novice teachers are currently facing critical challenges when delivering subject knowledge that relates to algorithms, programming and the development of computational thinking skills without the benefit of others' experience. After a study of the relevant literature, it could be seen that far too little attention has been paid to the capturing and sharing of TPs which are not easily expressed or communicated in visual or verbal terms. Thus, we design and then demonstrate a Teaching Practices Management System (TPMS) which supports the capturing of TPs. A quantitative and a qualitative evaluation of users' experiences of employing the system shows that instructors are satisfied with it and are mostly positive about its features. The findings of this study hold considerable promise in relation to developing engaging and effective knowledge sharing systems for use by academic instructors.},

  abstract={In recent decades, computer science (CS) has undergone remarkable growth and diversification. Creating attractive, social, or hands-on games has already been identified as a possible approach to get teenagers and young adults interested in CS. However, overcoming the global gap between the interest and participation of men and women in CS is still a worldwide problem. To address this challenge, we present a multiplayer game that is used in a workshop setting to motivate girls to program through a 3D game environment. The paper aims to expand the educational landscape within computer science education by offering a motivating and engaging platform for young women to explore programming quests in a collaborative environment. The study involved 235 girls and 50 coaches for the workshop evaluation and a subset of 20 participants for an in-game analysis. In this paper, we explore the engagement in programming and assess the cognitive workload while playing and solving programming quests within the game, as well as the learning experience and the outcome. The results show that the positive outcomes of the workshop underscore the effectiveness of a game-based collaborative learning approach to get girls interested in computer science activities. The variety of solutions found for the different tasks demonstrates the creativity and problem-solving skills of the participants and underlines the effectiveness of the workshop in promoting critical thinking and computational skills.},

  abstract={In recent years, the rapid development of cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain technology has revived Szabo’s original idea of smart contracts, i.e., computer protocols that are designed to automatically facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation and implementation of digital contracts without central authorities. Smart contracts can find a wide spectrum of potential application scenarios in the digital economy and intelligent industries, including financial services, management, healthcare, and Internet of Things, among others, and also have been integrated into the mainstream blockchain-based development platforms, such as Ethereum and Hyperledger. However, smart contracts are still far from mature, and major technical challenges such as security and privacy issues are still awaiting further research efforts. For instance, the most notorious case might be “The DAO Attack” in June 2016, which led to more than $50 million Ether transferred into an adversary’s account. In this paper, we strive to present a systematic and comprehensive overview of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, aiming at stimulating further research toward this emerging research area. We first introduced the operating mechanism and mainstream platforms of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, and proposed a research framework for smart contracts based on a novel six-layer architecture. Second, both the technical and legal challenges, as well as the recent research progresses, are listed. Third, we presented several typical application scenarios. Toward the end, we discussed the future development trends of smart contracts. This paper is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts.},

  pages={23046-23052},
  abstract={The foreign object doped in the conveying belt is the most important factor to cause the tearing of the conveying belt. In order to solve the problem of low accuracy and poor real-time performance of foreign object detection, a new method based on improved Nanodet is proposed in this paper. The hardware of conveyor belt foreign object detection system is designed with ARM processor, and the system software is designed based on Android. It uses a conveyor belt foreign object detection system to detect foreign object. In order to detect foreign object images, a better Nanodet model is suggested. In order to increase detection accuracy while preserving processing speed, the model uses SIoU in place of the original position loss function. When the enhanced Nanodet model is applied to the conveyor belt foreign object detection system, the image of the foreign object appearing on the conveyor belt can be identified. The experimental findings indicate that a conveyor belt foreign object detection system based on an ARM processor and an Android operating system is capable of detecting foreign objects on conveyor belts with an average detection accuracy of 94.3%, a detection speed of 30 frames per second. The application of this method in the detection of foreign objects in conveyor belt can solve the shortcomings of existing methods. At the same time meet the requirements of the conveyor belt foreign object detection site environment.},

  abstract={In this paper, we propose a robotic cognitive system which can learn itself to do a specific assignment by accumulating experiences through bottom-up thinking to make decision by itself via top-down thinking according to the experiences. That is, the cognitive system has a self-learning ability which can accumulate its experiences to make itself smarter. In essence, the cognitive system possesses a perception model, a memory model, and a hypothesis model. The perception model converts image information into perception codes. The memory model stores experiences in the past and present to provide to the perception model and the hypothesis model. The hypothesis model, which generates the next decision according to the experiences from the memory model, is the most important part of the proposed cognitive system. To validate the performance of the proposed system, we utilize Chinese calligraphy writing tasks by a virtual robot through simulation to evaluate the abilities of the cognitive system. In order to generate the coordinates of the writing brush, we made the virtual robot practice to learn Chinese calligraphy through bottom-up thinking to construct the writing patterns. The illustrative examples in this paper show that the virtual robot can learn to write Chinese calligraphy by top-down thinking according to its own experiences.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present a proposal for a series of STEAM activities developing students’ computational thinking, improving their health literacy, and consequently taking care of their own well-being. The implementation of these activities in the classroom requires not only the knowledge and skills of informatics and biology, but also the collaboration of teachers of both subjects. These activities are implemented in phases, starting in biology lesson and continuing in informatics lesson. The first activity tests the level of sensitivity of people to colour differences. The second activity trains human adaptation to psychological stress. The third activity is focused on creation of compensatory aid that compensates for colour perception disorder. The design and programming of students’ STEAM applications is a meaningful way to use informatics in problem solving. Using and experimenting with these applications helps students to better understand the biological content. STEAM approach strengthens students’ orientation towards interdisciplinary studies (e.g. bioinformatics) at the higher education level and helps them to be more employable in the labour market.},

  abstract={Writing or sketching on whiteboards is an essential part of collaborative discussions in business meetings, reading groups, design sessions, and interviews. However, prior work in collaborative virtual reality (VR) systems has rarely explored the design space of multi-user layouts and interaction modes with virtual whiteboards. In this paper, we present CollaboVR, a reconfigurable framework for both co-located and geographically dispersed multi-user communication in VR. Our system unleashes users’ creativity by sharing freehand drawings, converting 2D sketches into 3D models, and generating procedural animations in real-time. To minimize the computational expense for VR clients, we leverage a cloud architecture in which the computational expensive application (Chalktalk) is hosted directly on the servers, with results being simultaneously streamed to clients. We have explored three custom layouts – integrated, mirrored, and projective – to reduce visual clutter, increase eye contact, or adapt different use cases. To evaluate CollaboVR, we conducted a within-subject user study with 12 participants. Our findings reveal that users appreciate the custom configurations and real-time interactions provided by CollaboVR. We have open sourced CollaboVR at https://github.com/snowymo/CollaboVR to facilitate future research and development of natural user interfaces and real-time collaborative systems in virtual and augmented reality.},

The goal is to create melodious alapana sequences that follow a given input Raga, ensuring continuity and coherence throughout the generated musical piece. The proposed approach incorporates Carnatic music theory rules into the generation process to enhance the structural coherence of the generated alapana. Additionally, various hyperparameter settings were explored to achieve the best performance. The Fréchet Audio Distance, Percentage of Correct Pitches and the Subjective evaluation through human listeners are the evaluation metrics of this approach. The result of this study demonstrates the potential of using GANs and FSM for generating continuous and pleasing alapana sequences in Carnatic music, contributing to the growing body of research in computational music generation.},

  abstract={Modern companies are moving rapidly toward more customer-oriented approaches for new product design and development. In real-world applications, customer requirements are more diverse and rather heterogeneous in practice, which requires the targeted market to be multisegmented. In this article, employing the quality function deployment (QFD) and assuming that parameter uncertainty exists, we propose a new fuzzy QFD model for use in multisegment markets, to search for optimal engineering characteristics by maximizing the overall customer satisfaction score. Under that framework, and when the credibility measure is employed, we adopt a fuzzy chance-constrained programming setting to convert the fuzzy model into its crisp counterpart. Afterwards, an analytical method based on fuzzy operational law is proposed to further transform the chance-constrained programming into an equivalent explicit model that can be solved directly by a standard commercial software. For a targeted group of customers, a new yoghurt design is presented to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of our treatment. We report that our methodology not only permits the selection of the preferred solution based on an acceptable level of risk, which is very important in practice, but also guarantees higher customer satisfaction scores. This fact extends the fuzzy QFD methodology to a wider range of applications.},

  abstract={Cholecystitis is a common disease with a high incidence, and attracts much attention. It not only harms human health, but also affects quality of work and life. Therefore, the choice of a suitable treatment is badly important for patients. In this paper, a novel selection model of treatments for cholecystitis based on hybrid multiple-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM), which is helpful to choose the most suitable treatment in the case of asymmetric information between doctors and patients. Subsequently, subjective and objective criteria are comprehensively taken into account in the index system of the selection model for cholecystitis, and combines 2-tuple linguistic with quantitative data analysis. Besides, the evaluation information obtained from the patient's conditions, the treatment and the hospital's medical status, etc., including real numbers, interval numbers, and linguistic labels with multi-granularity, is more complete and real. And the 2-tuple linguistic model is used to unify the non-homogeneous information, so the treatment selection is accurate and reliable. Simultaneously, for the unknown index and criteria weight, the improved entropy weight method and the BWM (best-worst-method) are utilized to figure out the index weight and criteria weight, respectively. Further, TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for interactive and multi-criteria decision-making model) method based on the prospect theory is applied to solve the prioritization of cholecystitis treatments, and give full consideration to the decision maker of risk aversion. Eventually, an empirical study of treatment selection for cholecystitis is conducted. Sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis indicate that the proposed selection model of treatments for cholecystitis patients is reliable and effective.},

This platform is designed to empower intelligence analysts by improving the integration of people, algorithms, software, tools, and manual work in the production of time-pressured intelligence assessments. Combining the perspectives of the ACS computer science design team and an embedded social scientist, this paper will use ACS to discuss the “platformization” of intelligence analysis and what this means for how we might think about and plan for reflexive design in future computational intelligence analytic systems.},

  abstract={With the advent in advanced computing methodologies and forward-thinking data storage needs over the last decade, there has been a major drive for reformatting archival collections to enable advanced computational analysis. In this paper, we present our digital compendium of music from the Arab Mashriq and Western Indian Ocean comprising two music collections drawn from Library materials and field recordings at the New York University Abu Dhabi. This is at once the product and object of our ongoing research at the intersection of cultural heritage preservation and computational analysis. Through computational-ethnomusicological research, we explore the cross-cultural similarities, interactions, and patterns from the music excerpts in order to understand their similarity space by employing audio analysis, machine learning, and visualization techniques. Besides the digital artifactual value, pedagogical/educational and scholarly outcomes, we focus on attracting user-friendly and community engagement into appreciating the music from this region. This is done by providing interactive visualizations of the musical features on a dashboard application and 3-D rendering of the mappings in a VR environment. The VR experience is not only immersive but also provides a scope for appreciation, learning, and dissemination of the music from the region.},

  abstract={Cloud computing is one of today's most exciting technology because of its cost-reducing, flexibility, and scalability. With the fast growing of cloud computing technology, Data security becomes more and more important in it. In evaluating whether to move to cloud computing, it is important to compare benefits and also risks of it. Thus, security and other existed issues in the cloud cause cloud clients need more time to think about moving to cloud environments. But Security-related topics is one of the most arguable issues in the cloud computing which caused several enterprises looks to this technology uncertainly and move toward it warily. In this paper I try to summarize cloud computing RAS (Reliability, Availability, and Security) issues and also clarify available solution for some of them. In this paper I try to summarize virtualization level of cloud computing security in detailed view.},

  year={1999},
  volume={},

  pages={163-166},
  abstract={The simultaneous switch noise (SSN) problem has traditionally been thought of as an inductance problem. When many drivers on a Si chip switch at the same time, current crowds into the chip ground or V/sub dd/ inductance. Ground bounce occurs proportional to the inductance in the ground or V/sub dd/ lead and the rate of change of current. This line of thinking has been effective at solving SSN problems for lead frame packages. However, packaging has progressed to packages with power and ground planes. Package traces behave more like transmission lines with impedance and delay rather than lumped inductors. The signal waveform rise and fall times are so fast that an edge may fit within the package. Wire bonds have been replaced by solder bumps and peripheral leads have been replaced by solder balls. The new structures may have less than 1% of the inductance of the packages in use just a few years ago. Capacitive and resistive elements have been added to inductance matrices to account for the package time delay and losses, but the number of circuit elements in an SSN analysis and the increased number of simultaneously switching drivers have resulted in large, complex simulation runs that require much CPU time and computer resources. It has become harder to find meaningful model to hardware correlation for large SSN problems. It is time to consider a radically new approach to simulating the SSN problem. This paper looks at treatment of the SSN problem as a power plane bounce problem.},
