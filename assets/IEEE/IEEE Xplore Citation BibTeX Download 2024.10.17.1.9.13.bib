  abstract={Heuristics are widely used for solving computational intractable synthesis problems. However, until now, there has been limited effort to systematically develop heuristics that can be applied to a variety of synthesis tasks. We focus on development of general optimization principles so that they can be applied to a wide range of synthesis problems. In particular, we propose a new way to realize the most constraining principle where at each step we gradually relax the constraints on the most constrained elements of the solution. This basic optimization mechanism is augmented with several new heuristic principles: minimal freedom reduction, negative thinking, calibration, simultaneous step consideration, and probabilistic modeling. We have successfully applied these optimization principles to a number of common behavioral synthesis tasks. Specifically, we demonstrate a systematic way to develop optimization algorithms for maximum independent set, time-constrained scheduling, and soft real-time system scheduling. The effectiveness of the approach and algorithms is validated on extensive real-life benchmarks.},

  title={Repeated Builds During Code Review: An Empirical Study of the OpenStack Community}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={153-165},
  abstract={Code review is a popular practice where developers critique each others' changes. Since automated builds can identify low-level issues (e.g., syntactic errors, regression bugs), it is not uncommon for software organizations to incorporate automated builds in the code review process. In such code review deployment scenarios, submitted change sets must be approved for integration by both peer code reviewers and automated build bots. Since automated builds may produce an unreliable signal of the status of a change set (e.g., due to “flaky” or non-deterministic execution behaviour), code review tools, such as Gerrit, allow developers to request a “recheck”, which repeats the build process without updating the change set. We conjecture that an unconstrained recheck command will waste time and resources if it is not applied judiciously. To explore how the recheck command is applied in a practical setting, in this paper, we conduct an empirical study of 66,932 code reviews from the OpenStack community. We quantitatively analyze (i) how often build failures are rechecked; (ii) the extent to which invoking recheck changes build failure outcomes; and (iii) how much waste is generated by invoking recheck. We observe that (i) 55% of code reviews invoke the recheck command after a failing build is reported; (ii) invoking the recheck command only changes the outcome of a failing build in 42% of the cases; and (iii) invoking the recheck command increases review waiting time by an average of 2,200% and equates to 187.4 compute years of waste-enough compute resources to compete with the oldest land living animal on earth. Our observations indicate that the recheck command is frequently used after the builds fail, but does not achieve a high likelihood of build success. Based on a developer survey and our history-based quantitative findings, we encourage reviewer teams to think twice before rechecking and be considerate of waste. While recheck currently generates plenty of wasted computational resources and bloats waiting times, it also presents exciting future opportunities for researchers and tool builders to propose solutions that can reduce waste.},

  abstract={The emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the way people think about computational intelligence in real-life applications. It brought to life concepts such as smart cities, which could not have been realized using classic computing technologies. While domains like health, manufacturing, and agriculture have gained greatly from the introduction of internet-connected, low-cost smart monitoring and control devices, the energy sector remains the most significant application of IoT technologies. The most recent works on smart energy systems focus on the integration of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. While renewable energy has been a key topic of research for decades, its adoption at large scale has been hindered by reliability and intermittency issues. Internet of Things can provide solutions to overcome such issues and enable grid integration by providing means for remote and real-time monitoring and performance analysis of solar facilities. This paper presents smart solar energy systems as an IoT application and derives primary system requirements of IoT middleware required for building efficient, scalable, and reliable grid-integrated large-scale and distributed smart solar farms.},

  abstract={Making neuro-inspired structures more resistant to common difficulties is the focus of this study. AI and deep learning are crucial in many fields; therefore, neural networks must be reliable and durable. This post proposes a robust framework using 10 advanced tactics for a new and complete robustness approach. Our technique uses dropout, gradient masking, transfer learning, adversarial training, randomized smoothing, input preparation, strong activation functions, ensemble learning, Bayesian neural networks, and gradient masking. These strategies are aimed at addressing hostile assaults, noise, and environmental changes. Combining these approaches makes the system more versatile, making it ideal for self-driving vehicles, medical diagnostics, and hacking. We conducted comprehensive research to evaluate the proposed method’s accuracy, durability, resistance, generalization, computational cost, and real-world usage. Line charts illustrate the method’s strengths and weaknesses. These numbers demonstrate how the proposed approach differs from previous ones. They demonstrate its versatility and efficacy. Finally, our results demonstrate a reliable, versatile, and proven method for neural network resilience. Our method handles common modifications using sophisticated methods. This yields a forward-thinking, effective solution to AI environmental changes. The reliability of neuro-inspired systems has improved, which will affect artificial intelligence.},

  abstract={In 1982, geodemographics was “the new magic.” The system promised to pinpoint voters. One of its key developers, Jonathan Robbin, boasted, “Tell me someone's zip code, and I can predict what they eat, drink, drive—even think.” What was the secret? Robbin and his company, the Claritas Corporation, were among the first to merge newly digitized census data and computational social science into a geodemographic system called PRIZM. It produced new categories of populations known as clusters. These clusters provided a novel and legible form of computer demographics for marketers reliant on direct mail. Drawing on interviews and historical research, this article chronicles the understudied history of the Claritas Corporation. At a time of growing distress about microtargeting and behavioral advertising, the Claritas Corporation is a critical case to understand how computing changed how marketers and politicians distinguished, described, and marketed to Americans.},

  abstract={IoT devices have changed into one of the mainstays in areas like houses, industry and education, resulting in a level of convenience and efficiency that has never been achieved before. Even though the most important advantage of the distributed network is raising the level of security, the problem of security vulnerabilities with the extended networks remains. This paper is devoted to a novel strategy of Federated Learning (FL) that could become an applied solution for enhancing the safety of the IoT. Therefore, based on its decentralized knowledge process, FL allows IoT devices to cooperate in achieving common purposes without endangering data pri vacy. The paper uses this thinking method to deal with scalability, model personalization, and non-IID data that aren’t IID distributing, suggesting solutions through model aggregation techniques or Artificial Intelligence (AI). Experimental evidence highlights that FL is very useful in enhancing IoT security irrespective of the diversity of its applications. To this end, residents of smart homes experienced a 17% increase in detecting the anomalies through the setting up of FL. This situation was replicated in the industrial Internet of Things, where the false positive rates were reduced from 20% to 5%, thus improving the system’s efficiency. Furthermore, in the FL context in healthcare IoT ecosystems, this blazes a trail for privacy-preserving data analytics, preserving patient confidentiality and systematic profiling of noteworthy health trends. These findings thus demonstrate that FL is a feasible way of dealing with the security challenges of IoT scalable, promptly and in a manner that maintains user privacy. The article takes part in a conversation about ways to strengthen the security of IoT networks. Such a framework is based on the computational power of IoT devices. It allows us to detect and prevent threats in time. Nonetheless, it urges extensive R&D attempts to be introduced to develop better security solutions in IoT. Without the involvement of different technologies, it won’t be easy to ensure safety and create some reliable IoT ecosystems.},

  title={Simultaneous Active Learning of Classifiers & Attributes via Relative Feedback}, 
  year={2013},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={644-651},
  abstract={Active learning provides useful tools to reduce annotation costs without compromising classifier performance. However it traditionally views the supervisor simply as a labeling machine. Recently a new interactive learning paradigm was introduced that allows the supervisor to additionally convey useful domain knowledge using attributes. The learner first conveys its belief about an actively chosen image e.g. "I think this is a forest, what do you think?". If the learner is wrong, the supervisor provides an explanation e.g. "No, this is too open to be a forest". With access to a pre-trained set of relative attribute predictors, the learner fetches all unlabeled images more open than the query image, and uses them as negative examples of forests to update its classifier. This rich human-machine communication leads to better classification performance. In this work, we propose three improvements over this set-up. First, we incorporate a weighting scheme that instead of making a hard decision reasons about the likelihood of an image being a negative example. Second, we do away with pre-trained attributes and instead learn the attribute models on the fly, alleviating overhead and restrictions of a pre-determined attribute vocabulary. Finally, we propose an active learning framework that accounts for not just the label-but also the attributes-based feedback while selecting the next query image. We demonstrate significant improvement in classification accuracy on faces and shoes. We also collect and make available the largest relative attributes dataset containing 29 attributes of faces from 60 categories.},

  abstract={Wearable activity tracking devices associated with the Quantified Self movement have potential benefit for educational settings because they produce authentic and granular data about activities and experiences already familiar to youth. This article explores how that potential could be realized through explicit acknowledgment of and response to tacit design assumptions about how such technologies will be used in practice and strategic design for use in a classroom. We argue that particular practical adaptations that we have identified serve to ensure that the classroom and educational use cases are appropriately considered. As an example of how those adaptations are realized in actual elementary classrooms, we describe an effort to provide fifth-grade students each with their own Fitbit activity trackers in the context of a multi-week unit exploring core ideas in elementary statistics. Observational descriptions and transcript excerpts of students and teachers discussing their own Fitbit data are presented to illustrate what opportunities exist to leverage youth familiarity with daily activities in a way that targets development of statistical thinking. Quantitative written test results showing learning gains and differences between traditional and wearable device-enhanced instruction are also presented. Improvement on several statistical thinking constructs is identified, including in the areas of data display, conceptions of statistics, modeling variability, and informal inference.},

  abstract={The development of phonological awareness, i.e. the metacognitive skill that allows thinking and manipulating the language structure, from an early age is mandatory for the acquisition of literacy skills. Multisensory stimulation, curiosity and interest are fundamental for learning. In doing so, Communication Technologies have a key role because a learning-oriented use can encourage current digital natives&#x2019; interest and thinking. This paper presents a game with tangible technology designed for both intervention and diagnostic, formative and summative evaluation. The user experience was carried out during two weeks through a multiple case study with four kindergarten children. A multimedia adventure game was presented in which they had to solve phonological awareness challenges through the manipulation of tangible technology to achieve the final goal. The observation was recorded in the designed evaluation model, allowing the analysis of pre- and post-intervention data after the triangulation of data for subsequent qualitative analysis. The results show an improvement in phonological awareness, as well as the gamified experience marks. These promising outcomes support the use of such methodologies to a learner-centered education model.},

  abstract={Education is an essential aspect in building the social value and norm to produce individuals who can think in high order thinking through learning and teaching activities. As technology keeps growing, an online learning platform has emerged. This platform is called e-Learning. e-Learning allows teachers to save many questions into the e-Learning question bank. However, these questions need to be reviewed so the questions can be matched with the achievement of competence. One educational identification standard that is often to improve the quality of the questions is Bloom's Taxonomy. Bloom's Taxonomy was created in 1956 and revised in 2001. This study compares the performance of the Support Vector Machine and Na&#x00EF;ve Bayes algorithms to classify quiz questions based on the cognitive level of Revised Bloom's Taxonomy. In this study, the dataset received two treatments in handling the imbalanced class. One dataset is using SMOTE method, and one another is not using any oversampling methods. The result shows that classification with oversampling datasets had better results than those without oversampling. The Support Vector Machine algorithm with SMOTE has the highest accuracy of 98%, rather than the Na&#x00EF;ve Bayes algorithm with SMOTE has an accuracy of 91%.},

  abstract={Creativity is a central phenomenon in human life. World-famous scientists and artists are praised for their creative genius. Schools and universities seek to educate creativity in students and many employers want to hire creative personnel. However, the measurement of creativity is difficult up to the present day. Standard creativity tests typically require human expertise in the evaluation of test responses. This evaluation is often more time-intensive than taking the test itself. Moreover, creativity tests are still regularly conducted in a pen-and-paper format, rendering the data analysis all the more tedious. In this article, we propose a digital game for assessing creativity. It can be hosted online. The data analysis can be automated and conducted in real-time. The test is implemented as a tower defense game ("Immune Defense"). We submit that a video game constitutes a natural setting, as opposed to a formal testing scenario, and provides an opportunity to test real-life creativity. We use the game event data gathered during each round of the game to determine a player's creativity score. A study with 17 participants was performed to compare game-based creativity scores to scores obtained with a standard creativity test, the Alternative Uses Task. Our preliminary data validate the proposed approach.},

  abstract={A total of 34% of AI research and development projects fail or are abandoned, according to a recent survey by Rackspace Technology of 1,870 companies. In this perspective paper, a new STrategic ROadMap, aiSTROM, is presented that empowers managers to create an AI strategy. A comprehensive approach is provided that guides managers and lead developers through the various challenges in the implementation process. In the aiSTROM framework, the top  $n$  potential projects (typically 3-5) are first identified. For each of those, seven areas of focus are thoroughly analysed. These areas include creating a data strategy that takes into account unique cross-departmental machine learning data requirements, security, and legal requirements. aiSTROM then guides managers to think about how to put together an interdisciplinary artificial intelligence (AI) implementation team given the scarcity of AI talent. Once an AI team strategy has been established, it needs to be positioned within the organization, either cross-departmental or as a separate division. Other considerations include AI as a service (AIaas) and outsourcing development. Looking at new technologies, one has to consider challenges such as bias, the legality of black-box models, and keeping humans in the loop. Next, like any project, value-based key performance indicators (KPIs) need to be defined to track and validate the progress. Depending on the company’s risk strategy, a SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) can help further classify the shortlisted projects. Finally, one should make sure that the strategy includes continuous education of employees to enable a culture of adoption. This unique and comprehensive framework offers a practical tool for managers and lead developers.},

  pages={4270-4282},
  abstract={With the rapid development of autonomous driving technology, a variety of high-performance end-to-end driving models (E2EDMs) are being proposed. In order to understand the computational methods of E2EDMs, pixel-level explanations methods are used to obtain the explanations of the E2EDMs. However, little attention has been paid to the excellence of the explanations of E2EDMs. Therefore, in order to build trustworthy E2EDMs, we focus on improving the persuasibility of the explanations of E2EDMs. We propose an object-level explanation method (main approach) for E2EDMs, which masks the objects in the image and then treats the change in the prediction result as the importance of the objects, then we explain the E2EDM by the importance of each object. To further validate the effectiveness of object-level explanations, we propose another approach (validation approach), which trains E2EDMs with object information as input and generates the importance of objects using general explanation methods. Both approaches generate object-level explanations, in order to compare these object-level explanations with traditional pixel-level explanations, we propose experimental methods to measure the persuasibility of explanations of E2EDMs through a subjective and objective method. The subjective method evaluates persuasibility based on the extent to which participants think the importance of features indicated by the explanations is correct. The objective method evaluates the persuasibility based on the human annotation similarity between provided with only the important part of images and provided with the complete images. The experimental results show that the object-level explanations are more persuasive than the traditional pixel-level explanations.},

  abstract={Emotion is intrinsic to humans and consequently, emotion understanding is a key part of human-like artificial intelligence (AI). Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) is becoming increasingly popular as a new research frontier in natural language processing (NLP) due to its ability to mine opinions from the plethora of publicly available conversational data on platforms such as Facebook, Youtube, Reddit, Twitter, and others. Moreover, it has potential applications in health-care systems (as a tool for psychological analysis), education (understanding student frustration), and more. In Addition, ERC is also extremely important for generating emotion-aware dialogues that require an understanding of the user’s emotions. Catering to these needs calls for effective and scalable conversational emotion-recognition algorithms. However, it is a difficult problem to solve because of several research challenges. In this paper, we discuss these challenges and shed light on recent research in this field. We also describe the drawbacks of these approaches and discuss the reasons why they fail to successfully overcome the research challenges in ERC.},

  abstract={Exponential technological expansion creates opportunities for competitive advantage by applying new data-oriented approaches to digital marketing practices. Machine learning (ML) can predict future developments and support decision-making by extracting insights from large amounts of generated data. This functionality greatly impacts and streamlines the strategic decision-making process of organizations. The research gap analysis revealed that a little is known about marketers' attitude toward, and knowledge about, ML tools and their adoption and utilization to support strategic and operational management. The research presented here focuses on the selection and adoption of the ML-driven analytical tools by three distinct groups: marketing agencies, media companies, and advertisers. Qualitative and quantitative research was conducted on a sample of these organizations operating in Slovakia. The findings highlight: 1) the important role of intelligent analytical tools in the creation and deployment of marketing strategies; 2) the lack of knowledge about emerging technologies, such as ML and artificial intelligence (AI); 3) the potential application of the ML tools in marketing, and; 4) the low level of adoption and utilization of the ML-driven analytical tools in marketing management. A framework consisting of enablers and a process map was developed to help organizations identify the opportunities and successfully execute projects that are oriented toward the deployment and adoption of the analytical ML tools in digital marketing.},

  abstract={Detection of unintentional islanding, defined as inadvertently separation of distributed generators (DGs) from the utility grid, is a major challenging issue for modern distribution networks. Islanding detection becomes problematic especially when the local generation matches or closely matches the local load. Therefore, there are strict requirements for accurate, fast, and reliable islanding detection of renewables and DG-based systems. Various islanding schemes have been proposed in the literature, which can be categorized as remote, local, and intelligent-classifier-based schemes. Recently, intelligent schemes have gained attention due to their superior properties and advantages relative to traditional approaches. This paper overviews the shift in research from traditional schemes to intelligent islanding schemes. It also highlights the major obstacles, challenges, advantages and disadvantages, and future research directions of intelligent schemes. In this study, the intelligent-classifier-based islanding detection schemes presented over the last decade are analyzed objectively and comprehensively from all aspects of islanding detection.

  abstract={Stroke is one of the prime reasons for paralysis throughout the world caused due to impaired nervous system and resulting in disability to move the affected body parts. Rehabilitation is the natural remedy for recovering from paralysis and enhancing the quality of life. Brain Computer Interface (BCI) controlled assistive technology is the new paradigm, providing assistance and rehabilitation for the paralysed. But, most of these devices are error prone and also hard to get continuous control because of the dynamic nature of the brain signals. Moreover, existing devices like exoskeletons brings additional burden on the patient and the caregivers and also results in mental fatigue and frustration. To solve these issues Artificial Muscle Intelligence with Deep Learning (AMIDL) system is proposed in this paper. AMIDL integrates user intentions with artificial muscle movements in an efficient way to improve the performance. Human thoughts captured using Electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors are transformed into body movements, by utilising microcontroller and Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) device. EEG signals are subjected to pre-processing, feature extraction and classification, before being passed on to the affected body part. The received EEG signal is correlated with the recorded artificial muscle movements. If the captured EEG signal falls below the desired level, the affected body part will be stimulated by the recorded artificial muscle movements. The system also provides a feature for communicating human intentions as alert message to caregivers, in case of emergency situations. This is achieved by offline training of specific gesture and online gesture recognition algorithm. The recognised gesture is transformed into speech, thus enabling the paralysed to express their feelings to the relatives or friends. Experiments were carried out with the aid of healthy and paralysed subjects. The AMIDL system helped to reduce mental fatigue, miss-operation, frustration and provided continuous control. The thrust of lifting the exoskeleton is also reduced by using light weight wireless electrodes. The proposed system will be a great communication aid for paralysed to express their thoughts and feelings with dear and near ones, thereby enhancing the quality of life.},

  abstract={The interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy (IVPF) sets, describing the membership and non-membership degrees from interval values, can address uncertain information, while the normal fuzzy number (NFN) can depict normal distribution information in anthropogenic activity and natural environment. By combining the advantages of both operations, in this study, we proposed the interval-valued Pythagorean normal fuzzy (IVPNF) sets by introducing the NFN into IVPF environment. Firstly, we defined the conception, the operational laws, score function, accuracy function of IVPNF sets. Secondly, we presented four information aggregation operators to aggregate IVPNF information, including the IVPNF weighted averaging (IVPNFWA) operator, IVPNF weighted geometric (IVPNFWG) operator, the generalized IVPNFWA operator, and the generalized IVPNFWG operator. In addition, we analyzed some desirable properties of monotonicity, commutativity, and idempotency for the proposed four operators. Finally, a numerical example on multi-attribute decision-making problem is given to verify the practicality of the proposed operators, and the comparative and sensitive analysis are used to show the effectiveness and flexibility of our proposed approach.},

  title={Analyzing Tongue Images Using a Conceptual Alignment Deep Autoencoder}, 
  year={2018},
  volume={6},

  pages={5962-5972},
  abstract={Artificial intelligence can learn some concepts by analyzing sensory data similarly to humans. This paper explores how artificial neural networks (ANNs) can learn abstract concepts by analyzing tongue images based on concepts from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which is a discipline that relies heavily on practitioner experience. A computer-aided method will be investigated that analyzes sensory data for TCM practitioners. This paper proposes capitalizing on deep learning techniques. A method called the conceptual alignment deep auto-encoder (CADAE) is proposed to analyze tongue images that represent different body constitution (BC) types, which are the underlying concepts in TCM. In the first step, CADAE encodes the images to a representation space; in the second step, it decodes the patterns. The experiments demonstrate that CADAE can learn effective representations of abstract concepts aligned with BC types by encoding the tongue images. Furthermore, the representation space of the hidden conceptual neurons can be visualized by a decoder network. The experiments also demonstrate that ANNs acquire different data perspectives when different loss functions are used for training. Numerous representation spaces of ANNs remain to be explored. To some extent, our exploration demonstrates that artificial intelligence (AI) has the ability to learn some concepts in a manner similarly to human beings. Based on this ability, AI shows promise in helping humans form new effective concepts that can facilitate medical development and alleviate the burdens of medical practitioners.},

  abstract={In this paper, a brief survey of data preprocessing methods is presented. Specifically, the data preprocessing methods used in the smart grid (SG) domain are surveyed. Also, with the advent of SG, data collection on a large scale became possible. The data is essential for electricity demand, generation and price forecasting, which plays an important role in making energy efficient decisions, and long and short term predictions regarding energy generation, consumption and storage. However, the forecasting accuracy decreases when data is used in raw form. Hence, data preprocessing is considered essential. This paper provides an overview of the data preprocessing methods and a detailed discussion of the methods used in the existing literature. A comparison of the methods is also given. A survey of closely related survey papers is also presented and the papers are compared based on their contributions. Moreover, based on the discussion of the data preprocessing methods, a narrative is built with a critical analysis. Finally, future research directions are discussed to guide the readers.},

  title={A Critical Review on Selected Fuzzy Min-Max Neural Networks and Their Significance and Challenges in Pattern Classification}, 
  year={2019},
  volume={7},
  number={},
  pages={56129-56146},
  abstract={At present, pattern classification is one of the most important aspects of establishing machine intelligence systems for tackling decision-making processes. The fuzzy min-max (FMM) neural network combines the operations of an artificial neural network and fuzzy set theory into a common framework. FMM is considered one of the most useful neural networks for pattern classification. This paper aims to 1) analyze the FMM neural network in terms of its impact in addressing pattern classification problems; 2) examine models that are proposed based on the original FMM model (i.e., existing FMM-based variants); 3) identify the challenges associated with FMM and its variants, and; 4) discuss future trends and make recommendations for improvement. The review is conducted based on a methodical protocol. Through a rigorous searching and filtering process, the relevant studies are extracted and comprehensively analyzed to adequately address the defined research questions. The findings indicate that FMM plays a critical role in providing solutions to pattern classification issues. The FMM model and a number of FMM-based variants are identified and systematically analyzed with respect to their aims, improvements introduced and results achieved. In addition, FMM and its variants are critically analyzed with respect to their benefits and limitations. This paper shows that the existing FMM-based variants still encounter issues in terms of the learning process (expansion, overlap test, and contraction), which influence the classification performance. Based on the review findings, research opportunities are suggested to propose a new model to enhance the number of existing FMM models, particularly in terms of their learning process by minimizing hyperbox overlap pertaining to different classes as well as avoiding membership ambiguity of the overlapped region. In short, this review provides a comprehensive and critical reference for researchers and practitioners to leverage FMM and its variants for undertaking pattern classification tasks.},

  pages={190710-190721},
  abstract={The designers' tendency to adhere to a specific mental set and heavy emotional investment in their initial ideas often limit their ability to innovate during the design ideation process. The shrinking time-to-market and the growing diversity of users' needs further exacerbate this gap. Recent advances in deep generative models have created new possibilities to overcome the cognitive obstacles of designers through automated generation or editing of design concepts. This article explores the capabilities of generative adversarial networks (GAN) for automated, attribute-aware generative design of the visual attributes of a product. Specifically, a design attribute GAN (DA-GAN) model is developed for automated generation of fashion product images with the desired visual attributes. Experiments on a large fashion dataset signify the potentials of GAN for attribute-aware generative design, verify the ability of editing attributes with relatively higher accuracy and uncover several key challenges and research questions for future work.},

  volume={8},

  pages={179295-179306},
  abstract={In this paper, a reinforcement learning algorithm is applied for the first time to find a ferromagnetic core structure with optimal coupling coefficient between transmitting (Tx) and receiving (Rx) coils of a wireless power transfer (WPT) system. Since formula-based theoretical design is not available due to the non-linear magnetic field distortion stems from the presence of the ferromagnetic core in a WPT system, the proposed design has been achieved through finite element analysis (FEA) simulation-based data learning. The proposed design methods are so general that they can be applied to any conventional WPT coil types. We applied the proposed algorithm to the ferromagnetic core structure design of a simple dipole coil first. By training only 2.3 % data out of total possible cases, it is experimentally verified that the core structure obtained by the proposed method has a coupling coefficient 7 % higher than that of the example design level in the case of 98 cm distance between Tx and Rx coils.},

  title={Tooee: A Novel Scratch Extension for K-12 Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Education Using Text-Based Visual Blocks}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={9},
  number={},
  pages={149630-149646},
  abstract={Many approaches have been proposed to teach the basic concepts of big data and artificial intelligence to K-12 students based on block-based programming languages, such as Scratch. Using these approaches, young students can easily experience big data and artificial intelligence through a drag-and-drop approach. However, it remains difficult for them to perform more complex tasks, such as directly collecting data from the web or exploiting custom-made machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel Scratch extension that allows Scratch to communicate with text-based programming languages such as Python and JavaScript using WebSockets. Unlike other Scratch extensions, our extension greatly enhances the extensibility of Scratch given its use of “text-based visual blocks” so that messages can be freely exchanged through a minimum number of blocks. In order for students to use these blocks easily, the blocks are designed such that they can be used as if talking with a friend named “Tooee.” In order to show how this extension can help students create big data and artificial intelligence programs, we present eight example applications that students can easily implement. These are (1) Weather Forecast, (2) Top 5 Movies in Theaters, (3) COVID-19 Dashboard, (4) Saving Quiz Results to a CSV File, (5) Facial Image Classification, (6) Color Classification, (7) Object Classification, and (8) Handwriting Recognition. Our analyses and experimental results show that Tooee has several advantages over other educational environments.},
