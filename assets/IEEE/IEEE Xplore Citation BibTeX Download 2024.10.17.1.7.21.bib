  abstract={Estimation of a object pose from camera is a well-developing topic in computer vision. In theory, the pose from a calibrated camera can be uniquely determined. But in practice, most of the real-time pose estimation algorithms suffer from pose ambiguity due to low accuracy of the target object. We think that pose ambiguity¡Xtwo distinct local minima of the according error function¡Xexist because of the phenomenon of geometric illusions. Both of the ambiguous poses are plausible. After obtaining the solution of two minima (pose candidates), we develop a real-time algorithm for stable pose estimation of a target objects with a motion model. In the experimental results, the proposed algorithm diminish the significance of pose jumping and pose jittering effectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to solve the pose ambiguity problem with motion model in real-time application.},

  pages={1452-1458},
  abstract={The functional aspect of the parts and assemblies is the engine that generates constructive solutions that satisfy customer requirements. When specifying design solutions, the designer always thinks in terms of function to be satisfied. However, this information is immediately lost once the design solution is validated. In this context this paper will first contribute to the enrichment of the “computer aided design, (CAD)” modeler database by integrating data related to product functions. Then, it will enrich the data related to assembly constraints by the fit aspect. It would be useful if the designer can specify, when creating an assembly constraint between a shaft and a hub (either through bearings, bushings or by direct contact), the type of constraint fit (tight, loose or uncertain). This information will be necessary, for example, when automatically generating assembly or disassembly drawings. The main objective of the proposed paper is the development of two applications. The first application named “computer aided design part function, (CAD PF)”, used for the enrichment of the parts database by the part function. The second one named “computer aided design adjustment constraint type, (CAD ACT)”, used for the enrichment of the database of assemblies by the type of constraint adjustment during their creation. These tools will be modeled by the graphical “system modeling language, (SysML)” and will be implemented using FreeCAD “Applications Programming Interfaces, (APIs)” which is an open source application.},

  abstract={We propose in this paper an original approach to the TV stream structuring problem. The goal of our work is to automatically break the TV stream into telecasts and advertisings and to label each telecast with its genre. One can think the TV stream structuring problem can be solved by an alignment of the program guide on the stream. But our study shows that, in average, only 25% of the telecasts per day are presented in the program guide. Hence, our method consists in improving statistically these program guides in order to reduce the TV stream structuring problem to a simple alignment problem. The improvement consists in adding the missing telecasts. We present an original system that lays on the modeling of past TV schedules by a contextual hidden Markov model and a regression tree. Interesting results are presented at the end of the paper},

  pages={195-200},
  abstract={The Ethernet becomes the fastest growing segment of industrial networking. Due to its high economic interest, at high speeds it will replace conventional fieldbus systems. Indeed, Industrial automation, Aircraft, Railway, Automotive and others domains, are increasingly being controlled via the Ethernet network. Its interest to be used in automotive field, in the powertrain and chassis domains, is growing day by day. Next-generation vehicles will be also controlled based on their interactions with the infrastructure as well as the environment. The cloud computing will be used to exchange real-time sensing and control information through vehicular wireless networks based on WiFi, WiGig and 5G networks. However, these networks are not developed for real-time vehicular control compliance. The use of Ethernet and wireless networks as a real-time control network for critical systems like powertrain and chassis vehicle domains is frequently questioned. Different solutions to modify them to meet real-time requirements have been proposed. This paper is interested to give more details concerning exactly this point. We will demonstrate that Ethernet and WiGig, when adducting the QoS priority policy and the duplication of the controllers in the end-points, can satisfy the real-time requirements when the throughput exceeds one Gbits/s that is, the modifications in each endpoint is quite simple to do. As many may think, the FlexRay network is mandatory for the powertrain and chassis modules and the Ethernet, the Wi-Fi, or its next generation, the WiGiG, can only support the body and multimedia domains. Its comparison with the Ethernet or the WiGiG proves that these latter networks are better when exceeding few gigabits per second for the four domains, with a minimum latency budget. We used the Network queuing theory to do these evaluations. We completed the classical four domains by two new domains, which are the advance driver assistance system and the V2X communications. These new domains are also connected via the full duplex Ethernet backbone, known as AFDX and μAFDX switching elements.},

  abstract={Wireless sensor nodes are deployed to gather useful information from the field but their constraint on battery power leads us to think about energy efficient routing protocols so that they can operate over longer periods of time. We study the advantages of having multiple chains in a network with each chain's topmost node (called the aggregator) collecting the data from the nodes beneath it and transmitting it to the sink. In the proposed scheme, a chain in each region works as PEGASIS. We also study how considering heterogeneity in the network can improve the lifetime of a network by a significant period. We assume that a fraction of the nodes in the network possess additional energy. We show by simulations that the introduction of heterogeneity into the network results in a greater lifetime, compared to those of the classical data aggregation schemes, with the duration increasing with the amount of additional energy considered.},

  year={2011},
  volume={},

  pages={216-220},
  abstract={50 years ago, Gilbert and Elliott introduced 2-state Markov channels to characterize bursty error processes in data transmission. The focus of this work is on the analysis of the effect of bit errors on higher layer blocks or packets. Starting from 2-state bit error channels in an extended Gilbert-Elliott format, packet errors again result in a 2-state process of the same type. The parameters of the packet error process are explicitly derived from those of the underlying bit error process. The solution for main performance measures is based on a superposition of two geometrical functions for the distributions of packet error bursts and gaps and the second order statistics. Knowledge about the solution for 2-state channels is implicitly present in solutions for N-state Markov models by Turin et al, but which require a more complex factorization approach. The latter involves root finding algorithms for eigenvalues and eigenvectors and NxN linear boundary equations, going far beyond what is needed for a 2-state analysis. Conversely, analysis of Markov processes is excluded in other work on packet error evaluation due to the lack of simple solutions. Therefore the authors think it worthwhile to summarize the simple approach for popular 2-state channels.},

  abstract={There are many examples of cases where access to improved models of human behavior and cognition has allowed the creation of robots that can better interact with humans, and not least in road vehicle automation, this is a rapidly growing area of research. Human–robot interaction (HRI) therefore provides an important applied setting for human behavior modeling—but given the vast complexity of human behavior, how complete and accurate do these models need to be? Here, we outline some possible ways of thinking about this problem, starting from the suggestion that modelers need to keep the right end goal in sight: a successful HRI, in terms of safety, performance, and human satisfaction. Efforts toward model completeness and accuracy should be focused on those aspects of human behavior to which interaction success is most sensitive.},

  abstract={The Work-in-progress paper discusses the faculty development model. The workplace problems for engineers in the 21st century demands interdisciplinary skills. To cater to the need, the educators need to make interventions for inculcating interdisciplinary skills among students. The challenge is that very limited focus is on preparing the faculty towards building interdisciplinary knowledge, skills and mentoring capabilities. The authors through this paper share an experience of deploying a faculty training model used for training the faculty towards mentoring interdisciplinary projects. The presented faculty development model is a result of the heuristic experience of four iterations and is organically evolved. The model was implemented in the context of a first-year engineering course titled Engineering Exploration. The course uses PBL pedagogy and every faculty, mentors a set of students to complete an interdisciplinary project. The nature of the projects in the course demands knowledge and skills from different domains to be applied at the mentioned stages. To mentor such interdisciplinary projects, faculty needs to be formally trained. However, in the literature authors found very limited architecture in the direction of standard frameworks and models that can be used to train the faculty towards interdisciplinary thinking and mentoring. The paper describes the evolved faculty training model consisting of four following phases where initial phases are focused on improving the technical skills among faculty members while the latter phase is focused on improving the mentoring skills.},

  abstract={In computer’s world these days cloud computing plays very important role. It gives user facilities like group of things such as software, platform and infrastructure services. Virtualization is the backbone of cloud resource sharing. Security is also a main problem of cloud. Multiple users have their own perception related to the cloud. By using cloud computing, user can access resources anywhere by using internet. So this technique is very useful in user’s daily life. One of the factors for cloud computing is cloud services which were provided by the cloud (IAAS, PAAS, and SAAS). These services enable users to access infrastructure, platform and software. Even resources are allocated to users according to their requirements. But many people think it is unsafe to use cloud resources and its services. It is unsafe to use cloud because there is no guarantee of information which is controlled or maintained by the vendors. There are some security issues that are noticed in cloud computing. In this paper, we have discussed a few issues with cloud computing and the challenges of cloud computing. This paper gives overall investigation of security on data, protection and issues in the cloud. The paper also defines the literature review related to the cloud computing issues and threats and also the various security concerns are discussed.},

The project incorporates aspects of electrical engineering and computing skills. This study is dedicated to the learning process to help students to deal with the complexity of an electric power network. This study has conducted a new methodology in educational research by adopting technology for teaching and learning. PBL, as an instructional strategy of active learning, was used and adapted for use in Analysis in Electrical Power Systems programme. This methodology addresses many of the concerns of teachers and professional organizations. Above all, it encourages students to be in charge of their education. It emphasizes critical thinking skills, understanding, learning how to learn, and working cooperatively with others. The benefits of PBL in the Electrical Power Systems course are seen in the way students improved the study and analysis of the security in an electrical power system. This method can also be seen as a benefit for Electric Power Systems where educators strive for improved teaching and learning.},

  abstract={Word representation learned from the analysis of natural language does not usually reflect the true semantics of words. The paper proposes a new method, named Visually Supervised Word2Vec (VS-Word2Vec) model to achieve the representation of the relation words that are important in knowledge related tasks. Our method first computes the visual feature vector of relation words based on deep networks, and then achieve the visual similarity matrix for all relation words, which we think reflects their true semantics. VS-Word2Vec model then combines the visual similarity and the CBOW and builds an optimization problem to jointly learn the word vector representation. Therefore, VS-Word2Vec fuses the visual modality and natural language together. Experiments implemented over the public datasets demonstrate that VS-Word2Vec model really changes the distribution of word representation and achieves more effective results in describing their true semantics than CBOW model.},

  abstract={During the early design explorations, designers and architects tend to treat freehand sketching as a mirror of their mind. The spontaneity of conventional sketching is undoubtedly important for the designer's thinking process. CAD systems and the contrived interfaces do not offer the advantage that sketching does. Can modern technology offer a tool that the designers would readily accept for their creative explorations? The study is based on a visualization of a hypothetical system, where the designer develops a representation of 3D shapes of reasonable complexity, sitting in front of a terminal. Using his gestures and limited speech, he inputs into the computer an online representation of shape. This feedback is available to the designer live on his monitor. The experiments reported test this hypothetical system using simulation. Gestures involve spatial movements and they could be more convenient tools for the designers to express spatial ideas. Keeping modeling of shapes in the computer during the act of design as a focus of this study, this paper aims to identify the potentials and limitations of the natural gestures as a source of shape information.},

  abstract={A simulation & implementation of a shortest path from the source to the destination in the amidst of obstacles using configuration space approach both with translations & rotations is presented in this paper.  One of the most important problems in robotics is the task-planning problem. A task is a job or an application or an operation that has to be done by the robot, whether it is a stationary robot or a mobile robot. The word ‘planning’ means deciding on a course of action before acting. Before a robot does a particular task, how the task has to be done or performed in its workspace has to be planned. This is what is called as Robot Task Planning (RTP). A plan is a representation of a course of action for achieving the goal. How the problem has to be solved has to be planned properly. Robot task planning is also called as problem solving techniques and is one of the important topics of Artificial Intelligence. For eg., when a problem is given to a human being to be solved; first, he or she thinks about how to solve the problem, then devises a strategy / plan how to tackle the problem. Then only he or she starts solving the problem.  Hence, robot task planning is also called as robot problem solving techniques.  Many of the items in task planning are currently under active research in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Image Processing and Robotics. Lot of research is going on in the robot problem solving techniques. The simulation & the experimental results show the effectives of the method used.},

  abstract={A form of artificial intelligence (AI) that is advanced and involves rules that are applied to data to simulate a person's thought process in a particular area, knowledge engineering can be described as an advanced form of artificial intelligence (AI). Knowledge engineering had evolved from its original form when it focused on transferring and analyzing knowledge from human problem-solvers into computer programs that could do the same. .It is essential to realize that transfer processing has limitations because humans make decisions differently than machines do. Non-linear thinking and analogous reasoning, often not logical, have not been considered in this case.It is becoming increasingly common today to use a modeling process for knowledge engineering, which creates a system that can reach the same conclusions as experts without following the same path or acquiring the same information from the same sources. In this paper, we aim to represent Knowledge engineering to transform knowledge into software that makes decisions similar to those made by human experts, such as financial advisors, whose decisions are based on their learning.Eventually, it is expected that human experts will be replaced by knowledge engineering in decision support software},

  abstract={For web services, QoS (Quality of Service, quality of service) is an important indicator for judging whether a web service is efficient. How to better predict the QoS value of the service to make appropriate service recommendations is the entire recommendation system and Issues that are being discussed in the service forecasting academia. At the same time, the timeliness and time relevance of QoS values are also affecting the prediction accuracy of Web services. A large amount of QoS data has potentially time-related attributes. This provides a new inspiration and thinking for service forecasting. Add the time characteristics of the data to the learning of the predictive model. Inspired by these factors, this paper proposes a deep neural network combination model that is sensitive to the time characteristics of QoS. At the same time, based on the final experimental results, the model proposed in this paper has obvious effects on the prediction of QoS values with time attributes.},

  abstract={In recent years, computer scientists have recognized the office as a natural environment for the application of computing technology. At the same time, there has been a growing awareness of the need for automated tools to increase the productivity of white-collar workers. In an ideal office environment, machines would assume all the repetitive, mechanical tasks, thus freeing people to concentrate on problems that require creative thinking. The key to providing these office tools is the representation and utilization of information about the business of the office. This special issue of Computer focuses on recent office information systems research that is directed at improving the environment and productivity of office workers.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence, as the main driving force of the new scientific and technological revolution, will inevitably bring some threat to the future in the process of upgrading and transformation, but more importantly, the new development opportunities. Ideological and political work has always been the “lifeline” of the work of the Party and the state, and will usher in unprecedented development opportunities in the era of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence as an information technology can enable ideological and political education in colleges and universities, one is to expand in time, space and situation, that is, to increase free time, expand space, and create a scene of localization to eliminate the dual opposition between the subject and object of ideological and political education and highlight its Noumenon; the other is to create a personalized education with meticulous, accurate and exquisite characteristics; and the third is to use “bit,” man-machine integration”, “Cognitive Outsourcing” realizes the co-construction, co-governance and sharing of ideological and political education resources in colleges and universities; fourth, using big data thinking, deep learning concept and machine learning. The principle of “black box” explores new laws, new ideas and new models of ideological and political education theory.},

  abstract={In this paper, a collaborative creation environment for learning activities in a classroom is proposed. It becomes more and more important to think on how learners can collaboratively learn in a classroom, as personal computers are introduced to schools. This learning environment incorporates a typical setting of personal computer classrooms and enables learners to create their own project on their personal computer and share it with others by publishing it to a shared computer. The Squeak eToy tile programming feature is adopted to make scripts for a project and a sharing mechanism of the project is built on the 3D peer-to-peer collaboration environment. Some project examples for this environment are also presented.},
