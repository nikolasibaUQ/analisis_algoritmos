  abstract={In the present era, mobile learning has secured a better position in modern technology base learning paradigms. It surpasses other conventional learning methods because of ubiquity, mobility, attractive content, facilitated connectivity, and institutional engagements. The main objective of this study is to identify how mobile learning content, higher education institute, and communication technology factors influence learners and teachers when using sustainable mobile learning in higher education. Through the literature review, we developed three separate impact models i.e. mobile learning content, higher education institute, and communication technology with separate impact factors. We used pre and post usage survey questionnaires of 60 teachers and 60 learners to evaluate these models. Primarily, they were asked to fill the pre-usage questionnaire with their initial mobile learning experience. Then, they were allowed to use the modified Moodle mobile app and asked to fill the post-usage questionnaire. The results reveal that the most significant influencing factors are, ease of use in mobile learning content, and facilitating conditions for higher education institutes and communication technology models. Finally, we can conclude that users prefer to have easy to use mobile learning content with better service facilities in higher education institutes and communication technologies.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Unlike traditional computing, soft computing solves difficult real-world problems and works with approximation models. Soft computing is more forgiving of approximations, ambiguity, partial truth, and imprecision than hard computing. The human mind is, in a sense, the ideal model for soft computing. Techniques like fuzzy logic, machine learning, genetic algorithms, expert systems, and artificial neural networks are the foundation of soft computing. Even though soft computing theory and methods were initially presented in the 1980s, automatic control engineering currently uses them as a major area of research and study. Soft computing techniques are currently being successfully applied in a wide range of commercial, industrial, and household applications. Soft computing techniques and application areas are expected to grow further with the introduction of low-cost, outstanding-performance digital processing units and the falling cost of memory chips. The purpose of this paper is to discuss embracing uncertainties and approximation for intelligent problem-solving with the help of soft computing. First, the study has discussed various soft computing systems. Moreover, the concept of fuzzy logic has been illustrated along with a description of its applications. In terms of research methodology, this research paper has followed a qualitative research approach by gathering knowledge based on reviewing a wide range of different studies regarding the research topic. According to the findings of this research, as computer processing units get cheaper and more powerful, intelligent systems and soft computing techniques become more significant. Complex algorithms must be used by intelligent systems to make difficult judgments and select the optimal solution from a range of options.},

  abstract={Due to increasing product complexity, variance and stricter safety regulations there is a need to improve safety analyses and to shift safety considerations to early stages of design. The fault tree analysis is one traditional method applied to safety analyses. Its major limitations are that it requires detailed system knowledge and involves high manual efforts. To shift it to the early stages it is necessary to improve efficiency and to cope with abstract concepts. This paper therefore, improves a matrix-based approach to automatically generate fault trees to solve the named challenges. It extends it by integrating multi-hierarchy models and enabling the automated generation of AND-gates. By that, it provides a preliminary FTA tailored to the phase of system design. It identifies critical system elements and allows the comparison of alternative concepts.},

This experimental study aims to examine students’ acceptance and attitude towards the use of game-based applications, as well as analyze how game-based learning impacts the acquisition and development of basic competences. To this end, online questionnaire responses from 135 undergraduate computer science students were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results indicate that students perceive these tools as useful and easy to use, thus exerting a positive influence on learning motivation and behavior change towards the implementation of game-based learning. Furthermore, the crucial role of game-based learning strategies in the development of formative collaborative learning is emphasized, as well as their positive influence on the acquisition of essential soft skills for the comprehensive training of computer science students. The conclusions underscore the importance of considering the GBL approach as a valuable educational strategy to motivate and enhance learning and develop fundamental skills in students.},

  pages={27197-27207},
  abstract={We introduce Mind Artist (MindArt), a novel and efficient neural decoding architecture to snap artistic photographs from our mind in a controllable manner. Recently, progress has been made in image reconstruction with non-invasive brain recordings, but it's still difficult to generate realistic images with high semantic fidelity due to the scarcity of data annotations. Unlike previous methods, this work casts the neural decoding into optimal transport (OT) and representation decoupling problems. Specifically, under discrete OT theory, we design a graph matching-guided neural representation learning framework to seek the underlying correspondences between conceptual semantics and neural signals, which yields a natural and meaningful self-supervisory task. Moreover, the proposed MindArt, structured with multiple stand-alone modal branches, enables the seamless incorporation of semantic representation into any visual style information, thus leaving it to have multi-modal reconstruction and training-free semantic editing capabilities. By doing so, the reconstructed images of MindArt have phenomenal realism both in terms of semantics and appearance. We compare our MindArt with leading alternatives, and achieve SOTA performance in different decoding tasks. Importantly, our approach can directly generate a series of stylized “mind snapshots” w/o extra optimizations, which may open up more potential applications. Code is available at https://github.com/JxuanC/MindArt.},

  abstract={Object inpainting is a task that involves adding objects to real images and seamlessly compositing them. With the recent commercialization of products like Stable Diffusion and Generative Fill, inserting objects into images by using prompts has achieved impressive visual results. In this paper, we propose a prompt suggestion model to simplify the process of prompt input. When the user provides an image and a mask, our model predicts suitable prompts based on the partial contextual information in the masked image, and the shape and location of the mask. Specifically, we introduce a concept-diffusion in the CLIP space that predicts CLIP-text embeddings from a masked image. These diffused embeddings can be directly injected into open-source in-painting models like Stable Diffusion and its variants. Alternatively, they can be decoded into natural language for use in other publicly available applications such as Generative Fill. Our prompt suggestion model demonstrates a balanced accuracy and diversity, showing its capability to be both contextually aware and creatively adaptive.},

  abstract={We explore the potential of utilizing ChatGPT to automatically generate educational assessment questions. Despite the growing promise of ChatGPT across various natural language tasks, including question generation, there exists a challenge of producing content that is both reliable and desirable. This issue becomes particularly crucial in educational assessments, where the quality of the generated content and its alignment with the assessed material are paramount. This research examines questions produced by ChatGPT, focusing on their alignment with different levels of Bloom's Taxonomy and their overall fluency and coherence. To assess the quality of the generated questions, we establish several scenarios for generation and subsequently evaluate the questions using both automated metrics and manual examination. Our empirical analysis shows that ChatGPT tends to produce high-quality questions; however, these questions predominantly fall within the categories of Remember, Understand, and Apply in Bloom's Taxonomy. It exhibits limited capacity for generating questions that require higher-order reasoning. Further enhancements are therefore necessary to enhance the question quality of this model, particularly with regard to the diversity of question types based on Bloom's Taxonomy. This improvement is crucial to ensure the suitability of the generated questions for effective classroom assessments.},

  abstract={Spatial agents are widely involved in robotics, simulated situations in GIS and virtual environment. Most of these agents are controlled by high-level natural language instructions or driven by limited natural language stories coming from real people. This kind of spatial information is usually qualitative rather than quantitative and is often incomplete according to the human spatial cognitive nature. This paper presents an approach to qualitative spatial orientation reasoning in 3-dimensional spatial environment. Signs in three components represent qualitative orientations in 3D space with respect to each spatial agent. By using sign algebra and efficient methods for dealing with uncertainties, the paper proposes a method for qualitative orientation reasoning between different reference agents, from which an analytical mechanism is built. The presented method can be integrated into the perception-deliberation-action control loop in spatial agent environment.},

  abstract={Representative paths analysis generalizes and improves MPI critical path analysis. To improve diagnostic insight, we sample the distribution of program path costs and retain k representative paths. We describe scalable algorithms to collect representative paths and path profiles. To collect full paths efficiently, we introduce path pruning that reduces permanent space requirements from a trace (proportional to ranks and MPI events) to path length (the minimum). To make space requirements independent of ranks and events – even a small constant in practice – we profile program paths. Avoiding the limitations of prior path profiling approaches, we dynamically discover tasks and attribute costs in high resolution. We evaluate our algorithms on seven applications scaled up to 7000 MPI ranks. Full program paths use as little as 0.01% the permanent space of current methods; profiles require a nearly constant 100–1000KB. Execution overhead is under 5% when synchronization intervals are sufficiently large (a few milliseconds).},

  abstract={This paper proposes the implementation of Chat-GPT, a large language model, as a virtual peer for peer instruction in computer programming courses. The authors argue that AI tools, including ChatGPT, can bring benefits such as personalized learning, instant feedback, and active engagement to the classroom. An experiment was conducted with two groups of programming students: one receiving traditional instruction and the other utilizing the ChatGPT-based peer instruction model. Both groups were given the same programming assignments and assessments. The results indicated that the ChatGPT group outperformed the traditionally instructed group, demonstrating better programming skills and a deeper understanding of concepts. The ChatGPT group also reported higher engagement and satisfaction. However, some difficulties were observed when using ChatGPT for more abstract problems. Overall, the study highlights the effectiveness of using ChatGPT as a virtual peer to enhance active learning and student outcomes in computer programming courses, challenging biases regarding AI's potential benefits in education.

  abstract={Animation of topological transformations, such as fractures, cracks, tears, crumbles or fragmentations, is a new challenge in Computer Graphics and Animation. We propose a new way to model and animate topological changes, allowing the programmer to design any type of topological changes and animation mapping. This model is based on organizing the complex modeling activity into three clearly defined simpler sub-activities: 1) point-based animation, which enables a wide variety of possible temporal phenomena; 2) topological-based modeling, which makes it possible to manage a wide variety of shape-independent topologies and topological transformations; 3) free, non predetermined, association between both, and 4) final output of an animated geometrical model exhibiting any complex behavior. We experimented the proposed method by modeling tearing effects on deformable garments, on rifts and crack effects on 3D objects, and finally by modeling imaginary and paradoxical topological transformations associated with realistic Physics-based animation. Besides improving the consistency and the robustness of the modeling process of such complex phenomena, our aim is also to offer a user-centered programming environment to the Computer Graphics and Animation programmers and designers, to enlarge their modeling and experimentation abilities, and to stimulate their creativity.},

  abstract={Various attempts have been made throughout the history of artificial intelligence (AI) to incorporate emotional support in intelligent systems. Still some paths are left untraveled. This paper presents an attempt to model emotions as a complex system based on the hypothesis that mind state can be considered as an emergent phenomena resulting from autonomous, interactive, elementary entities called emotions. Inspiration for our approach is found in Buddhist philosophical concepts about thought formation by combination of emotions. Multi Agent Systems (MAS) technology has been used for the realization of above emotional model because interactions and emergence are intrinsic features of MAS. Capabilities of the model are exposed through a virtual agent application called EME who perceives, understands, uses and expresses emotions. Evaluation of the agent implementation has shown good results in achieving emotional intelligence with enhanced quality.},

  abstract={One of the most prominent research goals in the field of mobile autonomous robots is to create robots that are able to adapt to new environments, i.e., the robots should be able to learn during their "lifetime" possibly without (or a minimum) of human intervention. When employing artificial neural networks (ANNs) to control the robot, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques are a good candidate for achieving continuous on-line learning. A problem with RL applied to robot learning is that the state (and action) space of a robot is typically not discrete. Thus, the robot had to evaluate an infinite number of possible actions at every time step in order to select the best. To overcome this problem we add a second network module to the neurocontroller acting as a memory of previous decisions (state-action pairs) of the robot. The robot's actual decisions, then, are based on previous decisions retrieved from memory. Additionally, intrinsic noise in the memory network gives the robot the possibility to evaluate new "ideas", hence it becomes creative. We analyze the potential of the above approach by measuring the ability of (simulated) robots to learn simple tasks using temporal difference (TD) learning.},

Solving problems of this type continuously throughout CS studies enables the students to grasp the CS professional work, and in particular the role of mathematics in the work of proficient programmers.

  title={Student Assessment in PBL-Based Teaching Computing: Proposals and Results}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-9},
  abstract={This Research Full Paper presents an overview of student assessment proposals for Problem-Based Learning (PBL) in Computing Education. Computing teaching has many challenges, as it requires different skills from students, often subjective and difficult to assess. In fact, technical knowledge alone is not enough to fully understand what is being taught, but the interpretive and logical skills to deal with practical problems and non-technical skills such as group work, creativity, critical vision, ability to cooperate and communicate. Active learning methodologies as Problem-Based Learning (PBL) have been used to dealing with such challenges, broadly developing technical and non-techniques skills in students. However, despite the benefits of PBL, the student assessment process is one of the points that present its own adversities and, therefore, an aspect that deserves greater attention. To better understand the nuances of this process and how it can contributes to the teaching and learning process based on PBL, this study aimed to investigate primary studies in the last two decades, seeking answers to the following research questions: RQ1) What assessment models are being used?; RQ2) Which aspects are evaluated?; RQ3) What criteria and media have been defined?; RQ4) Who gets involved in the assessment process?; RQ5) What is the ideal frequency to conduct the evaluations?; RQ6) What can these models reveal? As a research method, this study used the Systematic Literature Review method proposed by Kitchenham. As main conclusions, it was possible to identify that: generally, computing education based on PBL occurs at the undergraduate level, having as main educational objective the teaching of technical content; in practice, the need for a diverse teaching team is not reflected, the traditional student-teacher remains; to evaluate students, it is necessary to consider several aspects, technical and non-technical, defining specific criteria for each one of them; the main benefits for students are related to changes in behavior, development of soft skills and better absorption of technical knowledge; as main challenges for students, the difficulty to understand the nuances of the proposed problem and to be the main responsible for devising a solution for it without the figure of a teacher to give a clear definition of how to do it stands out.},

  abstract={Corporate university (CO) become a trend in organizations. However, functional characteristics are little explored by CO for boosting knowledge creation. One of them is functional diversity that has been pointed as a factor to increase innovation, contributing for the development of clear strategies and quick responses to changes at workplace. On the other hand, an appropriate distribution of roles helps to promote individual responsibility and group cohesion. It also contributes to the strengthening of positive interdependence of group members. These aspects are fundamental to the development of cooperative work. In this work, we propose a model for group formation for learning approaching dichotomous functional roles and preferred roles in order to improve the group performance into the courses offered by CO at Court of Justice of Goiás (CJG). From the proposed model, we constructed three group formation algorithms. The first algorithm forms groups randomly (AA). The second is a canonical genetic algorithm (CGA). The third is a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA). After, we performed a comparative analysis of the results reached by the three algorithms. We observed that the HGA achieves superior results than the CGA and AA.},

  abstract={Mitigating hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) remains an open problem. Recent benchmarks do not address hallucinations in open-ended free-form responses, which we term “Type I hallucinations”. Instead, they focus on hallucinations responding to very specific question formats-typically a multiple-choice response regarding a particular object or attribute-which we term “Type II hallucinations”. Additionally, such benchmarks often require external API calls to models which are subject to change. In practice, we observe that a reduction in Type II hallucinations does not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations but rather that the two forms of halluci-nations are often anti-correlated. To address this, we propose THRONE, a novel object-based automatic framework for quantitatively evaluating Type I hallucinations in LVLM free-form outputs. We use public language models (LMs) to identify hallucinations in LVLM responses and compute informative metrics. By evaluating a large selection of recent LVLMs using public datasets, we show that an improvement in existing metrics do not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations, and that established benchmarks for measuring Type I hallucinations are incomplete. Finally, we provide a simple and effective data augmentation method to reduce Type I and Type II hallucinations as a strong baseline.},

  abstract={Increased data availability has stimulated the interest in studying sports prediction problems via analytical approaches; in particular, with machine learning and simulation. We characterize several models that have been proposed in the literature, all of which suffer from the same drawback: they cannot incorporate rational decision-making and strategies from teams/players effectively. We tackle this issue by proposing hybrid simulation logic that incorporates teams as agents, generalizing the models/methodologies that have been proposed in the past. We perform a case study on the NBA with two goals: i) study the quality of predictions when using only one predictive variable, and ii) study how much historical data should be kept to maximize prediction accuracy. Results indicate that there is an optimal range of data quantity and that studying what data and variables to include is of extreme importance.},
