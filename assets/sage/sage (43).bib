abstract = {The selection of coals for pulverised coal injection usually consists of evaluating the carbonaceous matter. However, the reduction of permeability in the lower section of the blast furnace with high rates of pulverised coal injection can be associated with remaining ashes from the coal combustion process. The aim of this work is to evaluate the behaviour of coal ashes at high temperatures in relation to their chemical and mineralogical composition. These ashes were submitted to the following analysis: chemical (X-ray fluorescence), mineralogical (X-ray diffraction), fusibility (heating microscopy) and viscosity (rotational viscometer). The software FactSage was also used to evaluate the behaviour of coal ashes. It was observed that samples present different chemical and mineralogical compositions, reflecting in the fusibility and viscosity of ashes. Their proportions and relevant phases were determined by computational thermodynamics and also related to the experimental work.}

abstract = {Genetic variations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can cause susceptibility to cancer. Although thousands of genetic variants have been identified to be associated with different cancers, the molecular mechanisms of cancer remain unknown. There is not a particular dataset of relationships between cancer and SNPs, as a bipartite network, for computational analysis and prediction. Link prediction as a computational graph analysis method can help us to gain new insight into the network. In this article, after creating a network between cancer and SNPs using SNPedia and Cancer Research UK databases, we evaluated the computational link prediction methods to foresee new SNP-Cancer relationships. Results show that among the popular scoring methods based on network topology, for relation prediction, the preferential attachment (PA) algorithm is the most robust method according to computational and experimental evidence, and some of its computational predictions are corroborated in recent publications. According to the PA predictions, rs1801394-Non-small cell lung cancer, rs4880-Non-small cell lung cancer, and rs1805794-Colorectal cancer are some of the best probable SNP-Cancer associations that have not yet been mentioned in any published article, and they are the most probable candidates for additional laboratory and validation studies. Also, it is feasible to improve the predicting algorithms to produce new predictions in the future.}

abstract = {Visual Cryptography (VC) has drawn much attention for providing the service of secret communication. Basically, VC is the process of encoding a secret into several meaningless shares and later decoding the secret by superimposing all or some of the shares without any computation involved. VC has been adopted to support some practical applications, such as image authentication, visual authentication, image hiding, and digital watermarking. Unfortunately, in many applications, VC has been shown to suffer from the “cheating problem” in which the disclosed secret image may be altered by malicious insiders who are called “cheaters.” While ubiquitous computing has been well developed, it has recently occurred to people in both academia and industry that research could benefit more from computational VC by introducing light-weight computation costs in the decoding phase. In this paper, a simple scheme is proposed to conquer the cheating problem by facilitating the capability of share authentication. It is worthwhile to note that the proposed scheme can identify for certain whether cheating attacks have occurred or not, while other schemes that have the same objective frequently provide a vague answer. In addition, the proposed scheme effectively addresses the two main problems of VC, i.e., the inconvenience of meaningless share management and the challenge of achieving difficult alignment.}

abstract = {In this study, a computational model is developed using finite-element techniques within a continuum micromechanics framework to capture the effect of electron-hopping-induced conductive paths at the nanoscale which contribute to the macroscale piezoresistive response of the nanocomposite. This is achieved by tracking the position of the nanotubes under applied deformations and modifying the conductivity of the intertube region depending on the relative proximity of individual pairs of nanotubes. The formation and disruption of the electron-hopping pathways are highly dependent on intertube distances and under deformations can result in microstructural rearrangements in terms of electrostatic properties leading to transitions in material symmetries and component magnitudes of the effective electrostatic properties. Thus, in order to capture the complexities of changing inhomogeneous nanoscale electrostatic behavior, where analytical Eshelby’s approaches cannot be used, a computational micromechanics model is needed. The effective conductivity and piezoresistive strain tensor coefficients are evaluated using volume-averaged energy equivalencies for aligned CNT–polymer nanocomposites in the transverse direction exploring different volume fractions of CNTs in the polymer and the maximum electron-hopping range. The impact of the electron-hopping mechanism on the effective piezoresistive response is studied through the macroscale effective gauge factors under different loading conditions. The effective piezoresistive strain coefficients and macroscale effective gauge factors are observed to be nonlinear with applied macroscale strain and are highly dependent on the type of boundary conditions. The effective macroscale gauge factors observed in the current study have magnitudes comparable to experimental observations reported in the literature with higher gauge factors observed closer to the percolation threshold.}

This commentary examines overlooked, and under-researched limitations of data science applications in the social sector—the volume, quality, and context of the available data that currently exists in social service systems require unique considerations. We explore how the presence of small data within the social service contexts can result in extrapolation; if not properly considered, data science can negatively impact the organizations data scientists are trying to assist. We conclude by proposing three ways data scientists interested in working within the social services sector can enhance their contributions to the field: refining and leveraging available data, improving collaborations, and respecting data limitations.}

Recently, we have adopted Byrne and Kirlik’s (2002) cognitive-ecological approach to determine what strategies work best in different task environments. In the work reported here, we took one computational cognitive model and, holding all else constant, swapped in and out alternative strategies for target acquisition.

abstract = {Background: Recent studies on lateral knee anatomy have reported the presence of a true ligament structure, the anterolateral ligament (ALL), in the anterolateral region of the knee joint. However, its biomechanical effects have not been fully elucidated. Purpose: To investigate, by using computer simulation, the association between the ALL and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) under dynamic loading conditions. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study; Level of evidence, 5. Methods: The authors combined medical imaging from 5 healthy participants with motion capture to create participant-specific knee models that simulated the entire 12 degrees of freedom of tibiofemoral (TF) and patellofemoral (PF) joint behaviors. These dynamic computational models were validated using electromyographic data, muscle activation data, and data from previous experimental studies. Forces exerted on the ALL with ACL deficiency and on the ACL with ALL deficiency, as well as TF and PF contact forces with deficiencies of the ACL, ALL, and the entire ligament structure, were evaluated under gait and squat loading. A single gait cycle and squat cycle were divided into 11 time points (periods 0.0-1.0). Simulated ligament forces and contact forces were compared using nonparametric repeated-measures Friedman tests. Results: Force exerted on the ALL significantly increased with ACL deficiency under both gait- and squat-loading conditions. With ACL deficiency, the mean force on the ALL increased by 129.7% under gait loading in the 0.4 period (P < .05) and increased by 189% under high flexion during the entire cycle of squat loading (P < .05). A similar trend of significantly increased force on the ACL was observed with ALL deficiency. Contact forces on the TF and PF joints with deficiencies of the ACL, ALL, and entire ligament structure showed a complicated pattern. However, contact force exerted on TF and PF joints with respect to deficiencies of ACL and ALL significantly increased under both gait- and squat-loading conditions. Conclusion: The results of this computer simulation study indicate that the ACL and the ALL of the lateral knee joint act as secondary stabilizers to each other under dynamic load conditions.}

abstract = {A detailed understanding of the air–fuel mixing process in gasoline direct injection engines is necessary to avoid soot formation that might result from charge inhomogeneities or liquid fuel impingement on the cylinder walls. Within this context, the use of multidimensional models might be helpful to better understand how spray evolution in cylinder charge motions and combustion chamber design affects the mixture quality at spark-timing. In this work, the authors developed and applied a computational fluid dynamics methodology to simulate gas exchange and air–fuel mixture formation in gasoline direct injection engines. To this end, a suitable set of spray submodels was implemented into an open-source code to properly describe the evolution of gasoline jets emerging from multihole atomizers. Furthermore, the complete liquid film dynamics was also considered. For a proper assessment of the approach, a gasoline direct injection engine running at full load was simulated and effects of spray targeting and engine speed were studied. A detailed postprocessing of the computed data of liquid film mass, homogeneity index and equivalence ratio distributions was performed and correlated with experimental data of particulate emissions. Satisfactory results were achieved, proving the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in predicting the effects of injection system and operating conditions on soot formation.}

The primary objective is to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of conventional models implemented to study the mechanics of the articular cartilage tissue and chondrocytes. From monophasic material models as the simplest form to more complicated multiscale theories, these approaches have been frequently used to model articular cartilage and have contributed significantly to modeling joint mechanics, addressing and resolving numerous issues regarding cartilage mechanics and function. It should be noted that attentiveness is important when using different modeling approaches, as the choice of the model limits the applications available. In this review, we discuss the conventional models applicable to some of the mechanical aspects of articular cartilage such as lubrication, swelling pressure and chondrocyte mechanics and address some of the issues associated with the current modeling approaches. We then suggest future pathways for a more realistic modeling strategy as applied for the simulation of the mechanics of the cartilage tissue using multiscale and parallelized finite element method.}

abstract = {In-cylinder water injection is a promising approach for reducing NOx and soot emissions from internal combustion engines. It allows one to use a higher compression ratio by reducing engine knock; hence, higher fuel economy and power output can be achieved. However, water injection can also affect engine combustion and emission characteristics if water injection and injector parameters are not properly set. Majority of the previous studies on the water injection are done through experiments. Therefore, subtle aspects of water injection such as in-cylinder interaction of water sprays, spatial distribution of water vapor, and effect on flame propagation are not clearly understood and rarely reported in literature due to experimental limitations. Thus, in the present article, a computational fluid dynamics investigation is carried out to analyze the effects of direct water injection under various injector configurations on water evaporation, combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of a gasoline direct injection engine. The emphasis is given to analyze in-cylinder water spray interactions, flame propagation, water spray droplet size distribution, and water vapor spatial distribution inside the engine cylinder. For the study, the water-to-fuel ratio is varied from 0 to 1. Various water injector configurations using nozzle hole diameters of 0.14, 0.179, and 0.205 mm, along with nozzle holes of 4, 5, 6, and 7, are considered for comparison in addition to the case of no_water. Computational fluid dynamics models used in this study are validated with the available data in literature. From the results, it is found that the emission and performance characteristics of the engine are highly dependent on water evaporation characteristics. Also, the water-to-fuel ratio of 0.6 with 6 number of nozzle holes and the nozzle diameter of 0.14 mm results in the highest indicated mean effective pressure and the lowest NOx, soot, and CO emissions compared to other cases considered.}

Results In a majority of models with nozzle-like strictures, especially those positioned asymmetrically, abnormal flow pattern was revealed, with significant flow separation and regions with reversed flow. Abnormal valves had no significant impact on flow in a case of already altered flow evoked by stricture in upper part of the vein. Conclusions In our jugular model, cranially-located stenoses, which in clinical practice are primarily caused by external compression, cause more significant outflow impact respect to endoluminal defects and pathological valves located more caudally.}

abstract = {Hybrid porous tilting pad bearings with the advantages of gas porous bearings and tilting pad bearings exhibited excellent rotor-supporting performance with high accuracy and stability. Under hybrid lubrication, the transient adaptive motion of the tilting pads was important for the rotordynamic characteristics. A novel fluid–structure interaction model of hybrid porous tilting pad bearings was developed to investigate the transient hydro forces and the pad’s adaptive motion. The rotordynamic coefficients of the hybrid porous tilting pad bearings were identified using the rotor harmonic trajectory. The computational fluid dynamics-fluid–structure interaction model was validated with the experimental data. The effects of eccentricity ratios, rotor speeds, supply pressures, pivot radial stiffnesses, and dampings on the pad adaptive motion and the rotordynamic coefficients were evaluated. The pad self-adaption motions significantly influenced the supporting and vibration-absorbing characteristics of hybrid porous tilting pad bearings.}

abstract = {Little use is made of multiple processors available on current supercomputers (computers with a theoretical peak performance capability equal to 100 MFLOPS or more) to improve turnaround time in computational aerodynamics. The productivity of a computer user is directly related to this turnaround time. In a time-sharing environment, such improvement in this speed is achieved when multiple processors are used efficiently to execute an algorithm. We apply the concept of mul tiple instructions and multiple data (MIMD) through multitasking via a strategy that requires relatively minor modifications to an existing code for a single processor. This approach maps the available memory to multiple processors, exploiting the C-Fortran-Unix interface. The existing code is mapped without the need for devel oping a new algorithm. The procedure for building a code utilizing this approach is automated with the Unix stream editor.}

abstract = {A theoretical computational method to evaluate the performance characteristics of cycloidal propellers is presented. Starting from Taniguchi’s method, improvements have been derived to make it applicable for various eccentricities in the whole advance coefficient region. First the effect of the curved orbit of the blades and the blade rotation is taken into account, that influences camber and zero lift angle. Then the effect of low Reynolds number on drag coefficient and the effect of stalling on lift coefficient are analysed and discussed in detail. Some linearizations are given up to improve the computation accuracy. The improved method is described. Using this improved method to compute the performance of a DTNSRDC model and comparing the results with systematic experiment results (see DTNSRDC Report 2983), it is shown that the agreement between them is quite good for a larger range of advance ratios and eccentricities.}
