abstract = {Active student engagement, teaching via experience in real-life settings and learning by doing, are pedagogical strategies appropriate to improve student-reasoning skills. By building models, performing investigations, examining and explaining experimental results, using theoretical and computational thinking, constructing representations, undergraduates can acquire a deeper understanding of fundamental disciplinary concepts while reinforcing transversal abilities. In this framework, Engineering courses should be designed with the final objective to develop practical skills, focusing on hands-on activities. This contribution presents two different inquiry-based learning environments recently experienced at the University of Palermo in the context of bioelectronic and biomedical Engineering. The first study describes a laboratory activity about digital ophthalmologic signal classification; the second laboratory focuses on the analysis of the prefrontal cortex activation during a memory task using functional Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (fNIRS). We introduce and discuss the learning workshops, with the research objective of improving current instruction and training in Engineering courses. Indeed, this contribution aims to suggest a conceptual framework in the form of a structured elective suite of modules tailored to meet the needs of Engineering graduates. The outcomes of both studies seem to highlight that self-directed learning activities could enhance students’ enthusiasm to learn and engagement in engineering investigations, contributing to improve the achievements of students and acquire a more effective learning approach.}

abstract = {The computer science (CS) unplugged approach intends to teach CS concepts and computational thinking skills without employing any digital tools. The current study conducted a systematic literature review to analyze research studies that conducted investigations related to implementations of CS unplugged activities. A systematic review procedure was developed and applied to detect and subsequently review relevant research studies published from 2010 to 2019. It was found that 55 research studies (17 articles + 38 conference proceedings) satisfied the inclusion criteria for the analysis. These research studies were then examined with regard to their demographic characteristics, research methodologies, research results, and main findings. It was found that the unplugged approach was realized and utilized differently among researchers. The majority of the studies used the CS unplugged term when referring to “paper–pencil activities,” “problem solving,” “storytelling,” “games,” “tangible programming,” and even “robotics.”}

abstract = {This article examines the articulation of computational journalism, focusing on how the meaning of the computational is discursively constructed and mobilized as a specific constellation of intelligibility within news organizations. Relying on the concept of articulation developed in cultural studies, the article asks what, exactly, is meant by the computational in the context of journalism? Drawing on interviews with key managerial staff, editors and developers at Scandinavian news organizations, three broad claims about the linkage between the computational and journalism emerged. These articulations include the notion that machines don’t have instincts, that democracy can never be personalized and finally that the computational is something to think with, rather than simulate. The argument is made that what can and cannot be calculated is not merely a technical question, it is also a deeply social, cultural, political and economic one. Thus, the computational emerges as an important organising framework and discursive order for thinking and talking about journalism in the digital age.}

This work presents a systematic review of the available R CRAN sport packages following PRISMA guidelines. We consider all packages active as of 18 February 2021. A total of 81 sport R packages created since 2006 were detected. Of these, 35.9% were authored by an American national, 69.1% include a dataset, 43.2% provide vignettes, and 65.4% have been updated at least once. The sport with the highest representation is basketball (n = 14, 17.3%), followed by soccer (n = 12, 14.8%) and packages related to physical activity (n = 11, 13.6%). There are no sports packages directed solely for the female gender, while 59.3% of packages are focused on professional athletes. Fifty packages (61.7%) are related to the sports performance analysis category, and web scraping (n = 43, 53.1%) was the main functionality in the collected packages. The creation of new R packages in the area of sports could help solve questions and tasks that still remain a challenge in this field, while continuing to help to improve the level of statistical education and computational thinking skills.}

abstract = {Reintroducing computer science (CS) education in K–12 schools to promote computational thinking (CT) has attracted significant attention among scholars and educators. Among the several essential components included in CS and CT education, program debugging is an indispensable skill. However, debugging teaching has often been overlooked in K–12 contexts, and relevant empirical studies are lacking in the literature. Moreover, novices generally have poor performance in domain knowledge and strategic knowledge concerning debugging. They also consistently experience a high cognitive burden in debugging learning. To address these gaps, we developed a flipped systematic debugging approach combined with a systematic debugging process (SDP) and the modeling method. A quasi-experimental study was conducted to explore the effectiveness of this flipped systematic debugging approach, in which 83 fifth-grade students attended the flipped debugging training lessons with the SDP–modeling method, and 75 fifth-grade students attended the unassisted flipped debugging training lessons without the SDP–modeling method. The results indicated that flipped debugging training using the SDP–modeling method improved students’ debugging skills. The results from the questionnaire showed that the proposed teaching approach increased the students’ investment in germane cognitive load by promoting schema construction. It also helped reduce students’ intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load in learning.}

The umbrella term computational exploration in journalism (CEJ), embraces the multifaceted development of algorithms, data, and social science methods in reporting and storytelling. CEJ typically involves the journalistic co-creation of quantitative news projects that transcend geographical, disciplinary, and linguistic boundaries. Drawing on extensive empirical data, this article provides a conceptual overview of the field by identifying three main pathways of computational exploration in journalism: the newsroom approach, the academic approach, and the entrepreneurial approach. Implications for changing journalistic practice are discussed, and the theorizing is summed up in a triplex proposition about changing mindset processes coming out of CEJ. The study indicates that the computational exploration not only leads to innovative uses of the technology, but also to innovative ways for journalists to think and behave; journalism innovation leads to innovation journalism.}

abstract = {The ever-increasing computational requirements of HPC and service provider applications are becoming a great challenge for hardware and software designers. These requirements are reaching levels where the isolated development on either computational field is not enough to deal with such challenge. A holistic view of the computational thinking is therefore the only way to success in real scenarios. However, this is not a trivial task as it requires, among others, of hardware–software codesign. In the hardware side, most high-throughput computers are designed aiming for heterogeneity, where accelerators (e.g. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), etc.) are connected through high-bandwidth bus, such as PCI-Express, to the host CPUs. Applications, either via programmers, compilers, or runtime, should orchestrate data movement, synchronization, and so on among devices with different compute and memory capabilities. This increases the programming complexity and it may reduce the overall application performance. This article evaluates different offloading strategies to leverage heterogeneous systems, based on several cards with the first-generation Xeon Phi coprocessors (Knights Corner). We use a 11-point 3-D Stencil kernel that models heat dissipation as a case study. Our results reveal substantial performance improvements when using several accelerator cards. Additionally, we show that computing of an approximate result by reducing the communication overhead can yield 23% performance gains for double-precision data sets.}

abstract = {As visions of smart urbanism gain traction around the world, it is crucial that we question the benefits that an increasingly technologised urbanity promise. It is not about the technology, but bettering peoples’ lives, insist smart city advocates. In this paper, I question the progressive potential of the smart city drawing on the case of Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative. Using the case studies of the smart home and ‘learning to code’ movement, I highlight the limits of such ‘smart’ interventions as they are stunted by the neoliberal-developmental logics of the state, thereby facilitating authoritarian consolidation in Singapore. As such, this paper distinguishes itself from previous works on the neoliberal smart city by situated smart urbanism within the socio-political dynamics of neoliberalism-as-developmental strategy. For smart urbanism to better peoples’ everyday lives, technological ‘solutionism’ needs to be replaced with more human-centric framings and understandings of urban challenges.}

This paper argues that the emergence of smart libraries have changed the paradigms of library by acknowledging the potential benefits and transformation smart library brings to library operations and services. It notes that analytical and computational thinking, data literacy, information literacy, social intelligence, programs and project management, cross-cultural competency, transliteracy, transdisciplinary, design thinking and mindset, virtual collaboration and cognitive load management are skills to be possessed by smart librarians. It highlights cloud computing, big data, 3D printing, IoT, Artificial Intelligence, RFID, drones etc., as the emerging technologies used for smart libraries and further discusses smart services, smart people, smart places and smart governance as the dimensions of smart library. Revelations are further made that smart libraries aid space saving, expansion of library working hours and services and promotes access to information, while remarks are made that lack of technological know-how, technophobia, data privacy and security, etc., are the challenges of smart library. It concludes that the emergence of smart library have facilitated the redefinition of library services and operations and recommends amongst others that librarians should continuously update their skills so that they can meet up with competitions that may arise from the challenges of globalisation of the information landscape.}

A curriculum mapping of 63 undergraduate courses was conducted with course learning outcomes aligned against two benchmarks. The first benchmark was the Ten Skills for the Future Workforce which identifies key employability skills graduates will require in the coming decade. The second benchmark was the Australian Qualifications Framework Specification for the Bachelor Degree which defines the generic skills graduates must obtain through Australian Bachelor Degrees. This curriculum mapping reveals that Australian music technology courses teach Novel and Adaptive Thinking, Computational Thinking, New Media Literacy, and Design Mindsets universally. However, this curriculum mapping also reveals a deficit in employability skills related to Cross-Cultural Competency, Transdisciplinarity, Virtual Collaboration, and Collaboration more generally. The implications of this mapping is that Australian music technology educators seem to be prioritizing specific technical and creative skills over higher-order applications of skills and knowledge which are contextualized in their broader social and cultural contexts. Finally, this article shows how curriculum mapping can be implemented to embed employability skills progressively across a program sequence using a case study from the School of Music, University of Queensland.}

abstract = {Traditional harmonic analysis annotations can be represented in a computer model of a piece of music by plain text strings. But whenever automated processing like analysis, comparison or retrieval is intended, a formal definition is helpful. This should cover not only the syntactic structure, but also the semantics, i.e. the intended meaning, and thus adheres to the technique of mathematical remodelling of existing cultural phenomena. The resulting models can serve as a basis for automated processing, but also help to clarify the communication and discussion among humans substantially. This article proposes such a definition in four layers, which address different problems of encoding and communication: (a) relation of symbol sequences to staff positions, (b) combining functions, (c) chord roots, and (d) interval structure and voice leading. Only one of them is specific to functional (Riemannian) theory and can possibly be replaced to represent scale degree theory. The proposal is configurable to different interval specification methods and open to localisation. Syntax and semantics are defined by precise mathematical means, borrowed from computer science, and thus are unambiguously documented.}

Two teacher educators recently implemented a series of readings and activities in their methods courses designed to help preservice teachers sophisticate their conceptions of texts beyond autonomous, neutral collections of information by considering digital age ideas such as software theory, textual ideology, and the algorithmic bias of the Internet. The authors review recent scholarship surrounding the integration of computational thinking and the humanities before illustrating a theoretical framework that combines software-driven interpretation and critical media literacy. Descriptions and applications of course texts and exercises precede a discussion on typological methodology. Through the analysis of semester-long writing reflections and course interactions, a typology of preservice teachers is then presented, illustrating three archetypes: Strategists, Hawkeyes, and Improvers. These archetypes are taken up to analyze the ways in which a range of teacher candidates considered ontological notions of digital texts to analyze instructional techniques, to sharpen their critical lenses, or to gain greater understanding of ELA as a discipline (or some combination of all three). This work demonstrates that as teacher educators and teacher candidates increasingly consider software-powered literacies, interrogations of who we are, who we are becoming, and what it all means requires attention to, and explicit practice with, the dark side of digital texts.}

abstract = {The recent shift in compulsory education from ICT-focused computing curricula to informatics, digital literacy and computer science, has resulted in children being taught computing using block-based programming tools such as Scratch, with teaching that is often limited by school resources and teacher expertise. Even without these limitations, Scratch users often produce code with ‘code smells’ such as duplicate blocks and long scripts which impact how they understand and debug projects. These code smells can be removed using procedural abstraction, an important concept in computer science rarely taught to this age group. This article describes the design of a novel educational block-based programming game, Pirate Plunder, which concentrates on how procedural abstraction is introduced and reinforced. The article then reports an extended evaluation to measure the game’s efficacy with children aged 10 and 11, finding that children who played the game were then able to use procedural abstraction in Scratch. The article then uses game analytics to explore why the game was effective and gives three recommendations for educational game design based on this research: using learning trajectories and restrictive success conditions to introduce complex content, increasing learner investment through customisable avatars and suggestions for improving the evaluations of educational games.}

abstract = {Background: There has been a dearth of research on intersectional identities in STEM, including the fields of computing and engineering. In computing education research, much work has been done on broadening participation, but there has been little investigation into how the field of computer science (CS) presents opportunities for students with strong intersectional identities. This study explores the strengths and connections among the unique identities and the symbiotic relationships that elementary Latina students hold in CS identity attainment. Purpose: The aim of this article is to better understand how predominantly low-income, multilingual Latina students experience identity development through the lens of diverse group membership. We examine how young Latinas, through their participation in a yearlong culturally and linguistically responsive CS curriculum, leverage their intersecting identities to rewrite the formula of what a computer scientist is and can be, leaving space to include and invite other strong identities as well. Research Design: An explanatory sequential mixed-methods design was used that analyzed data from predominantly low-income, multilingual Latinas in upper elementary grades, including pre- and post-CS identity surveys (N = 50) delivered before and after implementation of the curriculum, and eight individual semi-structured student interviews. Findings: We found that Latina students developed significantly stronger identification with the field of CS from the beginning to the end of the school year with regard to their experiences with CS, perception of themselves as computer scientists, family support for CS and school, and friend support for CS and school. Interviews revealed that perception of their CS ability greatly influenced identification with CS and that girls’ self-perceptions stemmed from their school, cultural, and home learning environments. Conclusion: Our results highlight the wealth of resources that Latinas bring to the classroom through their home- and community-based assets, which are characterized by intersecting group membership. Students did not report on the intersection between language and CS identity development, which warrants further investigation.}

This article discusses the benefits to students of introducing CDS into the university curriculum with a focus on developing skills in cheminformatics, data analysis, structure–activity relationships, modelling and simulation. Moreover, CDS can enable students to engage with complex chemical and toxicological data in new and dynamic ways, helping them to develop a more nuanced understanding of the potential hazards and risks associated with different chemicals and substances. On the other hand, it can foster greater collaboration between students and faculty and with external partners in industry and government. This can lead to the development of more effective and efficient toxicological testing methods and tools to screen chemicals for potential hazards and aid the development of environmentally friendly chemicals. Overall, the integration of CDS into the university curriculum will help prepare the next generation of scientists giving them a competitive edge to make considerable contributions to green chemistry, designing safer chemicals and non-animal testing methods. It will enable them to tackle modern challenges facing society including identifying safer and more sustainable chemicals and predicting the health and environmental impacts of novel chemical substances.}

abstract = {Research on ‘digital’ journalism has focused largely on online news, with comparatively less interest in the longer-term implications of software and computational technologies. Drawing upon a 6-year study of the Toronto Star, this article provides an account of TOPS, an in-house web content management system which served as the backbone of thestar.com for 6 years. For some, TOPS was a successful software innovation, while for others, a strategic digital ‘property’. But for most journalists, it was slow, deficient in functionality, aesthetically unappealing and cumbersome. Although several organizational factors can explain TOPS’ obstinacy, I argue for particular attention to the complex ontology of software. Based on an outline of this ontology, I suggest software be taken seriously as an object of journalism, which implies acknowledging its partial autonomy from human use or authorization, accounting for its ability to mutate indefinitely and analysing its capacity to encourage forms of ‘computational thinking’.}

abstract = {To explore the role of design thinking in contemporary computer literacy education, this study aimed to examine the relationship between young students’ design thinking disposition and their computer programming self-efficacy. To assess students’ design thinking disposition, this study developed the Design Thinking Disposition Scale (DTDS) with a sample of 350 junior high school students who had computer programming experience in a STEAM course. A principle axis factor analysis with the promax rotation method was used to verify the DTDS’s construct under the four dimensions: empathize, define, ideate and prototype. The Cronbach’s alpha reliability was .90 for the overall scale. Correlation analyses results showed that all the four dimensions were significantly correlated with computer programming self-efficacy assessed by CPSES. A significant regression model was found in which the three factors, ideate, prototype and define, significantly predicted the overall computer programming self-efficacy. Meanwhile, except for the ideate subscale, no gender difference was found in the young students’ design thinking dispositions. The students’ self-directed programming learning experience was shown to benefit their design thinking disposition. The DTDS can be applied to design-thinking-embedded computer literacy curricula such as makers, STEAM, or robotics education. Several further studies are also suggested.}

abstract = {Parquet Deformation is an architectural studio exercise introduced by William Huff in 1960s. It aims to improve students’ reasoning of spatiotemporal variation by utilizing sequential shapeshifting of patterns. This article examines the outcomes of this educational research from a perspective of design computing with a purpose to remark its pedagogical significance. A multilayered reading about the exercise will reveal its historical, theoretical, and artistic backgrounds. Then the common structural elements and different construction approaches are explained along with a novel design and analysis method. The proposed method embeds variations of two-dimensional pattern deformations on a third dimension. It enables various analyses such as the measurement of regularity and locating the attractor points. This study is expected to exemplify how computational thinking and new digital tools change the way designers would approach to such systematic compositions.}
