abstract = {The paper suggests a focused examination of the processes of drafting-based design and parametric design in urbanism. It discusses how spatial design’s settled cognition would differ by using algorithmic systems through the altered relationships between the basic operations in design. To reveal the commonalities and distinctions between the two design methods, the authors present the detailed documentation of the workshop series, which experimented with both techniques within similar design contexts. By the design analysis, the idea of “parametric thinking” is revisited in the specific context of urban design.}

abstract = {Abstract This study was carried out to assess the ability of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code to predict the scavenging flow in the cylinder of a two-stroke cycle engine. Predictions were obtained from a CFD simulation of the flow within the cylinder. Due to the apparent sym-metry of the engine port layout, only half of the cylinder volume was modelled. Boundary conditions for the CFD model were obtained from experimentally measured pressure-time histories in the crankcase and exhaust. The two-stroke cycle engine was modified to allow laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) measurements to be made of the in-cylinder flow. The engine was operated under motoring conditions at 500 r/min with a delivery ratio of 0.7. Although the engine scavenge port layout was geometrically symmetrical, an asymmetrical flow field was identified in the cylinder. As a result of this, a direct comparison of the in-cylinder LDV measured and CFD computed results was not possible. However, LDV and CFD results for the in-cylinder flow are presented to help highlight the dissimilarity between the measured and predicted flow fields. Two-dimensional LDV measurements were made in the cylinder at the transfer ports for a portion of the cycle. A comparison of these LDV measurements with CFD predictions of the in-cylinder velocities at the same locations showed that the CFD model could replicate reasonably well the general trend of the flow. The measured cylinder averaged turbulent kinetic energy was compared with that of the CFD model. The qualitative trend of the overall turbulence generating capacity of the engine was well replicated by the CFD model.}

abstract = {Purpose A pilot study evaluated the feasibility of a curriculum that overtly teaches computer programming while covertly scaffolding social-communication skills for autistic children aged 8–12 years. Methods Participants were taught the Python programming language so they could program their own chatbots to greet a human user and discuss different topics, taking turns during the discussion, as though the chatbot were a human itself. The students were challenged with creating chatbots that pass the ‘Turing Test’, where a human evaluator would not be able to tell whether their chatbots were humans or computer programs. The curriculum included didactic instruction, peer-group discussion, homework and the chatbot project. Six autistic children participated in the six-session program. Feasibility was assessed using questionnaires and qualitative feedback. Results The curriculum is deemed feasible and desirable. There was no measurable change in social-communication skills immediately following the six-session program. Participants and their parents were highly interested in similar programs in the future, suggesting promising potential for further development and refinement. Conclusion A curriculum of programming a chatbot that also covertly scaffolds social communication is feasible for autistic children who are interested in computer programming.}

abstract = {Fuels based on admixtures of methane/natural gas and hydrogen are a promising way to reduce CO2 emissions of spark ignition engines and increase their efficiency. A lot of work was conducted experimentally, whereas only limited numerical work is available in the context of three-dimensional modelling of the full engine cycle. This work addresses this fact by proposing a reactive computational fluid dynamics modelling framework to consider the effects of hydrogen addition on the combustion process. Part I of this two-part study focuses on the modelling and crucial considerations in order to predict the mean cycle based on the G-equation combustion model using the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. There, the effect of increased burning speed was globally captured by increasing the flame speed coefficient A, appearing in the considered flame speed closure. The proposed simplified modelling of the early flame stage proved to be robust for the conducted hydrogen variation from 0 to 50 vol% H2 for stoichiometric and lean operation. Scope of this work, Part II, are cyclic fluctuations and the hydrogen influence thereon using large eddy simulation and the proposed modelling framework. The model is probed towards its capabilities to predict the fluctuation of the combustion process for 0 and 50 vol% H2 and correlations influencing the observed peak pressure of the individual cycle are presented. It is shown that the considered approach is capable to reproduce the cyclic fluctuations of the combustion process under the influence of hydrogen addition as well as lean operation. The importance of the early flame phase with respect to arising fluctuations is highlighted as well as the contribution of the resolved scales in terms of the flame front wrinkling.}

As a mode of instruction, thinking aloud was first employed by teachers who modeled their processing during reading, making overt the strategies they were using to comprehend text. Subsequently, instructional approaches were developed to engage students themselves in thinking aloud. Such endeavors revealed facilitation effects on text understanding. Current efforts to engage students in constructing meaning from text in collaborative discussions seem to indicate a new direction for thinking aloud research, one in which social interaction assumes increased importance.}

This review selected and analyzed 17 studies published from 1987 to 2022 in peer-reviewed journals using a rigorous five-stage scoping framework. Data extraction and analysis were conducted in Covidence. The results revealed eight types of technological tools used to enhance creativity in the music classroom, in which sequencer software and GarageBand were the most commonly used type of technological tools and applications respectively. Technology’s support for creativity was also discussed from the perspectives of Lubart’s four roles of computers: (a) computer as nanny, (b) computer as pen-pal, (c) computer as coach, and (d) computer as colleague. The results showed a dearth of research on how technology can become students’ partners to help them generate creative ideas.

abstract = {The paper assesses the effect on the air flow regime underneath a simplified high-speed train of changing the ballast depth and the sleeper shape, with regard to its potential for causing ballast flight or pickup. The study was carried out numerically using the commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software AnSys Fluent. The flow profile beneath the underbody of the train was generated by means of a moving wall above the track. The Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (DDES) with the SST turbulence model was used to simulate turbulent flow, and the ballast bed roughness was applied parametrically using the wall roughness feature when resolving the boundary layer. CFD simulations were validated for flow over a cube, showing good agreement with experimental results. Up to three different depths to the ballast surface and three different sleeper profiles were investigated. Velocity profiles and aerodynamic forces on cubes placed between or on top of the sleeper blocks were used to assess the propensity of individual ballast grains for movement. For a standard G44 sleeper, increasing the ballast depth and/or the ballast bed roughness was found to reduce aerodynamic loads on an individual ballast grain. A ballast grain on top of the sleeper is more prone to uplift than a grain on the surface of the ballast bed in the crib. A curved upper surface to the sleeper is beneficial in that it prevents ballast from settling on top, the most vulnerable position. However, the reduced flow separation associated with the curved top may increase the likelihood of ballast pickup from the crib. Hence new sleeper shapes intended to reduce the potential for ballast flight should not only prevent ballast from settling on top, but also increase flow separation through the provision of a sharp surface. A prismatic sleeper shape that achieves both is suggested.}

Hydrodynamic performance of both non-cavitating and cavitating marine propellers is first analyzed by viscous and potential based flow solvers. In viscous solver, sheet cavitation on propeller blades is simulated with Schnerr–Sauer cavitation model based on Rayleigh Plesset equation using volume of fluid approach. Numerical hydrodynamic results based on viscous solver is compared with potential solver and then validated with experimental data of benchmark David Taylor Model Basin 4119 model propeller. Later, noise spectrum of model propellers is predicted by a hybrid method which combines Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes and Ffowcs Williams Hawkings equations. Computed noise spectrum is compared with other numerical studies in the literature for the selected model propeller. In addition, hydrodynamic and hydroacoustic pressures are compared in near field to show reliability of numerical solution. Effects of blade number on hydrodynamic performance and noise spectrum are also investigated. Numerical results indicated that as blade number increases, propeller noise level decreases for different loading conditions due to decreased blade loading (circulation) per blade. However, propeller efficiency increases as blade number decreases.}

abstract = {A theoretical study is presented for predicting the hygrothermal behavior of laminated composite plates during moisture desorption. This investigation is aimed at overcoming the computational difficulties in the determination of transient hygroscopic stress distribution through laminated plates and in the evaluation of the effect of anisotropy on the evolution of such stresses. To calculate such stresses during desorption phase, we present a new method by which we are able to predict directly the evolution of transient hygroscopic stresses within laminated composite plates without the calculation of moisture concentrations as in the case of Benkeddad’s method in which we are obliged to determine the moisture distribution across the plate before the calculation of such stresses. This is very important and must be taken into account in the design of composite material, particularly aerospace structures for example, aircraft. The second part of this investigation is devoted to the analysis of the effect of anisotropy on the hygrothermal behavior of laminated plates during moisture desorption. The polar representation method of anisotropic properties is selected as a convenient tool for this study. By this method, the author is able to assess the anisotropy of composite laminated plates using the degree of anisotropy. Some stacking sequences with different in-plane degree of anisotropy were investigated in order to show the effect of anisotropy on the transverse hygroscopic stresses. Finally, the results of this paper can be used to guide the derivation of future by opening a way for the optimal design of composite structures submitted to a moist environment.}

Students learn these topics through the execution of computer experiments. The first set of experiments cover the numerical approximation of heat conduction in a ring, and a second set cover the numerical approximation of the reaction and diffusion of chemicals that will produce the markings on an animal’s tail.

To describe the filtration performance, particles trajectories, and the influence of structural parameters of fibrous media, the computation fluid dynamics is adopted. The filtration efficiency and the pressure drop of fibrous media are calculated in computation fluid dynamics and semi-analytical model. It is found that the arrangement types have significant effects on the filtration efficiency and show the limitation of the semi-analytical model. With the Stokes number larger than 1, the numerical results and semi-analytical model have great consistency in the filtration efficiency for the “Mesh” and “Para” types than “Nurbs” type. Meanwhile, the pressure drop between the numerical results and the semi-analytical model is always consistent.}

abstract = {The U.S. confronts an unprecedented public health crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, in the presidential election year in 2020. In such a compound situation, a real-time dynamic examination of how the general public ascribe the crisis responsibilities taking account to their political ideologies is helpful for developing effective strategies to manage the crisis and diminish hostility toward particular groups caused by polarization. Social media, such as Twitter, provide platforms for the public’s COVID-related discourse to form, accumulate, and visibly present. Meanwhile, those features also make social media a window to monitor the public responses in real-time. This research conducted a computational text analysis of 2,918,376 tweets sent by 829,686 different U.S. users regarding COVID-19 from January 24 to May 25, 2020. Results indicate that the public’s crisis attribution and attitude toward governmental crisis responses are driven by their political identities. One crisis factor identified by this study (i.e., threat level) also affects the public’s attribution and attitude polarization. Additionally, we note that pandemic fatigue was identified in our findings as early as in March 2020. This study has theoretical, practical, and methodological implications informing further health communication in a heated political environment.}

abstract = {Diphyllin-7′-O-β-D-glucoside, a podophyllotoxin derivative, was isolated from the roots of Dysosma versipellis. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra acquired at 300 K exhibited doubling of signals, suggesting the existence of two rotamers in solution. Variable-temperature 1H NMR experiments indicated a dynamic exchange process between the two rotamers. DFT calculations verified nearly equal energies for the two rotamers about the single bond C7′-O7.}
