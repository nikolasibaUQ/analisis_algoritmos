abstract = {Using the test scores of more than 1,000,000 students who participated in the Advanced Placement Computer Science (AP CS) exams from 1997 to 2020, this study examined the direction and magnitude of the trends in gender disparity in participation and top achievement in advanced exams. The findings indicated that the male-to-female ratio (MFR) among AP Computer Science (CS) exam participants declined from 4.87 to 2.26 between 1997 and 2020. Similarly, the MFR among top scorers (students who scored 5 out of 5) in any type of AP CS exams declined rapidly, in favor of female students, from 8.00 to 2.14 during the same period. Possible implications of these findings for educators, particularly for AP CS teachers and school counselors, were also discussed in the context of the underrepresentation of females in computing fields.}

abstract = {There is a currently a shortage of computer science professionals and this shortage is projected to continue into the foreseeable future as not enough students are selecting computer science majors. Researchers and policy-makers agree that development of this career pipeline starts in elementary school. Our study examined which collaborative programming setup, pair programming (two students collaborate on one computer) or side-by-side programming (two students collaborate on the same program from two computers), fifth-grade students preferred. We also sought to understand why students preferred one method over the other and explored ideas on how to effectively design a collaborative programming environment for this age group. Our study had participants first engage in five instructional days, alternating between pair and side-by-side programming, and then conducted focus groups. We found that students overwhelmingly preferred side-by-side programming. We explain this using self-determination theory which states that behavior is motivated by three psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and psychological relatedness which side-by-side programming was better able to meet.}

abstract = {Within the context of the growing polarisation and fragmentation of the urban landscape, this paper presents a computational typology applicable to the study of minority communities, both ethnic and religious, which is useful in understanding their spatial distribution and juxtaposition at neighbourhood levels. The typology has been applied to multicultural London with the use of the 2001 Census, in which there were questions on ethnicity and religion. The landscape of religion is found to be more highly segregated in contrast to the landscape of ethnicity. Furthermore, on the basis of a preliminary analysis of indicator variables, minorities seem on aggregate to be in an improved situation given a level of residential segregation, with the exception of residents of segregated Asian-Bangladeshi areas for ethnicity and residents of segregated Muslim areas for religion. This questions the generally held view that segregation in a multicultural society is undesirable per se and suggests that a ‘one size fits all’ government policy towards residential segregation is insufficiently perceptive. The typology introduced here should facilitate a more critically informed approach to multiculturalism and the contemporary city.}

abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been widely adopted to identify the Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the construction industry and determine its high environmental impact through Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, energy and resource consumptions. The consideration of LCA in the early stages of design is becoming increasingly important as a means to avoid costly changes at later stages of the project. However, typical LCA-based tools demand very detailed information about structural and material systems and thus become too laborious for designers in the conceptual stages, where such specifications are still loosely defined. In response, this paper presents a workflow for LCA-based evaluation where the selection of the construction system and material is kept open to compare the impacts of alternative design variants. We achieve this through a strict division into support and infill systems and a simplified visualization of a schematic floor layout using a shoebox approach, inspired from the energy modelling domain. The shoeboxes in our case are repeatable modules within a schematic floor plan layout, whose enclosures are defined by parametric 2D surfaces representing total ratios of permanent supports versus infill components. Thus, the assembly of modular surface enclosures simplifies the LCA evaluation process by avoiding the need to accurately specify the physical properties of each building component across the floor plan. The presented workflow facilitates the selection of alternative structural systems and materials for their comparison, and outputs the Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the form of an intuitive visualization output. The workflow for simplified evaluation is illustrated through a case study that compares the GWP for selected combinations of material choice and construction systems.}

abstract = {In this article, a typical submersible well pump was investigated to study the effects of inter-stage leakage on the inner flow field and external characteristics. The whole flow field of the model pump with different seal clearances was simulated by computational fluid dynamics software. The inter-stage clearance leakage calculated by numerical simulation was compared with the values obtained by the empirical formula. The pressure values were recorded with the arrangement of monitor points in the inter-stage clearance, inlet region, and outlet region, which aimed to study the effects of the change of inter-stage clearance pressure on the pump performance. Meanwhile, a comparative analysis of numerical simulation and performance test of the pump was conducted further. The results showed that the leakage at the small clearance is close to the value calculated using empirical formula. But when the clearance is large, the discrepancy between the simulation result and empirical value inclines. Comparing the numerical results of three kinds of clearance leakage, we found that the clearance leakage could not be ignored in the simulation since it has a large effect on the prediction of pump efficiency and head.}

abstract = {A fully coupled thermomechanical finite element analysis of the friction-stir welding (FSW) process developed in the authors’ previous work is combined with the basic physical metallurgy of Ti—6Al—4V to predict/assess the structural response of FSW joints. A close examination of the experimental results reported in the open literature reveals that in most cases the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of the weld possesses the most inferior properties and tends to control the overall structural performance of the weld. Taking this observation into account, a microstructure evolution model is developed and parameterized for the Ti—6Al—4V material residing in the HAZ. Specifically, this model addresses the problem of temporal evolution of the globular α-phase particles located within prior β-phase grains (the dominant microstructural parameter in the HAZ) during the FSW process. Next this model is combined with the well-established property versus microstructure correlations in Ti—6Al—4V in order to predict the overall structural performance of the weld. The results obtained are found to be in reasonably good agreement with their experimental counterparts, suggesting that the present computational approach may be used to guide the selection of FSW process parameters in order to optimize the structural performance of FSW joints (at least while they are controlled by the HAZ-material microstructure/properties).}

The aim of this study is to assess the application of time-periodic supply velocities to enhance mixing in mixing ventilation cases to reduce heating and cooling energy demands. This paper presents computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of a generic mixing ventilation case, in which the time-averaged velocities and pollutant concentrations from a reference case with constant supply velocities were compared with those obtained from a case with time-periodic supply velocities (sine function). The unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) CFD simulations indicate that the use of time-periodic supply velocities can reduce high pollutant concentrations in stagnant regions, reduces the overall time-averaged pollutant concentrations and increases contaminant removal effectiveness with about 20%. The influence of the period of the sine function was assessed and the results showed that for the periods tested, the differences are negligible. Finally, the URANS approach was compared with the large eddy simulations (LES) approach, indicating that URANS leads to very similar results (NMSE < 3.2%) as LES and can thus be regarded as a suitable approach for this study.}

Validation of the model was investigated based on hydrodynamic parameters such as bed expansion ratio, H/H0, gas volume fraction profile, bubble behaviour, and motion of the particles. A good agreement was found between numerical results and experimental values. The model was used to study a bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) including the ring baffles. Predicted results show that the ring baffles have an important role in the flow pattern of the bed. Baffles increase the bed expansion height and particle velocities at axial locations on the top of the highest baffle as well as uniform distribution of gas volume fraction between the baffles area. In spite of increasing the dead zones in the bed, ring baffles cause the improvement of mixing and heat transfer in the bed. The present study provides a useful basis for further works on the effect of baffles in BFBs.}

abstract = {This article examines how the ‘refugee crisis’, sparked by the arrival of refugees from the Syrian civil war and other conflicts around the world, was articulated across Dutch television news programs and social media between 2013 and 2018. This crisis has been described as a key catalyst of the radicalization of European political discourse. Crucially, it took shape during a period of profound transformation of the media landscape, in which mass media lost significant ground to social media as authoritative sources of truth and norms. The research focuses on the crucial but underexplored link between television and social media discourse, which is at the heart of contemporary European public debate. Using a combination of digital methods and NLP techniques, the article compares automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts of Dutch televised news on the refugee crisis with responses from publics on Facebook and Twitter. This computational cross-media approach enables a longitudinal analysis of how social media users differ in their interpretation of key events characterizing the crisis, as well as what language is acceptable to debate issues around integration, tolerance and identity. A rejection of mainstream news media editorial guidelines by social media users eventually resulted in their consumption of populist right-wing (‘alternative’) news media and active transgression of anti-discriminatory speech norms.}

abstract = {In this factor-analytic study of imaging and thinking, measures of vivid visual and auditory imaging loaded onto a unitary “vivid imaging” factor, on which no measures of thinking loaded. This first factor-analytic finding, like previous findings of no correlation between vivid imaging and productive thinking, is consistent with Külpe’s classic argument and Kunzendorf’s contemporary argument that visually and auditorily imaged sensations are not building blocks for “spatial” and “temporal” thinking, respectively, but are sensory representations which vivid imagers construct from their imageless thoughts. Moving beyond individual differences in vivid imaging to individual differences in imageless thinking, this factor-analytic study found, in addition, that radically different measures of styles of thought load onto a unitary “heterarchical versus hierarchical thinking” factor. These differing measures of thinking styles instructed research participants to find embedded spatial and temporal patterns, to organize two unstructured data sets into matrices or outlines, and to rank their preferences for 12 competitive events—6 events defined by “how close, “how high,” or “how far” competitors can perform on a heterarchical measure, and 6 events defined by “how well synchronized,” “how long,” or “how fast” competitors can perform on a hierarchical measure. Engineering students in this research exhibited significantly more heterarchical thinking and significantly less hierarchical thinking; management students exhibited significantly less heterarchical thinking and significantly more hierarchical thinking; and male students and female students exhibited, on average, no significant differences in their modes of thinking. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that people’s “imageless thinking” can be characterized in terms of two orthogonal modes of thinking: heterarchical thinking and hierarchical thinking.}

abstract = {Advanced combustion concepts, like homogeneous charge compression ignition, are limited by their narrow operating range, which stems from a lack of control over the heat release process. This study explores a new advanced combustion mode, called thermally stratified compression ignition, which uses a direct water injection event to control the heat release process in low-temperature combustion. A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model coupled with detailed chemical kinetics is used to better understand the effects of direct water injection on thermal stratification in the cylinder and the resulting heat release process. Previous results showed that increasing the injection pressure results in a significantly broader temperature distribution due to increased evaporative cooling. In this way, direct water injection can control low-temperature combustion heat release and extend significantly the operable load range. In this study, simulations were performed over a range of start of injection timings in order to determine its effect on thermal stratification and heat release. The results show that for both low and high injection pressures advancing the start of water injection results in increased thermal stratification and reduced peak pressure and heat release rate for injections occurring after −60 °CAD. Before −60 °CAD, advancing the water injection has a varied effect on thermal stratification and heat release depending on the injection pressure and mass of the injected water.}

Three single hole injectors with the bore size of 0.101, 0.122, and 0.133 mm are experimented with injection pressures of 140, 45, and 38 MPa respectively to achieve similar injection rate profile. Diesel spray experiments implement Diffused Backlight Illumination Technique where diffused background is obtained for the High Speed Video camera imaging. Experimental results are then validated with computational and analytical studies. The CFD simulation requires the injection rate profile and spray cone angle as a primary input; thus, based on the High Speed Video Camera start of injection frame the 5 kHz Butterworth low-pass frequency filter is applied to the injection rate raw data. While, the spray cone angle is predicted using a simple model obtained from the relationship between the injection velocity, fluctuating velocity at the nozzle exit and total pressure loss factor of the injector. The experimental spray tip penetration of all three injectors is almost identical as the similar injection rate profile is adopted. Although, the mixture characteristics are better for 0.101 mm hole diameter since the smaller hole diameter with highest injection pressure depicts larger spray angle and better atomization. The computational study agrees with experiments qualitatively; however, the quantitative and qualitative agreements are seen in the analytical study.}

abstract = {Background Endoscopic medial maxillectomy (EMM) is a workhorse for multiple sinonasal conditions. To reduce its burden on the sinonasal physiology, several modified EMM (M-EMM) have been proposed. Objective: In order to provide a theoretical basis for EMM and its modifications, this study introduces a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, based on a time-resolved direct numerical simulation, describing EMM and assessing the role of the M-EMM in preserving the overall fluid dynamics of the sinonasal cavities. Methods A normal sinonasal CT scan was converted into a geometrical model and used as a reference; 2 anatomies were then created by virtual surgery, mimicking EMM and M-EMM, with the latter sparing the anterior portion of inferior turbinate and medial maxillary sinus wall. The airflow was simulated in the models via the OpenFOAM CFD software and compared in terms of flow rate, mean and fluctuating velocity, vorticity, and turbulent structures. Results The analysis shows that EMM induces a massive flow rate increase in the operated side, which becomes less obvious in the M-EMM model. In contrast to M-EMM, EMM induces higher velocity fields that reach the maxillary sinus. Velocity and vorticity fluctuations are negligible in the baseline model, but become increasingly evident and widespread in the M-EMM and EMM models. Conclusions A significant disruption of the nasal fluid dynamics is observed in EMM, while M-EMM minimizes variations and reduces interference with nasal air conditioning. Our analysis provides insights into the pathophysiology of radical sinus surgery and provides a theoretical basis for the ability of M-EMM to reduce the temporary surgery-related changes on both healthy and operated sides.}

The ability of a three-dimensional, unstructured, unsteady RANS solver in successfully predicting the wind flow interactions with a rotating, twisted and tapered rotor is described. The uRANS equations were coupled with SST κ-ω turbulence model and a correlation-based Gamma-Theta transition model. The simulations were performed in ANSYS CFX using both Single Reference Frame (SRF) and Multiple Reference Frame (MRF) modelling approaches. A good agreement with measurements is observed at six of seven wind speeds when comparing the integral quantities, the spanwise and chordwise distributions.

abstract = {The wing of an unmanned aerial vehicle, RQ-7 Shadow, is modified to study the changes in the aerodynamics of the wing. The main focus is to investigate the effects of changing the components of wing design when the aircraft climbs and accelerates. These component modifications included changing the airfoil, planform, aspect ratio, and adding a winglet. Another objective is to study the efficacy of employing high-lift airfoils like the EPPLER 559 for subsonic unmanned aerial vehicle applications. For this, five wing designs are considered in this paper. Computational fluid dynamics simulations using ANSYS FLUENT® are conducted for each wing design. The CL/CD ratios for all the wings are calculated at increasing angles of attack (simulating Climbing) and increasing speed (simulating Acceleration). Compared to the NACA 4415 airfoil, which is utilized by the RQ-7 Shadow, the EPPLER 559 provides an increase in lift at the low angles of attack, but yields less of these benefits as the angle of attack increases. The tapered planform significantly reduces the high drag associated with the EPPLER 559 airfoil. The generation of higher lift forces with lower drag is further achieved by increasing the aspect ratio and through the addition of a winglet. When compared to the NACA 4415 airfoil, it is concluded that the EPPLER 559 airfoil is a viable candidate for subsonic unmanned aerial vehicle applications only when the components of wing design are altered. The performance of the wings that employ the EPPLER 559 airfoil improves when the planform is changed from rectangular to tapered, when the aspect ratio is increased and when a winglet is added.}

abstract = {Introduction: Tuberculosis is a major respiratory disease globally with a higher prevalence in Asian and African countries than rest of the world. With a larger population of tuberculosis patients anticipated to be co-infected with COVID-19 infection, an ongoing pandemic, identifying, preventing and managing drug–drug interactions is inevitable for maximizing patient benefits for the current repurposed COVID-19 and antitubercular drugs. Methods: We assessed the potential drug–drug interactions between repurposed COVID-19 drugs and antitubercular drugs using the drug interaction checker of IBM Micromedex®. Extensive computational studies were performed at a molecular level to validate and understand the drug–drug interactions found from the Micromedex drug interaction checker database at a molecular level. The integrated knowledge derived from Micromedex and computational data was collated and curated for predicting potential drug–drug interactions between repurposed COVID-19 and antitubercular drugs. Results: A total of 91 potential drug–drug interactions along with their severity and level of documentation were identified from Micromedex between repurposed COVID-19 drugs and antitubercular drugs. We identified 47 pharmacodynamic, 42 pharmacokinetic and 2 unknown DDIs. The majority of our molecular modelling results were in line with drug–drug interaction data obtained from the drug information software. QT prolongation was identified as the most common type of pharmacodynamic drug–drug interaction, whereas drug–drug interactions associated with cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibition and induction were identified as the frequent pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions. The results suggest antitubercular drugs, particularly rifampin and second-line agents, warrant high alert and monitoring while prescribing with the repurposed COVID-19 drugs. Conclusion: Predicting these potential drug–drug interactions, particularly related to CYP3A4, P-gp and the human Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene proteins, could be used in clinical settings for screening and management of drug–drug interactions for delivering safer chemotherapeutic tuberculosis and COVID-19 care. The current study provides an initial propulsion for further well-designed pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic-based drug–drug interaction studies. Plain Language Summary Introduction: Tuberculosis is a major respiratory disease globally with a higher prevalence in Asian and African countries than rest of the world. With a larger population of tuberculosis patients predicted to be infected with COVID-19 during this period, there is a higher risk for the occurrence of medication interactions between the medicines used for COVID-19 and tuberculosis. Hence, identifying and managing these interactions is vital to ensure the safety of patients undergoing COVID-19 and tuberculosis treatment simultaneously. Methods: We studied the major medication interactions that could likely happen between the various medicines that are currently given for COVID-19 and tuberculosis treatment using the medication interaction checker of a drug information software (Micromedex®). In addition, thorough molecular modelling was done to confirm and understand the interactions found from the medication interaction checker database using specific docking software. Molecular docking is a method that predicts the preferred orientation of one medicine molecule to a second molecule, when bound to each other to form a stable complex. Knowledge of the preferred orientation may be used to determine the strength of association or binding affinity between two medicines using scoring functions to determine the extent of the interactions between medicines. The combined knowledge from Micromedex and molecular modelling data was used to properly predict the potential medicine interactions between currently used COVID-19 and antitubercular medicines. Results: We found a total of 91 medication interactions from Micromedex. Majority of our molecular modelling findings matched with the interaction information obtained from the drug information software. QT prolongation, an abnormal heartbeat, was identified as one of the most common interactions. Our findings suggest that antitubercular medicines, mainly rifampin and second-line agents, suggest high alert and scrutiny while prescribing with the repurposed COVID-19 medicines. Conclusion: Our current study highlights the need for further well-designed studies confirming the current information for recommending safe prescribing in patients with both infections.}
