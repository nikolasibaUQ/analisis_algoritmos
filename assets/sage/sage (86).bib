abstract = {Lime stabilization is a common technique used to improve the engineering properties of clayey soils. The process of lime stabilization can be split into two parts. First, the mobilization and crowding of ions or molecules from hydrated lime at net negative surface charge sites on expansive clay colloids. Second, the formation of pozzolanic products including calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) because of reactions within lime-soil mixtures. The pozzolanic reaction is generally considered to be more durable, while the adsorption has been associated with more easily reversible consistency changes. This study offers a protocol to assess whether the stabilization process is dominated by durable C-S-H (pozzolanic) reactions or a combination of cation exchange and pozzolanic reactions. Expansive clays with plasticity indices >45% from a major highway project in Texas are the focus of lime treatment in this study. The protocol consists of subjecting lime-soil mixtures to a reasonable curing period followed by a rigorous but realistic durability test and investigating the quality and quantity of the pozzolanic reaction product. Mineralogical analyses using quantitative X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicates the formation of different forms of C-S-H. In addition, geochemical modeling is used to simulate the lime-soil reactions and evaluate the effect of pH on the stability of C-S-H. The results indicate C-S-H with Ca/Si ratio of 0.66 as most the stable form of C-S-H among other forms with Ca/Si ratio ranging from 0.66 to 2.25. The effect of reducing equilibrium pH on C-S-H is also evaluated. A reduction in pH favored dissolution of all forms of C-S-H indicating the need to maintain a pH ≥ 10.}

abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 has been highly susceptible to mutations since its emergence in Wuhan, China, and its subsequent propagation due to containing an RNA as its genome. The emergence of variants with improved transmissibility still poses a grave threat to global health. The spike protein mutation is mainly responsible for higher transmissibility and risk severity. This study retrieved SARS-CoV-2 variants structural and nonstructural proteins (NSPs) sequences from several geographic locations, including Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, and North and South America. First, multiple sequence alignments with BioEdit and protein homology modeling were performed using the SWISS Model. Then the structure visualization and structural analysis were performed by superimposing against the Wuhan sequence by Pymol to retrieve the RMSD values. Sequence alignment revealed familiar, uncommon regional among variants and, interestingly, a few unique mutations in Beta, Delta, and Omicron. Structural analysis of such unique mutations revealed that they caused structural deviations in Beta, Delta, and Omicron spike proteins. In addition, these variants were more severe in terms of hospitalization, sickness, and higher mortality, which have a substantial relationship with the structural deviations because of those unique mutations. Such evidence provides insight into the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein vulnerability toward mutation and their structural and functional deviations, particularly in Beta, Delta, and Omicron, which might be the cause of their broader coverage. This knowledge can help us with regional vaccine strain selection, virus pathogenicity testing, diagnosis, and treatment with more specific vaccines.}

abstract = {This paper argues that analyses of the ways in which Big Data has been enacted in other academic disciplines can provide us with concepts that will help understand the application of Big Data to social questions. We use examples drawn from our Science and Technology Studies (STS) analyses of -omic biology and high energy physics to demonstrate the utility of three theoretical concepts: (i) primary and secondary inscriptions, (ii) crafted and found data, and (iii) the locus of legitimate interpretation. These help us to show how the histories, organisational forms, and power dynamics of a field lead to different enactments of big data. The paper suggests that these concepts can be used to help us to understand the ways in which Big Data is being enacted in the domain of the social sciences, and to outline in general terms the ways in which this enactment might be different to that which we have observed in the ‘hard’ sciences. We contend that the locus of legitimate interpretation of Big Data biology and physics is tightly delineated, found within the disciplinary institutions and cultures of these disciplines. We suggest that when using Big Data to make knowledge claims about ‘the social’ the locus of legitimate interpretation is more diffuse, with knowledge claims that are treated as being credible made from other disciplines, or even by those outside academia entirely.}

Participants were 15 6th grade secondary school students enrolled in an IT course at a public secondary school. Observations, screenshots and interviews were analyzed together to find out what students do and what they think during problem solving process. As a result, three main steps (focus, fight and finalize) were extracted from students’ behavioral patterns. The results suggest that three steps occur in linear or cyclic manner with regard to the programming constructs required for the solution of the problem. Implications for instructors who desire to provide a better learning experience on problem solving through block-based programming are also included.}

abstract = {This article reviews some of the recent work on the remarkable cognitive capacities of food-caching corvids. The focus will be on their ability to think about other minds and other times, and tool-using tests of physical problem solving. Research on developmental cognition suggests that young children do not pass similar tests until they are at least four years of age in the case of the social cognition experiments, and eight years of age in the case of the tasks that tap into physical cognition. This developmental trajectory seems surprising. Intuitively, one might have thought that the social and planning tasks required more complex forms of cognitive process, namely Mental Time Travel and Theory of Mind. Perhaps the fact that children pass these tasks earlier than the physical problem-solving tasks is a reflection of cultural influences. Future research will hope to identify these cognitive milestones by starting to develop tasks that might go some way towards understanding the mechanisms underlying these abilities in both children and corvids, to explore similarities and differences in their ways of thinking.}

abstract = {The computational metaphor of organisms as phenotypic automata controlled by a genetic programme has been replaced by the cognitive metaphor of organisms as intelligent agents making decisions about how to use their genomic and environmental resources. This metaphor facilitates novel ways of thinking about organisms that defy the assumptions of the old machine metaphor. But like all metaphors, the cognitive metaphor discloses important similarities at the expense of eclipsing significant dissimilarities. I argue that although cognitivism carries with it the crucial insight that living organisms are agents rather than mere automata, this metaphor distorts the nature of biological agency by over-intellectualizing, which risks eliminating the distinction between life and mind. I trace the Cartesian root of these metaphors and argue that it generates a dilemma between mechanism and intellectualism. To capture the middle path that most organisms occupy between these two extremes, I propose an ecological account of natural agency.}

Lattice Boltzmann method simulations are performed for three different cooler lengths (Lc = H/4, H/2, H) placed along the middle of one vertical wall for a wide range of Rayleigh and Hartmann numbers (103 ≤ Ra ≤ 105; Ha = 0, 60, 120) at fixed Prandtl number (Pr = 0.71, air). A partial heater is placed at the center of other vertical walls and its size is kept as half of the characteristic length (H/2). The physical insights of the systems are delineated by systematic analysis of stream function and temperature contours. Heat transfer characteristics of the cavity are elucidated by using averaged values of the Nusselt number. It is noted that average Nusselt number has a proportional dependence with cooler length and Rayleigh number, while it varied inversely with Hartmann number. Further, the functional dependence of average Nusselt number with cooler size, Rayleigh number, and Hartmann number is established for possible use in engineering design purpose.}

abstract = {Leaders have been classified as having charismatic, ideological, or pragmatic (CIP) leadership styles, each characterized by distinct patterns in cognition and interaction. Although each CIP style has been shown to facilitate certain aspects of the creative process for followers, questions remain regarding the impact of leadership style on overall follower creative performance. One factor likely to influence this relationship is leader distance, composed of the physical distance, perceived social distance, and perceived task interaction among leaders and followers. Past research has also emphasized the role of leaders’ mental models as they relate to follower performance. Less understood, however, is how the mental models of followers may affect this process. Using the CIP model of leadership, this study explores leader distance and leader–follower mental model congruence on follower creative performance. Results indicated that while leadership style does not directly influence follower creativity, it interacts with leader distance to shape creative outcomes. Results further indicated that while general mental model congruence is not predictive, alignment on specific mental model dimensions contributes to enhanced creative performance among followers. Implications and future research directions are discussed.}

Specifically, we examined the responsiveness of 260 seventh grade students identified as MD or MDRD to a 6-week treatment (SBI) on measures of proportional problem solving. Results indicated that students in the SBI condition significantly outperformed students in the control condition on a measure of proportional problem solving administered at posttest (g = 0.40) and again 6 weeks later (g = 0.42). The interaction between treatment group and students’ difficulty status was not significant, which indicates that SBI was equally effective for both students with MD and those with MDRD. Further analyses revealed that SBI was particularly effective at improving students’ performance on items related to percents. Finally, students with MD significantly outperformed students with MDRD on all measures of proportional problem solving. These findings suggest that interventions designed to include effective instructional features (e.g., SBI) promote student understanding of mathematical ideas.}

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to perform an in silico evaluation of bovine meat proteins as potential precursors of biologically active peptides, as well as to determine whether such peptides can be released by selected proteolytic enzymes. The sequences of 19 bovine meat proteins were processed using the BIOPEP database and program. The profiles of potential biological activity of protein fragments were determined and the following parameters were calculated: the frequency of occurrence of fragments with given activity (A), the frequency of release of fragments with given activity by selected enzymes (AE), and the relative frequency of release of fragments with given activity by selected enzymes (W). Among the examined proteins, collagen and elastin appear to be the richest potential source of bioactive peptides, in particular of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, antithrombotic fragments, inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase IV and peptides regulating gastric mucosal activity. The high number of bioactive fragments in collagen and elastin is associated with a high content of glycine and proline, amino acids that are most abundant in biologically active fragments. Of the two investigated proteolytic enzymes, Proteinase K — an enzyme with broad specificity (e.g., against peptide bonds formed by the carboxyl groups of proline) can release considerably more biologically active fragments than Proteinase P1 — an enzyme with narrow specificity, not including proline residues.}

This research suggests that future computational design algorithms could benefit from incorporating scenario-based methods developed in the field of evidence-based design, in which studies are concerned about improving qualitative goals. Through this case study, we describe the process of prototyping a computational design algorithm based on the Functional Scenario Analysis approach, applying the algorithm to evaluate case studies, visualizing findings, and extracting design strategies based on the analysis results. This method offers a new vision of how computational design can benefit informed decision-making processes and generate design alternatives aligned with a project’s design goals.}

The learning is supported by information affordances including a wiki learning management system (LMS) housing the curriculum, organized design activities, social media features, tutorials and informational assignments. Students engage in a Constructionist blended learning setting in their classroom, and work collaboratively in teams on game design. The study draws on qualitative video data from six team cases using a coding scheme of categories for the concepts of task, collaborative information seeking (CIS) Modality, and inquiry resolution outcomes. The study also considers linkages between processes and learning outcomes. Variation in engagement across the categories among students was charted, and certain patterns emerged. Findings indicate that some categories of task appear related to some categories of students’ chosen CIS Modality for solving problems. Further, CIS processes in support of tasks appear related to inquiry incident resolution (resolved/unresolved). For student completion of advanced programming tasks in particular, we observe more frequent uses of the wiki-based LMS resources, and greater levels of challenge in fulfilling tasks. Results support existing work on these theoretical constructs in the information sciences, and lead to questions on how naturalistic emergence of CIS practices result from greater task knowledge, and whether learned CIS practices (as tasks in and of themselves) can yield project task knowledge gains. Findings of the study and the ongoing questions the work invites hold instructional design implications, and show how social constructivist educational contexts involving collaborative and information seeking and knowledge building among youth game designers can contribute to scholarly understanding of these processes more broadly in related project-based work contexts occurring among both youth and adults.}

abstract = {The notion that the Earth has entered a new epoch characterized by the ubiquity of anthropogenic change presents the social sciences with something of a paradox, namely, that the point at which we recognize our species to be a geologic force is also the moment where our assumed metaphysical privilege becomes untenable. Cultural geography continues to navigate this paradox in conceptually innovative ways through its engagements with materialist philosophies, more-than-human thinking and experimental modes of ontological enquiry. Drawing upon the philosophy of Gilbert Simondon, this article contributes to these timely debates by articulating the paradox of the Anthropocene in relation to technological processes. Simondon’s philosophy precedes the identification of the Anthropocene epoch by a number of decades, yet his insistence upon situating technology within an immanent field of material processes resonates with contemporary geographical concerns in a number of important ways. More specifically, Simondon’s conceptual vocabulary provides a means of framing our entanglements with technological processes without assuming a metaphysical distinction between human beings and the forces of nature. In this article, I show how Simondon’s concepts of individuation and transduction intersect with this technological problematic through his far-reaching critique of the ‘hylomorphic’ distinction between matter and form. Inspired by Simondon’s original account of the genesis of a clay brick, the article unfolds these conceptual challenges through two contrasting empirical encounters with 3D printing technologies. In doing so, my intention is to lend an affective consistency to Simondon’s problematic, and to do so in a way that captures the kinds of material mutations expressive of a particular technological moment.}

As the number of sequences increases, the length of time taken to complete an MCMC analysis increases as well. Here, we investigate an approach to distribute the MCMC analysis across a cluster of computers. To do this, we use bootstrapped topologies as fixed genealogies, perform a single MCMC analysis on each genealogy without topological rearrangements, and pool the results across all MCMC analyses. We show, through simulations, that although the standard MCMC performs better than the bootstrap-MCMC at estimating the effective population size (scaled by mutation rate), the bootstrap-MCMC returns better estimates of growth rates. Additionally, we find that our bootstrap-MCMC analyses are, on average, 37 times faster for equivalent effective sample sizes.}

abstract = {This paper examines reports of empirical research on Feuerstein’s “Instrumental Enrichment” (FIE) as a method of teaching thinking skills and asks what can be concluded from these reports with respect to the following: (a) the nature and statistical reliability of observed FIE effects and, for those effects that are statistically reliable, (b) the “amount” of FIE that appears to be required for these effects to appear.}

abstract = {In this paper, steady, laminar, incompressible, and two-dimensional micropolar flow between a porous disk and a nonporous disk is considered. By introducing suitable similarity transformations, the problem is reduced to a set of nonlinear boundary value problems. Optimal homotopy asymptotic method is employed to obtain the series solutions for velocity and microrotation distribution. The accuracy of results is examined by the fourth-order Runge–Kutta numerical method. The results are presented to study the velocity and rotation profiles for different physical parameters such as: Reynolds number, vortex viscosity parameter, spin gradient viscosity, and microinertia density parameter. As a result, the magnitude of the injection velocity has strong influence on the flow velocities and the microrotation.}

abstract = {Understanding differences in the genetic architecture of complex traits between the two sexes has significant implications for evolutionary studies and clinical diagnosis. However, our knowledge about sex-specific genetic architecture is limited largely because of a lack of analytical models that can detect and quantify the effects of sex on the complexity of quantitative genetic variation. Here, we derived a statistical model for mapping DNA sequence variants that contribute to sex-specific differences in allele frequencies, linkage disequilibria, and additive and dominance genetic effects due to haplotype diversity. This model allows a genome-wide search for functional haplotypes and the estimation and test of haplotype by sex interactions and sex-specific heritability. The model, validated by simulation studies, was used to detect sex-specific functional haplotypes that encode a pain sensitivity trait in humans. The model could have important implications for mapping complex trait genes and studying the detailed genetic architecture of sex-specific differences.}

abstract = {Soft armour consisting of multi-layered high-performance fabrics are a popular choice for personal protection. Extensive work done in the last few decades suggests that shear thickening fluids improve the impact resistance of woven fabrics. Shear thickening fluid–impregnated fabrics have been proven as an ideal candidate for producing comfortable, high-performance soft body armour. However, the mechanism of defeating a projectile using a shear thickening fluid–impregnated multi-layered fabric is not fully understood and can be considered as a gap in the research done on the improvement of soft armour. Even though considerable progress has been achieved on dry fabrics, limited studies have been performed on shear thickening fluid–impregnated fabrics. The knowledge of simulation of multi-layered fabric armour is not well developed. The complexity in creating the geometry of the yarns, incorporating friction between yarns and initial pre-tension between yarns due to weaving patterns make the numerical modelling a complex process. In addition, the existing knowledge in this area is widely dispersed in the published literature and requires synthesis to enhance the development of shear thickening fluid–impregnated fabrics. Therefore, this article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the current methods of modelling shear thickening fluid–impregnated fabrics with a critical analysis of the techniques used. The review is preceded by an overview of shear thickening behaviour and related mechanisms, followed by a discussion of innovative approaches in numerical modelling of fabrics. A novel state-of-the-art means of modelling shear thickening fluid–impregnated fabrics is proposed in conclusion of the review of current methods. A short case study is also presented using the proposed approach of modelling.}
