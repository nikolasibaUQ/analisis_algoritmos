abstract = {This article sheds light on the emerging forms of cultural capital that media practitioners need to acquire to work with automated news, as in Bourdieu’s understanding of unique abilities that include, among others, journalistic expertise and technical know-how. To uncover these new skills, we carried out 30 interviews with editorial staff, executives and technologists working at 23 media organisations based in Europe, North America and Australia. We show that these new forms of cultural capital are essentially two-fold: on the one hand, they involve taking a “structured journalism” approach so as to think of what an ideal story may look like, and then by breaking it down into smaller predictable elements that can be reusable across many versions of that same story; on the other hand, they also call for knowing how to embed a media organisation’s standards and practices into code for automated news. Overall this study argues that a new type of cultural capital emerges, as it is associated with the production of automated news. We call it the distinct-abstract capital, whereby journalism is thought of both as a one-off endeavour and as a process that can be deconstructed in an abstract way close to computer programming.}

abstract = {Computational modeling holds significant promise as a tool for improving how theory is developed, expressed, and used to inform empirical research and evaluation efforts. However, the knowledge and skillsets needed to build computational models are rarely developed in the training received by social and organizational scientists. The purpose of this manuscript is to provide an accessible introduction to and reference for building computational models to represent theory. We first discuss important principles and recommendations for “thinking about” theory and developing explanatory accounts in ways that facilitate translating their core assumptions, specifications, and ideas into a computational model. Next, we address some frequently asked questions related to building computational models that introduce several fundamental tasks/concepts involved in building models to represent theory and demonstrate how they can be implemented in the R programming language to produce executable model code. The accompanying supplemental materials describes additional considerations relevant to building and using computational models, provides multiple examples of complete computational model code written in R, and an interactive application offering guided practice on key model-building tasks/concepts in R.}

It briefly describes the most popular of such programs and compares their key features, including the kinds of games that can be created with the software, the types of communities and resources that are associated with each program, claims made for learning outcomes resulting from use of the software, and the results of empirical research (if any) on the application and outcomes of the software in formal or informal educational settings. A key finding is that existing software and educational applications stress the goal of teaching users about computer programming and place little or no emphasis on teaching concepts related to game design. It concludes by discussing the potential value of explicit attention to “design thinking” as goal of game making in education.}

abstract = {Scientific knowledge, ideally neutral and impartial, is inevitably shaped by geographical, economic, and cultural contexts. This research contends that overcoming the constraints of human and economic scarcity, inertia, and limited funding access demands development of collaborative research networks. To this end, four university laboratories from Brazil and Chile - UFRJ, UBB, UTFSM and UAI - have united to advance robotics applied to architecture. The methodology begins with an analysis of Industry 4.0, Fab Lab implementations, and robotics in architecture in the region. They identify key research aspects by mapping each laboratory’s activities and technologies to pinpoint expertise and potential collaborative areas. The authors propose a summary table comparing the labs and a chronological overview to track regional robotics advancement. To raise awareness among peers, the initiative involves joint actions such as courses, workshops and technical visits.1 Recognising the scarcity of robotic units and the inapplicability of procedures from wealthier contexts, the authors draw on their lab experience to propose guidelines for implementing robotics research units in academia within the region. This includes technological alternatives, installation considerations, and detailed configuration reviews. The deployment of additional robotic units is a means to foster collaboration and bolster the network. Anticipated outcomes encompass increased critical mass, collaborative research initiatives, faculty and student exchange across institutions, higher publication rates, knowledge acquisition, and improved access to global funding agencies. In summary, the Southern Creative Robotics network initiative aims to catalyse the creative integration of digital manufacturing and robotics technology within design in the Ibero-American context.}

abstract = {Fostering students’ computer programming skills has become an important educational issue in the globe. However, it remains a challenge for students to understand those abstract concepts when learning computer programming, implying the need to provide instant learning diagnosis and feedback in computer programming activities. In this study, a Two-Tier Test-Based Programming Training (T3PT) approach was proposed. Accordingly, an online learning system was developed to provide students with precision feedback for guiding them to identify misconceptions of computer programming to improve their computer programming learning achievement. In order to examine the effects of the proposed approach, a learning system was developed and a quasi-experiment was conducted. Two classes of 99 eighth-grade students from Taiwan were divided into an experimental group and a control group. The students in the experimental group used the learning system based on the T3PT approach, while the control group used the conventional learning system. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach was significantly superior to the conventional programming learning approach in terms of students’ programming logic concepts, problem-solving awareness, technology acceptance, and satisfaction with the learning approach. Accordingly, discussion and suggestions are provided for future research.}

However, no a priori estimate of its value exists for use in initial design exercise of a hypersonic vehicle. In the present work, an air intake of a non-axisymmetric scramjet engine, designed using stream thrust methodology, is studied using computational fluid dynamic techniques. A large amount of air mass flow rate is observed to spill from the sides, which is not accounted for in the initial design phase. In absence of even an approximate estimate of this spillage, computational fluid dynamic studies become the only available tool to evaluate the mass capture ratio. Simulations are also carried out with a side wall at the intake to stop spillage. Although mass capture ratio and static pressure at combustor entry improve, deterioration in other flow parameters such as static temperature, Mach number and total pressure is observed.}

abstract = {Technology has become an integral part of teaching and learning, but there is still limited understanding of how it is utilized to support computing education in early childhood. To address this knowledge gap, this review investigated the current implementation of computing technologies in early childhood settings, the implementation of computing activities, the learning outcomes achieved by students, and the utilization of assessment strategies to evaluate student learning. Through a systematic review and synthesis of 31 empirical studies published between 2014 and 2020, this review identified: (1) Twenty-two computing technologies that feature three types of computing environments; (2) Eight types of learning activities to engage children in computing; (3) A variety of learning outcomes accomplished in cognitive and non-cognitive dimensions; (4) A wide range of assessment strategies to evaluate students’ outcomes in different dimensions. This review strengthened the evidence base for the benefits of teaching computing with technology to children, informed the design of age-appropriate computing technology and learning activities, and identified research gaps to inform future research. Implications were provided to inform the future design and delivery of computing instruction to early childhood learners.}

abstract = {The use of computational processes in architecture is a widespread practice which draws on a set of theories of computer science developed in the 60s and 70s. With the advent of computers, many of these methodologies were developed in research centres in the USA and the UK. Focussing on this period, this paper investigates the importance of the German Hochschule fur Gestaltung, Ulm (HfG) design school in the early stages of computation in design and architecture. Even though there were no computers in the school, it may be argued that its innovative pedagogy and distinguished faculty members launched analogical computational design methods that can be seen as the basis for further computational approaches in architecture. The paper draws on archive material, as well as at an original interview with Tomas Maldonado, to propose that the remarkable work pursued by Tomas Maldonado (the educational project), Max Bense (information aesthetics) and Horst Rittel (scientific methods) was fundamental in establishing HfG Ulm as the forerunner of computation in architecture.}

These questions are reflected in the frame of the recent discussion of human and machine learning. AI for learning provides many applications and multimodal channels for supporting people in cognitive and non-cognitive task domains. The articles in this special issue evidence that agency, engagement, self-efficacy, and collaboration are needed in learning and working with intelligent tools and environments. The importance of social elements is also clear in the articles. The articles also point out that the teacher’s role in digital pedagogy primarily involves facilitating and coaching. AI in learning has a high potential, but it also has many limitations. Many worries are linked with ethical issues, such as biases in algorithms, privacy, transparency, and data ownership. This special issue also highlights the concepts of explainability and explicability in the context of human learning. We need much more research and research-based discussion for making AI more trustworthy for users in learning environments and to prevent misconceptions.}

abstract = {As machines have become increasingly smart and have entangled human thinking with artificial intelligences, it seems no longer possible to distinguish among levels of decision-making that occur in the newly formed space between critical reasoning, logical inference and sheer calculation. Since the 1980s, computational systems of information processing have evolved to include not only deductive methods of decision, whereby results are already implicated in their premises, but have crucially shifted towards an adaptive practice of learning from data, an inductive method of retrieving information from the environment and establishing general premises. This shift in logical methods of decision-making does not simply concern technical apparatuses, but is a symptom of a transformation in logical thinking activated with and through machines. This article discusses the pioneering work of Katherine Hayles, whose study of the cybernetic and computational infrastructures of our culture particularly clarifies this epistemological transformation of thinking in relation to machines.}

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the computational experiment approach, learning styles, epistemic beliefs, and engagement with the inquiry process on the learning performance of pre-service engineering students. The study used the Felder-Silverman learning style model (FSLSM), in order to provide information for the relation of FSLSM with the learning environment in order to examine whether the strength of learning styles has an effect on the students’ learning performance in mismatched courses. Our objective was: a) to investigate whether students with a strong preference for a specific learning style have more difficulties in learning, if their learning style is not supported in the learning environment; b) if the methodology of the computational experiment has an impact on students independently of their learning style; and c) if the epistemological beliefs are related to different learning styles. The learning environment was based on the methodology of the computational experiment and applications were developed using the Easy Java Simulator software, while the inquiry based teaching and learning process was adopted. The questionnaire responses were gathered from 79 pre-service engineering students in a higher education institute in Greece. Results indicate that students with no preferred learning style have a better learning performance in mismatched courses.}

abstract = {Background/Context: Bi/multilingual students’ STEM learning is better supported when educators leverage their language and cultural practices as resources, but STEM subject divisions have been historically constructed based on oppressive, dominant values and exclude the ways of knowing of nondominant groups. Truly promoting equity requires expanding and transforming STEM disciplines. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This article contributes to efforts to illuminate emergent bi/multilingual students’ ways of knowing, languaging, and doing in STEM. We follow the development of syncretic literacies in relation to translanguaging practices, asking, How do knowledges and practices from different communities get combined and reorganized by students and teachers in service of new modeling practices? Setting and Participants: We focus on a seventh-grade science classroom, deliberately designed to support syncretic literacies and translanguaging practices, where computer science concepts were infused into the curriculum through modeling activities. The majority of the students in the bilingual program had arrived in the United States at most three years before enrolling, from the Caribbean and Central and South America. Research Design: We analyze one lesson that was part of a larger research–practice partnership focused on teaching computer science through leveraging translanguaging practices and syncretic literacies. The lesson was a modeling and computing activity codesigned by the teacher and two researchers about post–Hurricane María outmigration from Puerto Rico. Analysis used microethnographic methods to trace how students assembled translanguaging, social, and schooled practices to make sense of and construct models. Findings/Results: Findings show how students assembled representational forms from a variety of practices as part of accomplishing and negotiating both designed and emergent goals. These included sensemaking, constructing, explaining, justifying, and interpreting both the physical and computational models of migration. Conclusions/Recommendations: Implications support the development of theory and pedagogy that intentionally make space for students to engage in meaning-making through translanguaging and syncretic practices in order to provide new possibilities for lifting up STEM learning that may include, but is not constrained by, disciplinary learning. Additional implications for teacher education and student assessment practices call for reconceptualizing schooling beyond day-to-day curriculum as part of making an ontological shift away from prioritizing math, science, and CS disciplinary and language objectives as defined by and for schooling, and toward celebrating, supporting, and centering students’ diverse, syncretic knowledges and knowledge use.}

Training demands are thus arising for specific skills and competencies that would make current students and employment seekers more employable. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the twenty-first century’s major employability skills and competencies as well as the main demand trends for skills and competencies. METHODS: An international panel of experts (from Spain, Thailand and Poland), from both, academic and professional business backgrounds, were asked to quantitatively project the importance of different generic and specific skills and competencies over the next five years. They were asked to do so twice, once before and once after a four-year interval (in 2016 and in 2019). Each time, they were interviewed to discuss the results. RESULTS: The most valued employability skills were of a generic nature, in all three countries. Regarding specific skills, those of a social and managerial nature were the most highly valued. Work experience and formal education became less relevant for employability. CONCLUSIONS: The study’s results can lead to recommendations on how to design a more employability-oriented curriculum in educational institutions.}

abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics is taught in many universities and is a trending elective option among engineering students. Although analyzing computational fluid dynamics simulations is exciting enough, the theory is equation intensive, sometimes very abstract and also difficult to visualize for the novice. A creative thinking based approach termed synectics, which involves analogies, was therefore applied in classroom teaching to increase student comfort with the equations. For this purpose six analogies encompassing basic computational fluid dynamics concepts were developed along with pictorial representations, and are presented in this work. These analogies were integrated into classroom teaching via synectics procedures. Student feedback was positive and reflected higher engagement with the course compared to when the metaphoric activity was not implemented. This work attempts to demonstrate the feasibility and value of applying creative techniques, even when teaching a highly structured and equation oriented course such as computational fluid dynamics.}

abstract = {Whole number computations are a critical skill that serves as a foundation upon which higher-order concepts in mathematics are taught to children. To facilitate their instruction, educators often use multiple representations to support a child’s cognition. Representations with physical manipulatives are widely studied through a graduated instructional sequence featuring concrete, representational, and abstract stages of learning. In contrast, research on representational sequences featuring virtual manipulatives is less robust. Thus, this study evaluated an instructional strategy with virtual manipulatives, static representational drawings, and abstract algorithms to teach multiplication to three U.S. elementary students with mathematics difficulty. A functional relation was established via a single-subject multiple probe design between the treatment and students’ accuracy performance. Baseline-corrected Tau estimates confirmed a medium effect size for all three students, while student performance on measures assessing the number of errors committed and the duration of sessions also returned favorable findings.}

abstract = {Computational approaches to understanding the algorithms of the mind are just beginning to pervade the field of clinical psychology. In the present article, we seek to explain in simple terms why this approach is indispensable to pursuing explanations of psychological phenomena broadly, and we review nascent efforts to use this lens to understand anxiety. We conclude with future directions that will be required to advance algorithmic accounts of anxiety. Ultimately, the surplus explanatory value of computational models of anxiety, above and beyond existing neurobiological models of anxiety, impugns the naively reductionist claim that neurobiological models are sufficient to explain anxiety.}

abstract = {Computational methods have increased the objectivity of measures of human behavior and positioned personality science to benefit from the ongoing digital revolution. In this review, we define and discuss computational personality assessment (CPA), a measurement process that uses computational technologies to obtain estimates of personality. We briefly review some of the most promising sources of data currently used for CPA: mobile sensing, digital footprints from social media, images, language, and experience sampling. We present a concise overview of key findings, discuss the promise and opportunities of CPA (e.g., moving towards objective measures of personality, obtaining new insights from big data), and highlight important limitations and challenges in the development and application of CPA (e.g., establishing reliability and validity, selecting appropriate ground truth criterion, assessing affect and cognition, implications for ethics and privacy). We conclude with our perspective on how CPA could change our understanding of individual differences.}

abstract = {This article presents the design, construct validation, and reliability of a self-report instrument in Spanish that aims to characterize different types of strategies that students can use to learn computer programming. We provide a comprehensive overview of the identification of learning strategies in the existing literature, the design and development of preliminary questionnaire items, the refinement of item wording, and the examination of the internal structure and reliability of the final instrument. The construction of the items was based on the educational theory of Self-Regulated Learning. The final version of the questionnaire, called the Computer Programming Learning Strategies Questionnaire (CEAPC), was administered to 647 students enrolled in computer programming courses. The data collected from the participants were used to examine the construct validity and reliability of the questionnaire. The CEAPC consists of 13 subscales, each corresponding to a different type of learning strategy, and a total of 89 items. Statistical analyses of the data indicate that the CEAPC has adequate construct validity. In addition, the results of the internal consistency analysis indicate satisfactory reliability across the different subscales of the instrument. This study contributes to the field of educational research, particularly in the area of self-regulated learning in computer programming.}

abstract = {In higher education, it is challenging to cultivate non-computer science majors’ programming concepts. This study used the GAME model (gamification, assessment, modeling, and enquiry) in a programming education course to enhance undergraduates’ self-efficacy and performance of basic programming concepts. There were 83 undergraduates taking part in this study, which adopted a quasi-experimental research design. Students in the experimental group (n = 43) experienced a course in which the GAME model was used to design the block-based programming course. The control group (n = 40) was given a general information education course covering similar learning concepts without the game-based learning strategy. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was adopted to investigate the effect of the GAME model on students’ learning outcomes for the quantitative data. In the qualitative analysis, students’ responses to the course perception questionnaire were coded and analyzed. The results showed that students in the experimental group outperformed their counterparts regarding self-efficacy and basic programming concepts. The experimental treatment resulted in a small to medium effect size difference between the two groups. The results showed that incorporating the GAME model into block-based programming teaching helped improve undergraduates’ self-efficacy and performance of basic programming concepts. In addition, these experimental group undergraduates also perceived the pedagogic GAME model positively. Several research suggestions are proposed based on the findings of the present study.}

abstract = {An issue arising in emergency distance education procedures, such as the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, is a lack of appropriate high-quality content and course activities for high ability students suitable for distance education. In this study, online CAD-based learning experiences structured with the Tinkercad Circuits Platform designed for gifted students were investigated based on the opinions of students regarding the distance education activity and the evaluations of the students’ scientific writing skills. This study used a single case holistic design with 10 gifted 6th-grade students at Usak Science and Art Center in Türkiye. All of the students stated that they had not previously encountered an activity such as the “smart air conditioning system”. The students also stated that although the activity was carried out in the form of distance education, it was positive and fun to be application-based, and that it was fun to research, discuss, design, and code with Tinkercad to look for a solution to the given problem. The evaluation of students’ products showed participants’ high level of proficiency in activities requiring advanced problem-solving skills, including planning the solution to the problem, creating an alternative plan for the solution, realizing, and evaluating the design.}

abstract = {The computational aero-acoustic study of an isolated passenger car tire is carried out to understand the effect of dimensions of longitudinal tire grooves and operational parameters (velocity and temperature) on tire noise. The computational fluid dynamics and acoustic models are used to obtain aero-acoustic tire noise at near-field and far-field receivers around the tire and artificial neural networks-based regression are used to study the highly non-linear and interactive causal relationships in the system. Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes based realizable k-epsilon model is used to solve the flow field in the computational domain. The Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings model is used to obtain aero-acoustic tire noise at far-field positions. Spectral analysis is used to convert the output time domain to frequency domain and to obtain A-weighted sound pressure level. Artificial neural network–based response surface regression is conducted to understand casual relationships between A-weighted sound pressure level and control variables (Groove depth, Groove width, Temperature and velocity). Maximum A-weighted sound pressure level is observed in the wake region of the tire model. The interaction study indicates that ∼10% reduction in the aero-acoustic emissions is possible by selecting appropriate combinations of groove width and groove depth. The interaction of velocity with width is found to be most significant with respect to A-weighted sound pressure level at all receivers surrounding the tire. The interaction of operational parameters, that is, velocity and temperature are found to be significant with respect to A-weighted sound pressure level at wake and front receivers. Therefore, the regional speed limits and seasonal temperatures need to be considered while designing the tire to achieve minimum aero-acoustic emissions.}

abstract = {Uzbekistan has not adopted robotics education as the school curriculum yet. However, several robotics learning centers have introduced robotics education in an informal setting. This research paper aims to highlight the essence of robotics education in Uzbekistan investigating the perception of parents and children to their full potential and identifying impediments to the process of implementing robotics in Uzbekistan. This research study involves primary and secondary research methods. A systematic literature review was conducted to examine the reflection of robotics education among primary and secondary school children. Official statistical data was gathered to prove the scope of demographics. Primary data was collected through the survey among parents whose children attended robotics classes. Ultimately, the authors have used empirical evidence to provide recommendations and solutions on how to implement robotics education effectively in Uzbekistan. Much emphasis has not been put on robotics education in Uzbekistan, despite reforms in the field of STEM education. Moreover, the condition (including teachers, lesson materials, classrooms, computers, and robotics kits) to implement robotics classes as more developed countries are doing has not been created properly, which hampers the introduction of robotics at schools. In addition, the majority of parents are not fully aware of the authentic value of robotics education in children’s lives. Hence, Uzbek schools are lagging in the field of robotics.}
