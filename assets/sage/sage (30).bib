abstract = {This article proposes a methodological approach that integrates quantitative analysis into ethnographic studies of online communities. By considering traces of interactions in digital environments, it demonstrates the potential benefits of computational analysis in enhancing online ethnography. The application of quantitative methods, which may be unconventional in the field of ethnography, effectively complements qualitative understanding. Computational analysis of digital traces provides a valuable framework for observations within online ethnography. Through a case study of a Russian-speaking sociological online community, this article highlights the points where research questions intersect, fostering a dialogue between computational analysis of digital traces and online ethnography. It describes the implementation of methods such as content analysis, network analysis, and topic modeling, while also reflecting on their analytical capabilities within the context of online ethnography.}

With ByrdBot, listeners can compare simulated soundscapes of 1970, 2017, and 2065 to immediately, and viscerally, experience decades of past or projected future environmental change. The communication tactic of ByrdBot—what we call emergent sonification—is discussed as one that capitalizes on computational media to facilitate attunement to nonhuman voices and, subsequently, to offer an affective grasping of the impacts of such phenomena as habitat destruction and climate change on wildlife displacement and loss.}

abstract = {The social identity approach suggests that group prototypical individuals have greater influence over fellow group members. This effect has been well-studied offline. Here, we use a novel method of assessing prototypicality in naturally occurring data to test whether this effect can be replicated in online communities. In Study 1a (N = 53,049 Reddit users), we train a linguistic measure of prototypicality for two social groups: libertarians and entrepreneurs. We then validate this measure further to ensure it is not driven by demographics (Study 1b: N = 882) or local accommodation (Study 1c: N = 1,684 Silk Road users). In Study 2 (N = 8,259), we correlate this measure of prototypicality with social network indicators of social influence. In line with the social identity approach, individuals who are more prototypical generate more responses from others. Implications for testing sociopsychological theories with naturally occurring data using computational approaches are discussed.}

This study aims to maximize the load-carrying capacity and stiffness of air bearing, and minimize its volume flow rate by optimizing the geometrical parameters of restrictor. To facilitate the calculation of air bearing performance, a parametric computational fluid dynamics model is developed. Then, it is combined with multiobjective optimization genetic algorithm to search the Pareto optimal solutions. Furthermore, as a case study, the optimal design of an annular thrust air bearing is implemented. The stiffness of air bearing is improved 38.5%, the load-carrying capacity is improved 33.9%, and the volume flow rate is declined 19.6%, which are finally validated by experiments.

Using the metaphor of decomposition, successful collaboration between computer scientists and humanities scholars can be seen to require a reflexive scrutiny — a decomposition — of the disciplinary research processes that are involved, thus allowing crucial differences with respect to typical ways of posing research questions, the role of data, and the rhythm of the research process to be highlighted. It is argued that the currently popular expectation towards data as a self-identical organizational unit tends to downplay the role of decomposition as practice and process. A European cyberinfrastructure initiative that tries to respect the specificities of scholarly practice in the humanities is critically assessed, reflecting in particular on the inherent tension between ‘mutual shaping’ of digital tools and their users on the one hand, and the policy interest in efficient, functionalist design principles on the other.}

abstract = {This paper documents a computational approach to the design, fabrication, and assembly of customizable space structures built entirely out of flat-cut interlocking elements without the need of nodes, fasteners, cement, or glue. Following a Research by Design (RbD) methodology, we establish a framework comprising geometric and parametric modeling, structural analysis, and digital fabrication stages to examine the following research question: how might the modularity of a construction kit be combined with the plasticity of parametric descriptions to facilitate the design and fabrication of flat-cut space structures? We find that an adaptive joint design that resolves local deformations at the node and element levels can facilitate the construction of flat-cut space structures by making modular components responsive to local geometric, material, and mechanical demands. The research centers on the design and construction of an architecture-scale installation based on the Weaire-Phelan structure—an aperiodic space-filling geometric structure that approximates the geometry of foam—entirely out of flat-cut interlocking elements. Documenting the process in technical detail, as well as some limitations, the paper contributes to recent efforts to develop digital materials suitable for architectural applications. In addition, it contributes to extend the formal and architectural possibilities of flat-cut space structure design by facilitating “bottom-up” design explorations in concert with the structure’s tectonic resolution.}

abstract = {False positive findings are a growing problem in many research literatures. We argue that excessive false positives often stem from model uncertainty. There are many plausible ways of specifying a regression model, but researchers typically report only a few preferred estimates. This raises the concern that such research reveals only a small fraction of the possible results and may easily lead to nonrobust, false positive conclusions. It is often unclear how much the results are driven by model specification and how much the results would change if a different plausible model were used. Computational model robustness analysis addresses this challenge by estimating all possible models from a theoretically informed model space. We use large-scale random noise simulations to show (1) the problem of excess false positive errors under model uncertainty and (2) that computational robustness analysis can identify and eliminate false positives caused by model uncertainty. We also draw on a series of empirical applications to further illustrate issues of model uncertainty and estimate instability. Computational robustness analysis offers a method for relaxing modeling assumptions and improving the transparency of applied research.}

In addition, CBDTE avoids most objections that have been raised against cognitive theories of emotion. A remaining objection, that beliefs are not necessary for the emotions covered by CBDTE, is rejected as empirically unsupported.}

The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved using the extended MAC method and the compressible Euler equations are solved using the TVD MacCormack method. Most of the flow visualization methods are conventional. For vector fields, however, we introduce a particle tracing algorithm that is suitable for large amounts of numerical data.

abstract = {Theories are the core of any science, but many imprecisely stated theories in organizational and management science are hampering progress in the field. Computational modeling of existing theories can help address the issue. Computational models are a type of formal theory that are represented mathematically or by other formal logic and can be simulated, allowing theorists to assess whether the theory can explain the phenomena intended as well as make testable predictions. As an example of the process, Locke’s integrated model of work motivation is translated into static and dynamic computational models. Simulations of these models are compared to the empirical data used to develop and test the theory. For the static model, the simulations revealed largely strong associations with robust empirical findings. However, adding dynamics created several challenges to key precepts of the theory. Moreover, the effort revealed where empirical work is needed to further refine or refute the theory. Discussion focuses on the value of computational modeling as a method for formally testing, pruning, and extending extant theories in the field.}

Some scholars, however, have argued that violence is often the result of local cleavages and feuds, many of which may be unrelated to the conflict’s master cleavage. How is local violence related to the conflict’s master cleavage? Using a computational model, this paper studies an alliance mechanism proposed by Kalyvas (2006, The Logic of Violence in Civil War, Cambridge University Press), where macro-actors support local ones that fight on their behalf. While these alliances create a principal–agent problem, the model shows that they can raise the overall severity of the conflict and serve the interests of the macro-actor. However, the model also shows that these mechanisms work only under limited conditions. Alliances can increase the level of violence perpetrated in the interest of the macro-actor, but only if (a) the latter supports agents that have in the past fought along the master cleavage and if (b) this happens in rural areas. This emphasizes again the importance of the rural dimension in the study of civil war.}

abstract = {Increasing demands for high-performance screw pumps in oil and gas as well as other applications require deep understanding of the fluid flow field inside the machine. Important effects on the performance such as dynamic losses, influence of the leakage gaps and presence and extent of cavitation are difficult to observe by experiments. However, it is possible to study such effects using well-validated computational fluid dynamics models. The novel-structured numerical mesh consisting of a single-computational domain for moving screw pump rotors was developed to allow three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulation of such machine possible. Based on finite volume method, the instantaneous mass flow rates, rotor torque, local pressure field, velocity field and other performance indicators including the indicated power were predicted. A calculation model for the bearing friction losses was introduced to account for mechanical losses. The geometry of the inlet and outlet passages and piping system are taken into consideration to evaluate their influences on the pressure distribution and shaft power. The paper also shows the influence of rotor clearances on the pump performance. The computational fluid dynamics model was validated by comparing the numerical results with the measured performance obtained in the experimental test rig through the comprehensive experiment performed for a set of discharge pressures and rotational speeds. Validation includes comparison of mass flow rates, shaft power and efficiency under variety of speeds and discharge pressure. It has been found that the predicted results match well with the measurements. The results also showed that the radial clearances have larger influence on the mass flow rate than the interlobe clearance. The correct design of the flow passages within the screw pump plays significant role in minimizing required power consumption. The analysis presented in this paper contributes to better understanding of the working process inside the screw pump and offers a good reference to improve design and optimize such machines in terms of clearance selection, shape of the ports, piping system, etc. In future, this model will be used for analysis of cavitating flows and determining performance of other multiphase screw pumps.}

abstract = {In this study, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulation was adopted to evaluate the valve-induced water hammer phenomena in a typical tank-pipeline-valve-tank system. Meanwhile, one-dimensional analysis based on method of characteristics was also used for comparison and reference. As for the computational fluid dynamics model, the water hammer event was successfully simulated by using the sliding mesh technology and considering water compressibility. The key factors affecting simulation results were investigated in detail. It is found that the size of time step has an obvious effect on the attenuation of the wave and there exists a best time step. The obtained simulation results have a good agreement with the experimental data, which shows an unquestionable advantage over the method of characteristics calculation in predicting valve-induced water hammer. In addition, the computational fluid dynamics simulation can also provide a visualization of the pressure and flow evolutions during the transient process.}

abstract = {Molecular biology focuses on genes and their interactions at the transcription, regulation and protein level. Finding genes that cause certain behaviors can make therapeutic interventions more effective. Although biological tools can extract the genes and perform some analyses, without the help of computational methods, deep insight of the genetic function and its effects will not occur. On the other hand, complex systems can be modeled by networks, introducing the main data as nodes and the links in-between as the transactions occurring within the network. Gene regulatory networks are examples that are modeled and analyzed in order to gain insight of their exact functions. Since a cell’s specific functionality is greatly determined by the genes it expresses, translation or the act of converting mRNA to proteins is highly regulated by the control network that directs cellular activities. This paper briefly reviews the most important computational methods for analyzing, modeling and controlling the gene regulatory networks.}
