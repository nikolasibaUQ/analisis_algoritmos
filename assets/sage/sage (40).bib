abstract = {Atherosclerosis at the early stage in coronary arteries has been associated with low cycle-average wall shear stress magnitude. However, parallel to the identification of an established active role for low wall shear stress in the onset/progression of the atherosclerotic disease, a weak association between lesions localization and low/oscillatory wall shear stress has been observed. In the attempt to fully identify the wall shear stress phenotype triggering early atherosclerosis in coronary arteries, this exploratory study aims at enriching the characterization of wall shear stress emerging features combining correlation-based analysis and complex networks theory with computational hemodynamics. The final goal is the characterization of the spatiotemporal and topological heterogeneity of wall shear stress waveforms along the cardiac cycle. In detail, here time-histories of wall shear stress magnitude and wall shear stress projection along the main flow direction and orthogonal to it (a measure of wall shear stress multidirectionality) are analyzed in a representative dataset of 10 left anterior descending pig coronary artery computational hemodynamics models. Among the main findings, we report that the proposed analysis quantitatively demonstrates that the model-specific inlet flow-rate shapes wall shear stress time-histories. Moreover, it emerges that a combined effect of low wall shear stress magnitude and of the shape of the wall shear stress–based descriptors time-histories could trigger atherosclerosis at its earliest stage. The findings of this work suggest for new experiments to provide a clearer determination of the wall shear stress phenotype which is at the basis of the so-called arterial hemodynamic risk hypothesis in coronary arteries.}

The authors present how the integration of computerised morphological analysis with new computational models, incorporating web crawler, data processing networking and data mining algorithms, can help facilitate the identification of new ideas. Boden’s concept of ‘Combinational Creativity’ indicates a structured process, which generates unfamiliar combinations of familiar concepts and constructs allowing creative styles of thought. This structured approach has been constrained by the resultant combinatorial explosion and the dearth of easily accessible computer software and supporting methodologies, to help identify viable new solutions. Feature-enhanced computerised morphological analysis provides a new structural support tool for creativity and innovation. Morphological analysis systematically structures and examines all the possible relationships in a multidimensional, highly complex, usually non-quantifiable problem space. Computerisation of the process now permits large number of configurations (millions) in the problem space to be majorly reduced (typically > 95%), identifying only internally consistent solutions. These solutions are likely to embrace configurations containing something, which has not previously been considered, thus increasing the probability of some form of technological or design breakthrough and hence truly creative.}

abstract = {Abstract The optimization of thermal processes such as sterilization relies on the accuracy of relevant kinetic data for bacterial inactivation and quality evolution. It is also dependent on the geometry and heating mechanism involved in the process. In these processes or systems, profiles of temperature distribution, bacteria concentration and concentrations of vitamins C (ascorbic acid), B1 (thiamin) and B2 (riboflavin) in a can filled with cherry juice during thermal sterilization have been obtained through numerical simulations. Different heating medium temperatures of 121, 130 and 140°C were tested. In order to generate these profiles, the continuity, momentum and energy equations are solved numerically, together with those of bacteria and vitamins concentrations, using the computational fluid dynamics code PHOENICS, combined with reaction kinetics models. Natural convection that occurs during thermal sterilization of viscous liquid (concentrated cherry juice, 74 °Brix) in a cylindrical can heated from all sides has been studied in this work. The simulations show clearly the dependences of the concentration of live bacteria and different vitamins on both the temperature distribution and the flow pattern as sterilization proceeds. The results also show that the best sterilization temperature may not always be 121 °C, depending on the quality requirements imposed on individual food material of concern.}

Therefore, it is essential to ensure good indoor air quality that enhances health and benefits rest and recovery. In this context, it is necessary to achieve a balance between energy efficiency and air distribution parameters; thus, the influence exerted by the furniture of a bedroom on the air exchange efficiency, in the breathing zone during sleep, is assessed in this study. Computational fluid dynamics techniques, experimentally validated by the tracer gas (SF6) concentration decay method, are used to analyze 52 case studies corresponding to the same space, but varying both the number and the arrangement of the furniture inside. It is concluded that, in order to achieve a significant improvement in the air exchange efficiency, the number of elements included in the bedroom is not relevant, but the position of them. The highest increase in the ventilation efficiency in breathing zone is observed when the furniture is located avoiding the airflow obstruction in the area near the inlet and creating an unfilled volume of air in the area close to the outlet.}

abstract = {Application of computational fluid dynamics to real steam flows including non-equilibrium condensing flows requires an accurate and, at the same time, computationally inexpensive formulation of thermodynamic properties of steam. The present formulation enables fast computation of all thermodynamic properties, using mass density and specific internal energy as independent variables. This choice of independent variables follows the needs of time-marching computational fluid dynamics computations of dry and metastable steam flows in steam turbines. The formulation comprises an ideal-gas part and a residual part. The residual part is expressed in a form analogous to the virial equation of state but the coefficients are functions of internal energy, rather than temperature. Here we present a variant retaining only one coefficient of the density series, corresponding to the second virial coefficient. The uncertainties of properties computed from the present formulation only slightly exceed those of the fundamental formulation IAPWS-95. The formulation is valid from 253.15 K to 1073.15 K. Up to pressures given by the isentrope 7.5 kJ/(kg K), the computed properties are within the experimental uncertainties. Beyond this limit, the accuracy continuously decreases as it can be determined from presented deviation plots.}

Advances in imaging technologies are therefore essential to derive novel biological insights to better understand the complex workings of living systems. Recent high-throughput sequencing and imaging techniques are allowing researchers to simultaneously address complex molecular variations spatially and temporarily in tissues and organs. The availability of increasingly large dataset sizes has allowed for the evolution of robust deep learning models, designed to interrogate biomedical imaging data. These models are emerging as transformative tools in diagnostic medicine. Combined, these advances allow for dynamic, quantitative, and predictive observations of entire organisms and tissues. Here, we address 3 main tasks of bioimage analysis, image restoration, segmentation, and tracking and discuss new computational tools allowing for 3-dimensional spatial genomics maps. Finally, we demonstrate how these advances have been applied in studies of craniofacial development and oral disease pathogenesis.}

In a control condition, numeracy predicted probabilistic reasoning at high levels of both thinking dispositions and GA, and GA predicted nonprobabilistic reasoning at high levels of thinking dispositions. In a logic instruction condition, numeracy predicted probabilistic reasoning when GA was high, and GA affected nonprobabilistic reasoning directly. Thinking dispositions moderated neither relationship. Instead, instructions facilitated reasoning for low thinking disposition/high-ability participants, suggesting that logic instructions cued low thinking disposition individuals to engage in higher order reflective processing. The evidence is consistent with the proposals that reflective processes are essential to the allocation of algorithmic resources, and algorithmic resources are necessary for effective mindware implementation.}

abstract = {Jiedu Huoxue Decoction (JHD), a recommended traditional prescription for patients with severe COVID-19, has appeared in the treatment protocols in China. Based on bioinformatics and computational chemistry methods, including molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) calculation, we aimed to reveal the mechanism of JHD in treating severe COVID-19. The compounds in JHD were obtained and screened on TCMSP, SwissADME, and ADMETLab platforms. The compound targets were obtained from TCMSP and STITCH, while COVID-19 targets were obtained from Genecards and NCBI. The protein-protein interaction network was constructed by using STRING. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment were performed with ClueGO and R language. AutoDock vina was employed for molecular docking. 100 ns MD simulation of the optimal docking complex was carried out with AmberTools 20. A total of 84 compounds and 29 potential targets of JHD for COVID-19 were collected. The key phytochemicals included quercetin, luteolin, β-sitosterol, puerarin, stigmasterol, kaempferol, and wogonin, which could regulate the immune system. The hub genes included IL6, IL10, VEGFA, IL1B, CCL2, HMOX1, DPP4, and ACE2. ACE2 and DPP4 were related to SARS-CoV-2 entering cells. GO and KEGG analysis showed that JHD could intervene in cytokine storm and endothelial proliferation and migration related to thrombosis. The molecular docking, 100 ns MD simulation, and MM/GBSA calculation confirmed that targets enriched in the COVID-19 pathway had high affinities with related compounds, and the conformations of the puerarin-ACE2, quercetin-EGFR, luteolin-EGFR, and quercetin-IL1B complexes were stable. In a word, JHD could treat COVID-19 by intervening in cytokine storm, thrombosis, and the entry of SARS-CoV-2, while regulating the immune system. These mechanisms were consistent with JHD’s therapeutic concept of “detoxification” and “promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis” in treating COVID-19. The research provides a theoretical basis for the development and application of JHD.}

Memory and Cognition, 36(1), 201–216) presented evidence that the so-called ambiguity advantage [Traxler et al. (1998). Adjunct attachment is not a form of lexical ambiguity resolution. Journal of Memory and Language, 39(4), 558–592], which has been explained in terms of the Unrestricted Race Model, can equally well be explained by assuming underspecification in ambiguous conditions driven by task-demands. Specifically, if comprehension questions require that ambiguities be resolved, the parser tends to make an attachment: when questions are about superficial aspects of the target sentence, readers tend to pursue an underspecification strategy. It is reasonable to assume that individual differences in strategy will play a significant role in the application of such strategies, so that studying average behaviour may not be informative. In order to study the predictions of the good-enough processing theory, we implemented two versions of underspecification: the partial specification model (PSM), which is an implementation of the Swets et al. proposal, and a more parsimonious version, the non-specification model (NSM). We evaluate the relative fit of these two kinds of underspecification to Swets et al.’s data; as a baseline, we also fitted three models that assume no underspecification. We find that a model without underspecification provides a somewhat better fit than both underspecification models, while the NSM model provides a better fit than the PSM. We interpret the results as lack of unambiguous evidence in favour of underspecification; however, given that there is considerable existing evidence for good-enough processing in the literature, it is reasonable to assume that some underspecification might occur. Under this assumption, the results can be interpreted as tentative evidence for NSM over PSM. More generally, our work provides a method for choosing between models of real-time processes in sentence comprehension that make qualitative predictions about the relationship between several dependent variables. We believe that sentence processing research will greatly benefit from a wider use of such methods.}

abstract = {Background: There is increasing evidence from animal and clinical studies that network hyperexcitability (NH) may be an important pathophysiological process and potential target for treatment in early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Measures of functional connectivity (FC) have been proposed as promising biomarkers for NH, but it is unknown which measure has the highest sensitivity for early-stage changes in the excitation/inhibition balance. Objective: We aim to test the performance of different FC measures in detecting NH at the earliest stage using a computational approach. Methods: We use a whole brain computational model of activity dependent degeneration to simulate progressive AD pathology and NH. We investigate if and at what stage four measures of FC (amplitude envelope correlation corrected [AECc], phase lag index [PLI], joint permutation entropy [JPE] and a new measure: phase lag time [PLT]) can detect early-stage AD pathophysiology. Results: The activity dependent degeneration model replicates spectral changes in line with clinical data and demonstrates increasing NH. Compared to relative theta power as a gold standard the AECc and PLI are shown to be less sensitive in detecting early-stage NH and AD-related neurophysiological abnormalities, while the JPE and the PLT show more sensitivity with excellent test characteristics. Conclusions: Novel FC measures, which are better in detecting rapid fluctuations in neural activity and connectivity, may be superior to well-known measures such as the AECc and PLI in detecting early phase neurophysiological abnormalities and in particular NH in AD. These markers could improve early diagnosis and treatment target identification.}

abstract = {With regard to road safety issues, a deep understanding of the driver as a logic system is crucial to predict the most probable behavior according to the contextual elements. Knowledge and data about human functional abilities exist. But the problem is to organize and structure them. The development of a computational approach in driver modelization is addressed. In the first part, a brief historical overview is presented of available driver models in ergonomics and psychological areas, and the distinction between predictive and explicative models in an implementation perspective is the focus. In the second part, the computational aspect of the work is described, along with the software concepts, the cognitive modeling needs, and the implementation choices. Object-oriented techniques were chosen because they provide a modular overview of the general system and offer a convenient representation of cognitive processes. Object-oriented formalism, in particular object modeling technique diagrams, acts as a bridge between the two domains of computer science and the human sciences. The objective is to determine whether it is possible to implement reliably a driver model using the techniques from artificial intelligence and based on the theoretical knowledge from cognitive sciences research. This attempt to establish links between different scientific domains, requiring a common tool, is a challenge. A first step of a work that will have to be developed in a long-term time scale, taking into account its quite ambitious objective, is described.}

abstract = {Aim In current rotary blood pumps, complications related to blood trauma due to shear stresses are still frequently observed clinically. Reducing the rotor tip speed might decrease blood trauma. Therefore, the aim of this project was to design a two-stage rotary blood pump leading to lower shear stresses. Methods Using the principles of centrifugal pumps, two diagonal rotor stages were designed with an outer diameter of 22 mm. The first stage begins with a flow straightener and terminates with a diffusor, while a volute casing behind the second stage is utilized to guide fluid to the outlet. Both stages are combined into one rotating part which is pivoted by cup-socket ruby bearings. Details of the flow field were analyzed employing computational fluid dynamics (CFD). A functional model of the pump was fabricated and the pressure-flow dependency was experimentally assessed. Results Measured pressure-flow performance of the developed pump indicated its ability to generate adequate pressure heads and flows with characteristic curves similar to centrifugal pumps. According to the CFD results, a pressure of 70 mmHg was produced at a flow rate of 5 L/min and a rotational speed of 3200 rpm. Circumferential velocities could be reduced to 3.7 m/s as compared to 6.2 m/s in a clinically used axial rotary blood pump. Flow fields were smooth with well-distributed pressure fields and comparatively few recirculation or vortices. Substantially smaller volumes were exposed to high shear stresses >150 Pa. Conclusions Hence, blood trauma might be reduced with this design. Based on these encouraging results, future in vitro investigations to investigate actual blood damage are intended.}

abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses have become a frequent platform for learners to acquire knowledge. This study aims to explore multiple factors influencing learner retention in MOOCs during the COVID-19 pandemic. To address this, we collected quantitative and qualitative data from questionnaires and qualitative data from interviews and then analyzed them through the Partial Least Square–Structural Equation Modeling to test 14 research hypotheses. The proposed research model and research hypotheses are empirically tested with 243 participants across the world. According to the results, support is found for all of the 14 research hypotheses. We confirmed 14 factors influencing learner retention in MOOCs. The result is beneficial for designers and manufacturers of MOOCs to improve the quality of the products and facilitate online or blended learning during this special time. It could also help students improve their learning experiences. Future research could examine influencing factors of learner retention in MOOCs with interdisciplinary cooperation.}
