abstract = {In this paper we discuss the sound absorption property of arrays of micro-acoustic actuators at a control surface. We use the wave equation over the half plane for the velocity potential with a boundary dissipation by a proportional pressure feedback law along the half plane boundary. The feedback gain over the array is described by a distributed shape function. We develop a computational method based on the Fourier transform and employ it for analyzing and evaluating the decay rate of acoustic energy. Specifically, we carry out computations for a diffusive random initial field and report on our resulting numerical findings.}

abstract = {Background Past studies reported a low correlation between rhinomanometry and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but the source of the discrepancy was unclear. Low correlation or lack of correlation has also been reported between subjective and objective measures of nasal patency. Objective: This study investigates (1) the correlation and agreement between nasal resistance derived from CFD (RCFD) and rhinomanometry (RRMN), and (2) the correlation between objective and subjective measures of nasal patency. Methods Twenty-five patients with nasal obstruction underwent anterior rhinomanometry before and after mucosal decongestion with oxymetazoline. Subjective nasal patency was assessed with a 0-10 visual analog scale (VAS). CFD simulations were performed based on computed tomography scans obtained after mucosal decongestion. To validate the CFD methods, nasal resistance was measured in vitro (REXPERIMENT) by performing pressure-flow experiments in anatomically accurate plastic nasal replicas from 6 individuals. Results Mucosal decongestion was associated with a reduction in bilateral nasal resistance (0.34 ± 0.23 Pa.s/ml to 0.19 ± 0.24 Pa.s/ml, p = 0.003) and improved sensation of nasal airflow (bilateral VAS decreased from 5.2 ± 1.9 to 2.6 ± 1.9, p < 0.001). A statistically significant correlation was found between VAS in the most obstructed cavity and unilateral airflow before and after mucosal decongestion (r = −0.42, p = 0.003). Excellent correlation was found between RCFD and REXPERIMENT (r = 0.96, p < 0.001) with good agreement between the numerical and in vitro values (RCFD/REXPERIMENT = 0.93 ± 0.08). A weak correlation was found between RCFD and RRMN (r = 0.41, p = 0.003) with CFD underpredicting nasal resistance derived from rhinomanometry (RCFD/RRMN = 0.65 ± 0.63). A stronger correlation was found when unilateral airflow at a pressure drop of 75 Pa was used to compare CFD with rhinomanometry (r = 0.76, p < 0.001). Conclusion CFD and rhinomanometry are moderately correlated, but CFD underpredicts nasal resistance measured in vivo due in part to the assumption of rigid nasal walls. Our results confirm previous reports that subjective nasal patency correlates better with unilateral than with bilateral measurements and in the context of an intervention.}

abstract = {The increasing availability of data, along with sophisticated computational methods for analyzing them, presents researchers with new opportunities and challenges. In this article, we address both by describing computational and network methods that can be used to identify cases of rare phenomena. We evaluate each method’s relative utility in the identification of a specific rare phenomenon of interest to social movement researchers: the spillover of social movement claims from one movement to another. We identify and test five different approaches to detecting cases of spillover in the largest data set of protest events currently available, finding that an ensemble approach that combines clique and correspondence analysis and an ensemble approach combining all methods perform considerably better than others. Our approach is preferable to other ways of analyzing such cases; compared to qualitative approaches, our computational process identifies many more cases of spillover—some of which are surprising and would likely not be otherwise investigated. At the same time, compared to crude quantitative measures, our approach substantially reduces the “noise,” or identification of false-positive cases, of movement spillover. We argue that this technique, which can be adapted to other research topics, is a good illustration of how the thoughtful implementation of computational methods can allow for the efficient identification of rare events and also bridge deductive and inductive approaches to scientific inquiry.}

abstract = {The application of a previously developed computational method to the prediction of high-lift performance for multi-element aerofoil sections operating at transonic flow conditions is described. The flows are computed by solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, using a full differential Reynolds-stress turbulence model to evaluate the various Reynolds-stress components appearing in the governing mean-flow equations. Algebraic wall functions are used to bridge the molecular viscosity-dominated region immediately adjacent to the aerofoil surfaces. An unstructured grid-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology is used to deal with the geometric complexity of the multi-element aerofoil configurations. Initial results are presented for the viscous, transonic flow development around the SKF 1.1 supercritical aerofoil section, equipped with either a trailing-edge flap or a leading-edge slat. Predicted surface pressure distributions generally compare well with experimental data for the two high-lift aerofoil geometries considered, at a free-stream Mach number of 0.6 and over a range of incidence angles. There are some discrepancies in the regions immediately downstream of shock wave/boundary layer interactions, possibly resulting from the use of wall-function boundary conditions in the computations. Predicted Mach number contours indicate the complexity of the transonic flow fields for high-lift configurations, with the slat wake passing through an extensive supersonic-flow region, terminated by a normal shock wave, on the main aerofoil upper surface, for example.}

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most important diagnostic tools in modern medicine. Since it is a high-cost and highly-complex imaging modality, computational models are frequently built to enhance its understanding as well as to support further development. However, such models often have to be simplified to complete simulations in a reasonable time. Thus, the simulations with high spatial/temporal resolutions, with any motion consideration (like blood flow) and/or with 3D objects usually call for using parallel computing environments. In this paper, we propose to use graphics processing units (GPUs) for fast simulations of MRI of vascular structures. We apply a CUDA environment which supports general purpose computation on GPU (GPGPU). The data decomposition strategy is applied and thus the parts of each virtual object are spread over the GPU cores. The GPU cores are responsible for calculating the influence of blood flow behavior and MRI events after successive time steps. In the proposed approach, different data layouts, memory access patterns, and other memory improvements are applied to efficiently exploit GPU resources. Computational performance is thoroughly validated for various vascular structures and different NVIDIA GPUs. Results show that MRI simulations can be accelerated significantly thanks to GPGPU. The proposed GPU-based approach may be easily adopted in the modeling of other flow related phenomena like perfusion, diffusion or transport of contrast agents.}

abstract = {Abstract This paper describes the flow analysis in a centrifugal compressor stage using a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) algorithm. The flow unsteadiness arising from the interaction between the impeller and the diffuser has also been analysed using an algorithm suitable for equal or multiple numbers of rotor and diffuser blades. The multi-block, structured grid CFD code TASCflow which provides an approximate solution to the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations was used as a basis and algorithm development was undertaken to provide the required capability of modelling the unsteady interactions of the impeller and the diffuser. The centrifugal compressor stage under investigation consists of 28 radial blades (of which 14 are splitter blades) in the impeller and 27 vanes in the diffuser. The presented results and analysis are for off-design flow conditions where experimental results were available for comparison. The results obtained for the steady-state model show a reasonable agreement with the measurements. In general the unsteady flow field obtained shows a reasonable agreement with experimental data and exhibits considerable differences when compared with the steady-state results.}

DIANA is an end-to-end model, including an activation and decision component that takes the acoustic signal as input, activates internal word representations, and outputs lexicality judgments and estimated response latencies. Simulation 1 presents the process of creating acoustic models required by DIANA to analyze novel speech input. Simulation 2 investigates DIANA’s performance in determining whether the input signal is a word present in the lexicon or a pseudoword. In Simulation 3, we generate estimates of response latency and correlate them with general tendencies in participant responses in MALD data. We find that DIANA performs fairly well in free word recognition and lexical decision. However, the current approach for estimating response latency provides estimates opposite to those found in behavioral data. We discuss these findings and offer suggestions as to what a contemporary model of spoken word recognition should be able to do.}

Students’ error-related behaviors were also analyzed, and their relationships to success in introductory programming were investigated. This study identified 15 common compilation errors and 6 common test errors. The results showed that these common errors accounted for a large proportion of all errors, so identifying the common errors is important to help students succeed in introductory programming courses. Based on these common errors, five underlying student difficulties were identified and are discussed. In addition, after analyzing existing measures of students’ error-related behaviors, we developed a measure called improvement rate to quantify students’ success in fixing errors. The results of our study suggest that students’ competence of improving code is important to their success in introductory programming. We recommend researchers design and develop automated assessment tools that provide feedback messages for common student errors and instructors who explicitly teach knowledge and skills of improving code in class.}

The aim of this study was to identify the common residues among these neurotoxins by computational methods, and establish whether there is a pattern useful for the future generation of a treatment for autoimmune diseases. Our results showed eight new key common residues between the studied neurotoxins interacting with a histidine ring and the selectivity filter of the receptor, thus showing a possible pattern of interaction.

abstract = {Metacognition supports reflection upon and control of other cognitive processes. Despite metacognition occupying a central role in human psychology, its neural substrates remain underdetermined, partly due to study-specific differences in task domain and type of metacognitive judgement under study. It is also unclear how metacognition relates to other apparently similar abilities that depend on recursive thought such as theory of mind or mentalising. Now that neuroimaging studies of metacognition are more prevalent, we have an opportunity to characterise consistencies in neural substrates identified across different analysis types and domains. Here we used quantitative activation likelihood estimation methods to synthesise findings from 47 neuroimaging studies on metacognition, divided into categories based on the target of metacognitive evaluation (memory and decision-making), analysis type (judgement-related activation, confidence-related activation, and predictors of metacognitive sensitivity), and, for metamemory judgements, temporal focus (prospective and retrospective). A domain-general network, including medial and lateral prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and insula was associated with the level of confidence in self-performance in both decision-making and memory tasks. We found preferential engagement of right anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in metadecision experiments and bilateral parahippocampal cortex in metamemory experiments. Results on metacognitive sensitivity were inconclusive, likely due to fewer studies reporting this contrast. Finally, by comparing our results to meta-analyses of mentalising, we obtain evidence for common engagement of the ventromedial and anterior dorsomedial prefrontal cortex in both metacognition and mentalising, suggesting that these regions may support second-order representations for thinking about the thoughts of oneself and others.}

Submerged arc electric furnace smelting using the manganese-rich slag method is widely used to produce ferromanganese. This process has been modelled using the HSC computational thermodynamics package. It was assumed that higher manganese and iron oxides are reduced to MnO and FeO before entering the zone where molten slag and alloy form and equilibrate. The model predictions were compared to data from Thermit Alloys (P) Limited, an Indian ferroalloy smelter, and the agreement was found to be good. It was then used to examine the affects of changing the amount of carbon reductant and temperature on several performance indicators. The results of this modelling are discussed and it is concluded that the model is useful as an aid to understanding ferromanganese smelting.}

abstract = {To design a comfortable aircraft cabin environment, designers conventionally follow an iterative guess-and-correction procedure to determine the air-supply parameters. The conventional method has an extremely low efficiency but does not guarantee an optimal design. This investigation proposed an inverse design method based on a proper orthogonal decomposition of the thermo-flow data provided by full computational fluid dynamics simulations. The orthogonal spatial modes of the thermo-flow fields and corresponding coefficients were firstly extracted. Then, a thermo-flow field was expressed into a linear combination of the spatial modes with their coefficients. The coefficients for each spatial mode are functions of air-supply parameters, which can be interpolated. With a quick map of the cause–effect relationship between the air-supply parameters and the exhibited thermo-flow fields, the optimal air-supply parameters were determined from specific design targets. By setting the percentage of dissatisfied and the predicted mean vote as design targets, the proposed method was implemented for inverse determination of air-supply parameters in two aircraft cabins. The results show that the inverse design using computational fluid dynamics-based proper orthogonal decomposition method is viable. Most of computing time lies in the construction of data samples of thermo-flow fields, while the proper orthogonal decomposition analysis and data interpolation is efficient.}

abstract = {Since its inception, computational social science (CSS) has been characterized as an interdisciplinary field. Nevertheless, unlike a mature interdisciplinary field that duly integrates knowledge beyond disciplinary boundaries, CSS has arguably been fragmented into multiple lines of inquiry. Although such fragmentation has been a constant concern, limited empirical evidence exists to substantiate any degree of integration in research on CSS. To systematically map the landscape of research on CSS, we examined the dynamic topology of the bibliometric network of CSS during the past 20 years. By comparing the structure of the coupling network and the co-subject network with three prototypical network models that we simulated—the centralized model, the fragmented model, and the cohesive model—our analysis revealed that the citation networks of research on CSS are highly centralized but less fragmented than often assumed. Beyond that, a driving factor shaping the coupling network’s cohesive structure is the citation to high-impact articles. Those and other findings contribute to current understandings of the process of integration in the evolution of disciplines.}

abstract = {This paper reports our research concerning dialogue strategies suitable for adoption by a human–computer debating system. We propose a set of strategic heuristics for a computer to adopt to enable it to function as a dialogue participant. In particular, we consider means of assessing the proposed strategy. A system involving two agents in dialogue with each other and a human–agent debate system are constructed and subsequently used to facilitate the evaluations. The evaluations suggest that the proposed strategy can enable the computer to act as an effective dialogue participant. It is anticipated that this work will contribute towards the development of computerised dialogue systems and help to illuminate research issues concerning strategies in dialectical systems.}

abstract = {The primary objective of this investigation is to develop efficient and robust computational schemes for a damage-coupled cyclic thermoviscoplasticity model for solder materials. Three constitutive integration algorithms, Euler, modified Euler, and semi-implicit algorithm for the model are examined. The three algorithms for the model are coded in the commercial finite element (FE) code ABAQUS (version 6.21) via its user-defined material subroutine UMAT. Two single-step algorithms of the substep scheme are applied for the modified Euler algorithm to control the error in the integration of constitutive laws. A semi-empirical formulation is established for an adaptive time stepping algorithm that is based on the Euler algorithm. The simulations of single-element, miniature specimen and notched specimen simulations have been conducted and compared with the test results under monotonic tensile, creep, and fatigue tests of 63Sn-37Pb solder. It is observed that the explicit algorithm consistently requires much less CPU time than others. The modified Euler algorithm has shown, on the other hand, to be not only efficient but also accurate. The semi-implicit algorithm yields an accurate solution. It is worth noting that the method is also effective by applying an appropriate integration scheme.}
