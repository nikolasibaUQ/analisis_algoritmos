abstract = {Drawing from network theory and previous findings from US-based analyses, we measure the structure and interconnectedness of climate contrarian think tanks in Europe. This exploratory analysis can illustrate European organizations’ capacity to promote or disrupt political discourse. To this end, we use social network analysis to conduct actor-focused research. We identify the individuals bridging European think tanks, as well as their ties with the US climate change contrarian network. Our analysis reveals a discernible network structure for European climate change contrarian think tanks, with a profile connected to neoliberal organizations, including a few, but highly relevant links, with the US countermovement. We also find that the European think tanks’ institutional structure is very much shaped by a strong predominance of men, which aligns with previous research on masculinity and climate contrarianism.}

abstract = {Backgrounds Hemodynamics plays an important role in the natural history of the process of rupture and recurrence of intracranial aneurysms. This study aimed to investigate the role of hemodynamics for recurrence in a vertebral artery dissecting aneurysm (VADA). Methods A patient with a ruptured VADA firstly treated by low-profile visualized intraluminal support (LVIS)-assisted coiling, and was implanted with a Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) after aneurysm recurrence. Finite element analysis and computational fluid dynamics simulations were conducted in 6 serial imaging procedures, and the calculated hemodynamics was correlated with aneurysm recurrence. Results Wall shear stress (WSS) was not effectively suppressed, resulting in aneurysm recurrence with initial entry tear to occur above the protuberance after 7 months of LVIS stent-assisted coiling. With the implantation of PED, WSS, inflow stream and velocity at the aneurysm neck significantly decreased. During the 3-month follow-up after PED deployment, there was significant shrinkage of the sac and the blood flow in the sac was reduced considerably. The 27-month follow-up after PED deployment indicated the aneurysm was stable. Conclusions The present case study suggests that insufficient suppression of high WSS and high inflow velocity at the neck of the parent artery, especially near the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, might be associated with aneurysm recurrence.}

abstract = {Heightened risk taking in adolescence has long been attributed to valuation systems overwhelming the deployment of cognitive control. However, this explanation of why adolescents engage in risk taking is insufficient given increasing evidence that risk-taking behavior can be strategic and involve elevated cognitive control. We argue that applying the expected-value-of-control computational model to adolescent risk taking can clarify under what conditions control is elevated or diminished during risky decision-making. Through this lens, we review research examining when adolescent risk taking might be due to—rather than a failure of—effective cognitive control and suggest compelling ways to test such hypotheses. This effort can resolve when risk taking arises from an immaturity of the control system itself, as opposed to arising from differences in what adolescents value relative to adults. It can also identify promising avenues for channeling cognitive control toward adaptive outcomes in adolescence.}

abstract = {Digital engineering transformation is a crucial process for the engineering paradigm shifts in the fourth industrial revolution (4IR), and artificial intelligence (AI) is a critical enabling technology in digital engineering transformation. This article discusses the following research questions: What are the fundamental changes in the 4IR? More specifically, what are the fundamental changes in engineering? What is digital engineering? What are the main uncertainties there? What is trustworthy AI? Why is it important today? What are emerging engineering paradigm shifts in the 4IR? What is the relationship between the data-intensive paradigm and digital engineering transformation? What should we do for digitalization? From investigating the pattern of industrial revolutions, this article argues that ubiquitous machine intelligence (uMI) is the defining power brought by the 4IR. Digitalization is a condition to leverage ubiquitous machine intelligence. Digital engineering transformation towards Industry 4.0 has three essential building blocks: digitalization of engineering, leveraging ubiquitous machine intelligence, and building digital trust and security. The engineering design community at large is facing an excellent opportunity to bring the new capabilities of ubiquitous machine intelligence, and trustworthy AI principles, as well as digital trust, together in various engineering systems design to ensure the trustworthiness of systems in Industry 4.0.}

Poor choices have negative consequences in the moment and make it very hard to navigate complex social environments. Computational neuroscience provides normative, neurobiologically informed descriptions of the components of decision making that serve as a platform for a principled exploration of dysfunctions. Here, we identify and discuss three classes of failure modes arising in these formalisms. They stem from abnormalities in the framing of problems or tasks, from the mechanisms of cognition used to solve the tasks, or from the historical data available from the environment.}

The contribution of the research concerns methods to map influence and sensitivity that provide valuable and complementary information on space for decision making in territorial planning. We also discuss the center properties according to the primary objectives of equity, equality, and efficacy in the access to a facility. In a spatial-thinking approach, we present some methodological propositions to obtain robust and durable centers in geographical space, that rely on the adaptation of the general frame of the Lp norm to the planning objectives.}

Applying a correlated and hierarchical effect model of robust variance estimation, we examined the intervention effects among 15 peer-reviewed articles and dissertations (two group-design and 13 single-case design studies) published between 1989 and 2021. Whole number computation interventions demonstrated a statistically significant and large effect on whole number computation outcomes ( = 3.74). The type of mathematical operations, type of whole number computation measures, and the number of instructional components did not significantly affect the magnitude of the effect size estimate. However, the results showed slightly larger average effect sizes for the addition problem, the accuracy measure, and the additional number of instructional components by one. The limitations and implications for the practice of the meta-analysis are discussed, and future research directions are proposed.}

abstract = {From partial differential equations to the convolutional neural networks in deep learning, to matrix operations in dense linear algebra, computations on structured grids dominate high-performance computing and machine learning. The performance of such computations is key to effective utilization of the billions of US dollar’s worth of GPU-accelerated systems such computations are run on. Concurrently, the end of Moore’s law and Dennard scaling are driving the specialization of compute and memory architectures. This specialization often makes performance brittle (small changes in function can have severe ramifications on performance), non-portable (vendors are increasingly motivated to develop their programming models tailored for their specialized architectures), and not performance portable (even a given computation may perform very differently from one architecture to the next). The mismatch between computations that reference data that is logically neighboring in N-dimensional space but physically distant in memory motivated the creation of Bricks — a novel data-structure transformation for multi-dimensional structured grids that reorders data into small, fixed-sized bricks of contiguously-packed data. Whereas a cache-line naturally captures spatial locality in only one dimension of a structured grid, Bricks can capture spatial locality in three or more dimensions. When coupled with a Python interface, a code-generator, and autotuning, the resultant BrickLib software provides not only raw performance, but also performance portability across multiple CPUs and GPUs, scalability in distributed memory, user productivity, and generality across computational domains. In this paper, we provide an overview of BrickLib and provide a series of vignettes on how it delivers on the aforementioned metrics.}

abstract = {Drawing upon the growing datafication of contemporary schooling, our purpose in this article is to use topological thinking as an analytical device to better understand the professionals and practices within emergent data infrastructures. We address this by attending to an influential national (and subnational) data infrastructure of school monitoring in the United States, managed by the federal Department of Education, known as EDFacts. Informed by policy documents relating to EDFacts, as well as by various related software platforms and portals, we explore the whom and how of datafication, and expose the increasing presence and influence of otherwise ‘hidden’ technology mediators, or ‘shadow professionals’. In particular, we argue that the increasing dependency of EDFacts on data has necessitated the introduction of new professional roles associated with optimising the flow of data, and thus stabilising and normalising the topological space of the infrastructure. We conclude by suggesting that EDFacts encourages teaching professionals and shadow professionals alike to engage in acts of data submission; that is, providing data to EDFacts and, at the same time, positioning themselves as wholly responsive to the infrastructure and its datafied renderings of schooling.}

The NeuroData Tracker platform has been developed for the objective and precise evaluation of hand motor deficits. We describe the design and development of the platform and analyse the technological feasibility and usability in a relevant clinical setting. Methods A software application was developed in Unity (C#) to obtain kinematic data from hand movement tracking by a portable device with two cameras and three infrared sensors (leap motion®). Four exercises were implemented: (a) wrist flexion-extension (b) finger-grip opening-closing (c) finger spread (d) fist opening-closing. The most representative kinematic parameters were selected for each exercise. A script in Python was integrated in the platform to transform real-time kinematic data into relevant information for the clinician. The application was tested in a pilot study comparing the data provided by the tool from ten healthy subjects without any motor impairment and ten patients diagnosed with a stroke with mild to moderate hand motor deficit. Results The NeuroData Tracker allowed the parameterization of kinematics of hand movement and the issuance of a report with the results. The comparison of the data obtained suggests the feasibility of the tool for detecting differences between patients and healthy subjects. Conclusions This new platform based on optical motion capturing provides objective measurement of hand movement allowing quantification of motor deficits. These findings require further validation of the tool in larger trials to verify its usefulness in the clinical setting.}

abstract = {Massive anti-government protests erupted during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. The crisis activated a potential for resistance that has been simmering under the impositions of late-modern knowledge society. Made salient by the pandemic conditions of sudden extreme reliance on scientific (non) knowledge, the corona protestors activated this potential for resistance and constructed their own counter-knowledge order bound by shared resentment of and distrust in the established order and facilitated by digital platforms. Utilising social network analysis and structural topic modeling for digital critical discourse analysis, in this paper I explore how the corona protest counter-knowledge order is constructed with a particular focus on its contexts, roles, and hierarchies. I find that far-right and conspiracy imaginations are used to level out hierarchies and detach epistemic roles from their contexts to reinstate a superior self into interpretative power. The counter-knowledge order’s inherent construction of unwarranted omnipotence points to a more fundamental resistance to the established normative orders of our society that should be addressed more effectively if we want to be prepared for future crises and not lose common ground for making sense of them.}

After citing concerns expressed by psychologists and others regarding computationalism, the paper considers four entailments of the compost heap analogy that may serve, very roughly, as counterparts to such concepts as encoding, storage, and retrieval. They are: laying it on, breaking it down, stirring it up, and mixing it in. The paper concludes with reflections on the advantages of a more organic model of memory and some suggestions for further inquiry concerning issues of interest to the psychology of aging.}

abstract = {In order to satisfy emission standards and CO2 targets, spark-ignition engines are designed to operate with high dilution rates, compression ratios and boost levels, thus increasing the propensity for unstable combustion. Therefore it is important to address cycle-to-cycle variability (CCV) in complete engine simulators in order to support the design of viable architectures and control strategies. This work concerns the development, validation and application to a multi-cylinder spark-ignition engine of a physics-based one-dimensional combustion model able to render CCV. Its basis relies on the analysis of Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) of flow in a single-cylinder engine used to extract information relating physics to cyclic fluctuations. A one-dimensional CCV model is derived, accounting for variability related to in-cylinder aerodynamics, turbulence and mixture composition. A detailed spark-ignition model is developed, and the resulting model captures the strongly non-linear interactions between flow and combustion, starting from spark ignition and covering laminar/turbulent transition and wrinkling of the flame surface. A first validation is presented against dedicated experimental data from a single-cylinder engine. Detailed comparisons between measurements and predictions are reported on a set of parametric variations around a reference point to assess the physical bases of the model. The resulting model is applied to the simulation of the operating map of a multi-cylinder turbocharged engine. It is found able to reproduce CCV without the need to perform specific LES of that engine, highlighting a certain level of generality of the developed model.}

abstract = {This paper investigates the effects of clustering on the effective transverse thermal conductivity of unidirectional cement composites filled with natural hemp fibers. A typical clustering pattern with four hemp fibers embedded into cement matrix is designed as the representative two-dimensional unit cell, which is taken from the periodic cement composite under consideration, and a clustering degree parameter is introduced to adjust the distance between clustered fibers. For this heterogeneous two-component composite model, distributions of the heat flux component are obtained using finite element simulation for various clustering cases involving different global fiber volume concentrations, clustering degree parameters, and thermal conductivity of both fiber and matrix, to evaluate the effective thermal conductivity of the composite. To further reveal the effects caused by clustered fibers, a random cluster pattern of hemp fibers in the unit cell is considered for comparison with the present regular clustering pattern. Further, a simple theoretical model with specified flexible factor f is developed by matching the theoretical and numerical predictions.}
