abstract = {The capability for solving compressible fluid flows in the rotating frame of reference is added to an existed open-source CFD solver, namely, HiSA solver. The new implementation is explained and validated using the experimental data of the Sikorsky S-76 rotor. A comparison is presented between the moving mesh results obtained from the original HiSA code and the single rotating frame results achieved through the new implementation. The comparison includes an analysis of torque and thrust values, as well as computational costs. The results imply that, for evaluating the performance of an isolated rotor or for shape optimization purposes at the transonic regime, the single rotating frame method, like the one introduced in the current work, can provide accurate results within an acceptable computational budget. Furthermore, the results show that, at least 25 revolutions are required for the transient analysis to reach an acceptable steady-state converged solution like the one obtained by the single rotating frame method.}

The main application of these advanced tools focused on imaging physics and computational internal/external radiation dosimetry research. This paper provides an updated review of state-of-the-art developments and recent advances in the design of sophisticated computational models of the human anatomy with a particular focus on their use in radiation dosimetry calculations. The consolidation of flexible and realistic computational models with biological data and accurate radiation transport modeling tools enables the capability to produce dosimetric data reflecting actual setup in clinical setting. These simulation methodologies and results are helpful resources for the medical physics and medical imaging communities and are expected to impact the fields of medical imaging and dosimetry calculations profoundly.}

abstract = {The 10th annual International Conference of Students of Systematic Musicology (SysMus) took place on September 13–15, 2017, at Queen Mary University of London (UoL). The SysMus series has established itself as an international, student-run conference series aimed at introducing graduate students to networking and discussing their work in an academic conference environment. The term “Systematic Musicology,” first coined by Guido Adler (1885), nowadays covers a wide range of systematic or empirical approaches to theoretical, psychological, neuroscientific, ethnographic, and computational methodologies in music research. Presentations for SysMus17 focused on three central topics in relation to music: cognition and neuroscience, computation, and health and well-being. Each of these topics was the subject of workshops as well as keynotes by Prof. Lauren Stewart (Goldsmiths University of London and Music in the Brain Centre, Aarhus University), Prof. Elaine Chew and Dr. Marcus Pearce (both Queen Mary UoL), Dr. Daniel Müllensiefen (Goldsmiths UoL), and Prof. Aaron Williamon (Royal College of Music). Further presentations addressed issues relating to harmony and rhythm, musicians and performance, music and emotion, and sociology of music. This year’s conference brought together early-career researchers from the fields of musicology, psychology, and medicine, allowing them to socialize, share their work, and gain insight into interdisciplinary approaches to their subjects. SysMus17 was organized by students at Queen Mary’s Music Cognition Lab and was particularly marked by the series’ 10th anniversary, the live streaming of all presentations via social media, and a carbon-offsetting Green Initiative. The proceedings of SysMus17 will be available on demand from the conference website (www.sysmus17.qmul.ac.uk) and the videos will be made available for public access.}

Katherine Hayles stands as a powerful corpus for understanding what is at stake in a new regime of computation. A renowned literary theorist whose work bridges the humanities and sciences among her many works, Hayles has detailed ways to think about embodiment in an age of virtuality (How We Became Posthuman, 1999), how code as performative practice is located (My Mother Was a Computer, 2005), and the reciprocal relations among human bodies and technics (How We Think, 2012). This special issue follows the 2017 publication of her book Unthought: The Power of the Cognitive Nonconscious, in which Hayles traces the nonconscious cognition of biological life-forms and computational media. The articles in the special issue respond in different ways to Hayles’ oeuvre, mapping the specific contours of computational regimes and developing some of the ‘inflection points’ she advocates in the deep engagement with technical systems.}

abstract = {Cement augmentation in vertebrae (vertebroplasty) is usually used to restore mechanical strength after spinal fracture but could also be used as a prophylactic treatment. So far, the mechanical competence has been determined immediately post-treatment, without considering long-term effects of bone adaptation. In this work, we investigated such long-term effects of vertebroplasty on the stiffness of the augmented bone by means of computational simulation of bone adaptation. Using micro-finite element analysis, we determined sites of increased mechanical stress (stress raisers) and stress shielding and, based on the simulations, regions with increased or decreased bone loss due to augmentation. Cement volumes connecting the end plates led to increased stress shielding and bone loss. The increased stiffness due to the augmentation, however, remained constant over the simulation time of 30 years. If the intervention was performed at an earlier time point, it did lead to more bone loss, but again, it did not affect long-term stability as this loss was compensated by bone gains in other areas. In particular, around the augmentation cement, bone structures were preserved, suggesting a long-term integration of the cement in the augmented bone. We conclude that, from a biomechanical perspective, the impact of vertebroplasty on the bone at the microstructural level is less detrimental than previously thought.}

abstract = {A significant fraction of computational software for scientific research grows through accretion. In a common scenario, a small group develops a code for a specific purpose. Others find the software useful, so they add to it for their own use. The software grows to the point where its management becomes intractable and scientific results obtained from it become unreliable. This is in stark contrast with a small number of scientific codes that have undergone a design process, be it due to an upfront investment, or when haphazardly grown codes have reset and started again. At a minimum, these codes reduce the time to obtain research results for the communities they serve because individual researchers do not have to develop their own codes. They provide further benefits; the results they produce are more reproducible due to greater scrutiny, leading to better science. One of the more overlooked benefits, which is perhaps of greater significance, is that a well-designed code can expand to serve communities beyond the ones it was designed for. Thus, research communities with similar computational requirements can symbiotically improve computation-based research for each other. In this article, we present a case study of FLASH, a code that was designed and developed for simulating thermonuclear runaways such as novae and type Ia supernovae in astrophysics. Designed to be modular and extensible, users from several diverse research areas have added capabilities to it and adapted it for their own communities. Examples include cosmology, high-energy density physics, core-collapse supernovae, star formation, fluid–structure interactions, and chemical combustion. We give a summary of design features that facilitated the expansion and quantify the effort needed to expand into some of the above-mentioned fields. We also quantify the impact on different communities by mining the database of publications using FLASH, collected by its developers.}

abstract = {In the fourth industrial revolution, programming promises to be a fundamental subject like mathematics, science, languages ​​or the arts. Architects design more than buildings developing innovative methods and they are among the pioneers in visual programming development. However, after more than 10 years of visual programming in architecture, despite the fast-learning curve, visual programming presents considerable limitations to solve complex problems. To overcome limitations, the authors propose to associate the advantages of visual and textual languages in Python. The article addresses an ongoing research study to implement Computational Methods in Architectural Education. The authors began by describing the general goal of this project, and of this article in particular. This article focuses on the implementation of two disciplines ‘Computation for Architecture in Python’ I and II. The first discipline uses programming based on the construction of functions in the imperative language, implemented in the text editor, in visual programming, using Grasshopper methods. The second discipline, which is under development, intends to teach object-oriented programming. The results of the first discipline are encouraging; despite reported difficulties in programming fundamentals, such as lists, loops and recursion. The development of the second discipline, in object-oriented programming, deals with the concepts of classes and objects, and more abstract principles such abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism or encapsulation. This paradigm allows building robust programs, but requires a more in-depth syntax. The article reports this ongoing research on this new paradigm of object-oriented language, expanding the application of a hybrid visual-textual language in Architecture.}

Second, we describe ELs in terms of their heterogeneity and the inconsistency of educational policies that affect their learning opportunities in STEM subjects. Third, we describe contemporary views on STEM subjects and language with ELs that indicate that instructional shifts across STEM subjects and language are mutually supportive. Fourth, we describe promising instructional strategies to promote STEM learning and language development with ELs. Lastly, we close the article by reimagining STEM education with ELs and offer potential next steps. These foundational constructs and perspectives on STEM subjects and language with ELs are critical because they provide the conceptual grounding for the design of the education system for ELs.

abstract = {This intervention advances glitches as epistemological vectors for apprehending and engaging the significance of digitally-mediated spatialities that appear nonperformative against normative scripts of urban computational paradigms. Drawing on two strands of contemporary thinking about glitches as systemic design features of digital systems and as generative fissures within them, we mobilize a queer orientation that stays with the generative tensions of urban spatialities that present as idiosyncratic and as interrupting. We mobilize this epistemological approach through illustrative U.S. based examples of seemingly abandoned shared e-bikes, performatively ‘ugly’ homes, and wilful property dilapidation wrought through the registers of desire and aesthetics. In so doing, we show how glitch empistemologies render visible how the technocapitalist manufacturing of normative spatial desires for particular kinds of urban sociospatialities and aesthetic visual signatures are both secured and interrupted on digitally-mediated and -mediatized terrains. Glitch epistemologies establish the significance of small-scale disorientations in digital urban mediations, engaging these nonperformativities and non-computes as unexceptional openings onto everyday possibilities for politics in computational cities.}

abstract = {Pair Programming is considered an effective approach to programming education, but the synchronous collaboration of two programmers involves complex coordination, making this method difficult to be widely adopted in educational settings. Artificial Intelligence (AI) code-generation tools have outstanding capabilities in program generation and natural language understanding, creating conducive conditions for pairing with humans in programming. Now some more mature tools are gradually being implemented. This review summarizes the current status of educational applications and research on AI-assisted programming technology. Through thematic coding of literature, existing research focuses on five aspects: underlying technology and tool introduction, performance evaluation, the potential impacts and coping strategies, exploration of behavioral patterns in technological application, and ethical and safety issues. A systematic analysis of current literature provides the following insights for future academic research related to the practice of “human-machine pairing” in programming: (1) Affirming the value of AI code-generation tools while also clearly defining their technical limitations and ethical risks; (2) Developing adaptive teaching ecosystems and educational models, conducting comprehensive empirical research to explore the efficiency mechanisms of AI-human paired programming; (3) Further enriching the application of research methods by integrating speculative research with empirical research, combining traditional methods with emerging technologies.}

abstract = {This paper documents a computational approach to the design, fabrication, and assembly of customizable space structures built entirely out of flat-cut interlocking elements without the need of nodes, fasteners, cement, or glue. Following a Research by Design (RbD) methodology, we establish a framework comprising geometric and parametric modeling, structural analysis, and digital fabrication stages to examine the following research question: how might the modularity of a construction kit be combined with the plasticity of parametric descriptions to facilitate the design and fabrication of flat-cut space structures? We find that an adaptive joint design that resolves local deformations at the node and element levels can facilitate the construction of flat-cut space structures by making modular components responsive to local geometric, material, and mechanical demands. The research centers on the design and construction of an architecture-scale installation based on the Weaire-Phelan structure—an aperiodic space-filling geometric structure that approximates the geometry of foam—entirely out of flat-cut interlocking elements. Documenting the process in technical detail, as well as some limitations, the paper contributes to recent efforts to develop digital materials suitable for architectural applications. In addition, it contributes to extend the formal and architectural possibilities of flat-cut space structure design by facilitating “bottom-up” design explorations in concert with the structure’s tectonic resolution.}

abstract = {This article explores the use of modding as a formal tool for learning history. The article examines data from a formal analysis of Europa Universalis IV (EUIV), a survey of 331 EUIV forum participants and a case study of 18 university participants. Significant quantitative survey data indicated that 45% (149/331) of participants had modified EUIV, and of the 125 participants who responded with comments about modding, a significant number (86/125 responses or 68.8%) explained how they had learnt about history, geography or other subjects through the modding process. Closer analysis of survey and case study responses and mods reveals the variety of ways participants learnt and critiqued history through the modding process. The article discusses the data and the pedagogical affordance of modding in a few steps. First, the article briefly explores the evidence that indicates modding is popular within the EUIV gaming community. In this instance, it examines whether given the popularity of gaming practice, modding might also be seen as a new casual form of engagement with games. Second, the article reviews the modding process in EUIV and examines how both playing and creating mods may be beneficial for learning history. Modding is examined in terms of its pedagogical importance and the unique educational opportunities it may offer that are not otherwise accessible through other forms of game-based learning. Finally, the article explores how and what the case study participants learnt when they were tasked with creating and implementing playable mods to demonstrate their understanding of history. Overall, the article considers the growing importance of mods, how learners can create and represent history using mods and how mods can provide a platform for learners to develop their own critique and analysis of official history.}

The specifications are executable, thus providing a working prototype for free. Thanks to its well-founded semantics it can be used to reason about the correctness of the specifications, a fundamental aspect when safety critical applications are developed. Researchers working in the Logic Programming Group at DISI, a Genova University Department, have applied methods and tools of Computational Logic for modelling, prototyping, and verifying complex systems. These three research lines are largely overlapping: the complex systems we take into account are often multiagent systems, for which we propose modelling languages as well as prototyping environments and verification techniques.

abstract = {Much debate has taken place on Joseph Needham’s question regarding ‘the failure of China and India to give rise to distinctively modern science while being ahead of Europe for fourteen previous centuries’. It is argued in this paper that while there is probably some truth in many of the sociocultural explanations that have been offered for the failure in India, they are in the final analysis not entirely convincing. The proposal in this paper is in two parts. The first is that the scientific revolution, which was part of a European miracle, was triggered in part by the advent of a variety of technologies from China and the new numeral system and other mathematical inventions from India - both via creative West Asian intermediaries. India had experienced a mathematical (more specifically algoristic or computational) revolution heralded by Ārya-bhata in the fifth century CE. The new computational power unleashed by this revolution combined with the classical Greek penchant for axiomatised modelmaking and a technology empowered experimental philosophy, in what appears to have been a very creative and uniquely European cultural fusion that led to the scientific (and later the industrial) revolution. The second part of the proposal is that there was an epistemological reason why the Indian mathematical revolution did not lead to a corresponding ‘distinctively modern’ scientific one. The Indic approach was basically not that of modelmakers but of ingenious algorisers, and showed a deep and studied distrust of axioms and physical models. This led to an attitude described here as ‘computational positivism’, which considers observation and computation as the only things that matter. In retrospect, that distrust appears not unjustified, especially in the light of twentieth century developments in quantum and classical mechanics and in logic; but it was historically expensive for India, as Europe achieved unreasonably and unexpectedly spectacular successes in science. To the Indians, it was Newton who was the extraordinary epistemological revolutionary, not Heisenberg or Gödel. In summary, Indian science could not move forward without the modelmaking and technology enabled experimental abilities that grew in the West, just as European modelmaking had earlier been unable to progress without the advent of powerful technologies and computational tools whose roots can be traced to China and India.}

abstract = {This article proposes a three-step methodological framework called computational grounded theory, which combines expert human knowledge and hermeneutic skills with the processing power and pattern recognition of computers, producing a more methodologically rigorous but interpretive approach to content analysis. The first, pattern detection step, involves inductive computational exploration of text, using techniques such as unsupervised machine learning and word scores to help researchers to see novel patterns in their data. The second, pattern refinement step, returns to an interpretive engagement with the data through qualitative deep reading or further exploration of the data. The third, pattern confirmation step, assesses the inductively identified patterns using further computational and natural language processing techniques. The result is an efficient, rigorous, and fully reproducible computational grounded theory. This framework can be applied to any qualitative text as data, including transcribed speeches, interviews, open-ended survey data, or ethnographic field notes, and can address many potential research questions.}

abstract = {Creativity, one of the cornerstones of students’ 21st-century skills, is regarded as an important learning outcome of science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education. Meanwhile, problem-based digital making (DM), which combines the child-friendly programming activities of DM with problem-solving elements, is an emerging instructional design to facilitate STEAM learning. This qualitative case study examines the implementation of a problem-based DM instructional program that used the block-based programming tool Scratch to cultivate the participants’ creativity. Fifty-four middle school students (aged 10–14 years) in Hong Kong participated in the program, which totaled 10 contact hours over five consecutive weeks. Through triangulating students’ DM artifacts, video recordings, field notes, and interviews, the researchers characterized the students’ creative expression, examined the role of problem-based DM in encouraging creative work, and investigated the use of Scratch for mediating student creativity. The results showed that problem-based DM activities fostered students’ creative expressions in the dimensions of novelty, utility, aesthetics, and authenticity. While Scratch mediated the way the students presented their solutions, it had limitations that hindered the students’ digital artifact construction. The findings provide theoretical insights for framing creativity and offer practical implications for the implementation of problem-based DM in K–12 contexts.}
