abstract = {This article presents a numerical study of ventilation performance of balconies using computational fluid dynamics. The pressure coefficients distributed on the opposite walls of a five-storey building model, both with and without balconies, were studied under variation of the wind direction, balcony dimensions and building height. The effect of balconies on the capacity for wind-induced natural ventilation is discussed. The numerical results show good agreement with the experiments of Chand et al. They also indicate that a balcony enhances the cross-ventilation of intermediate floors but weakens that of the ground and top floors, by significantly changing the pressure distribution on the windward wall. Finally, the ventilation performance of a balcony is not greatly affected by variations in its size but is slightly weakened as the height of the building increases. Practical application: This study provides information and guidance in how best to incorporate the use of a balcony in building development at the design stage.}

abstract = {This paper evaluates with numerical computations the respective merits of two competing notions of coalition stability in the standard global public goods model of climate change. To this effect it uses the CWS integrated assessment model. After a reminder of the two game theoretical stability notions involved—core-stability and internal-external stability—and of the CWS model, the former property is shown to hold for the grand coalition if resource transfers of a specific form between countries are introduced. The latter property appears to hold neither for the grand coalition nor for most large coalitions whereas it is verified for most small coalitions in a weak sense that involves transfers. Finally, coalitions, stable in either sense, that perform best in terms of carbon concentration and global welfare are always heterogeneous ones. Therefore, if coalitional stability is taken as an objective, promoting small or homogeneous coalitions is not to be recommended.}

abstract = {Abstract Fuel impingement and film formation are critical issues for the goal of reducing hydrocarbon emissions from automotive gasoline direct injection engines. This computational study compares fuel impingement from a simulated air-assisted spray with that of a simulated spray from a swirl atomizer. Impingement occurs on a flat plate in a low ambient pressure case that approximates an early-injection condition and in a high ambient pressure case that approximates a late-injection condition. The simulated results suggest that the air-assisted injector produces substantially less fuel film and impingement than the swirl atomizer because of faster vaporization of smaller droplets and slower penetration. Although the swirl atomizer produces more splashing, much of the splashed fuel mass returns to the plate. More detailed numerical studies of the air-assisted injector were also conducted to ascertain the effects of turning the vaporization model off, employing a very fine grid, having angled impingement and changing the injector design to increase the initial spray angle.}

abstract = {Three-way junctions in folded RNAs have been investigated both experimentally and computationally. The interest in their analysis stems from the fact that they have significantly been found to possess a functional role. In recent work, three-way junctions have been categorized into families depending on the relative lengths of the segments linking the three helices. Here, based on ideas originating from computational geometry, an algorithm is proposed for detecting three-way junctions in data sets of genes that are related to a metabolic pathway of interest. In its current implementation, the algorithm relies on a moving window that performs energy minimization folding predictions, and is demonstrated on a set of genes that are involved in purine metabolism in plants. The pattern matching algorithm can be extended to other organisms and other metabolic cycles of interest in which three-way junctions have been or will be discovered to play an important role. In the test case presented here with, the computational prediction of a three-way junction in Arabidopsis that was speculated to have an interesting functional role is verified experimentally.}

The coefficient of friction can be reduced if a texture of suitable geometry is introduced. This can be achieved either in the region of maximum hydrodynamic pressure for a bearing with high eccentricity ratio or just downstream of the maximum film for a bearing with low eccentricity ratio. An additional pressure build-up produced as a result of the surface texture has been shown at low eccentricity ratios.}

A contrast between a technological and a poetic or computational revealing of place can then be established based on the phenomenological orientation of user to device, application and world. The emphasis on orientation and attunement has implications for application design and research on user experience.}

abstract = {This study is an evaluation of the computational methods in reproducing experimental data for a generic sports utility vehicle (SUV) geometry and an assessment on the influence of fixed and rotating wheels for this geometry. Initially, comparisons are made in the wake structure and base pressures between several CFD codes and experimental data. It was shown that steady-state RANS methods are unsuitable for this geometry due to a large scale unsteadiness in the wake caused by separation at the sharp trailing edge and rear wheel wake interactions. unsteady RANS (URANS) offered no improvements in wake prediction despite a significant increase in computational cost. The detached-eddy simulation (DES) and Lattice–Boltzmann methods showed the best agreement with the experimental results in both the wake structure and base pressure, with LBM running in approximately a fifth of the time for DES. The study then continues by analysing the influence of rotating wheels and a moving ground plane over a fixed wheel and ground plane arrangement. The introduction of wheel rotation and a moving ground was shown to increase the base pressure and reduce the drag acting on the vehicle when compared to the fixed case. However, when compared to the experimental standoff case, variations in drag and lift coefficients were minimal but misleading, as significant variations to the surface pressures were present.}

abstract = {Locomotive sanders are used to optimize the traction between the train wheels and the railhead by spraying sand into the interface. It has been previously shown that a large fraction of sand sprayed by the sanders does not make it through the wheel–rail nip, leading to sand wastage and thereby increasing the cost and refilling effort. In this study, pneumatic conveying of sand through the wheel–rail nip is numerically modeled through coupled computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method simulations. The gas phase, discrete phase, and coupled two-phase flows are separately validated against the literature, and the parameters affecting the deposition of sand into the nip are analyzed to determine their impact on sander efficiency. The aerodynamics associated with the particle-laden jet play a critical role in optimizing the amount of sand going through the wheel–rail interface, with the particle velocities being directly correlated with the sander efficiency. Particle–geometry interactions (e.g. particle bouncing) are found to have a negligible effect on the deposition. In the absence of crosswinds, it is recommended to employ particles with a smaller Stokes number to enhance the sander efficiency. A larger airflow rate through the nozzle is also recommended. Crosswinds strongly and adversely affect sander efficiency. The effects of crosswinds can be mitigated by reducing the nip–nozzle distance and using coarser particles.}

abstract = {In this paper we present the findings and recommendations that emerged from a one-day workshop held at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) on June 5, 2002, in conjunction with the National Energy Research Scientific Computing (NERSC) User Group (NUG) Meeting. The motivation for this workshop was to solicit direct input from the application science community on the subject of visualization. The workshop speakers and participants included computational scientists from a cross-section of disciplines that use the NERSC facility, as well as visualization researchers from across the country. We asked the workshop contributors how they currently visualize their results, and how they would like to do visualization in the future. We were especially interested in each individual’s view of how visualization tools and services could be improved in order to better meet the needs of future computational science projects. The outcome of this workshop is a set of findings and recommendations that are presented in more detail later in this paper, and are briefly summarized here. Scientific visualization is a crucial technological capability that plays an important role in understanding data created by computational science projects as well as experiments. In order to be effective, visualization technology should be easy to use for a non-expert. The term “easy to use” encompasses a number of different categories, including a short learning curve, tight integration with computational frameworks, availability on the desktop as well as the fixed visualization facility, tools that are tailored for each specific application domain, and low cost. Current visualization tools fall short in several key areas of capability. Few visualization tools are capable of processing large datasets, such as those commonly generated at NERSC. Better support for parallel visualization tools may prove useful in leveraging large parallel machines as visualization resources. Multivariate visualization - multiple grids, many species, and many dimensions - is needed in order to quickly gain insight into large datasets. Related “drill-down” capabilities, such as the ability to quickly move from macro to micro views (used in “data mining”), would be extremely helpful in understanding data but are missing from most visualization tools. Many application scientists perceive a conundrum when it comes to visualization support. Support for visualization within each individual program level is often inadequate or nonexistent due to funding constraints, yet support for visualization at the institutional level is also often inadequate or nonexistent. Better solutions are needed for remote visualization. Current approaches are further constrained by network bandwidth and access to resources. The proliferation of visualization tools and data formats poses challenges. Researchers must often master many different tools in order to achieve the desired results. Data format conversion is often required when moving between tools. Common data formats and frameworks for visualization tools are needed to reduce duplication of effort and better promote sharing of resources and results. Better communication is needed between the visualization and computational science communities. The computational scientists are often unaware of current trends and practices in the visualization community. By being more aware of the needs of the computational science community, the visualization research programs can be crafted so as to be more responsive to their needs. As a result of the workshop, we have developed a set of recommendations that can be summarized as follows: • Establish a coherent program that focuses on remote visualization. A remote visualization program should provide tools and infrastructure that can be used by multiple “virtual teams”. • Establish mechanisms whereby generally-applicable visualization technology is developed and deployed in a centralized fashion. • Develop a research program in interactive visualization with running codes that stresses the integrated design and development of coupled simulation-visualization methods. • Establish a research program in the areas of multi-field visualization and multi-dimensional data visualization. • Establish a research program in the area of automated data exploration for next generation petascale datasets.}

Accordingly, this paper aims to critically document and analyze the collective, computational, and cognitive biases that designers may encounter when working with these tools at this time. The paper delves into three hierarchical levels of operation and investigates the possible biases present at each level. Starting with the training data for large language models (LLM), the paper explores how these models may create biases privileging English-language users and perspectives. The paper subsequently investigates the digital materiality of models and how their weights generate specific aesthetic results. Finally, the report concludes by examining user biases through their prompt and image selections and the potential for platforms to perpetuate these biases through the application of user data during training.}

The efficacy of the approach is tested on the specific case of airport strategic planning. Utilizing a fast and simple model of an airport, and a composition of small models that can generate a wide spectrum of alternative futures, the performance of a dynamic adaptive plan is compared with the performance of a static, rigid implementation plan across a wide spectrum of conceivable futures. These computational experiments reveal that the static rigid plan outperforms the dynamic adaptive plan in only a small part of the spectrum. Moreover, given the wide array of possible futures, the dynamic adaptive plan has a narrower spread of outcomes than the static rigid plan, implying that the dynamic adaptive plan exposes planners to less uncertainty about its future performance despite the wide variety of uncertainties that are present. These computational results confirm theoretical hypotheses in the literature that DAP approaches are more efficacious for planning under uncertainty.}

abstract = {In recent years, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques have attracted enormous interest in the throughflow calculations, and one of the major concerns in the CFD-based throughflow method is the modeling of blade forces. In this article, a viscous blade force model in the CFD-based throughflow program was proposed to account for the loss generation. The throughflow code is based on the axisymmetric Navier–Stokes equations. The inviscid blade force is determined by calculating a pressure difference between the pressure and suction surfaces, and the viscous blade force is related to the local kinetic energy through a skin friction coefficient. The viscous blade force model was validated by a linear controlled diffusion airfoil cascade, and the results showed that it can correctly introduce the loss into the CFD-based throughflow model. Then, the code was applied to calculate the transonic NASA rotor 67, and the calculated results were in good agreement with the measured results, which showed that the calculated shock losses reduce the dependence of the throughflow calculation on the empirical correlation. Last, the 3.5-stage compressor P&W3S1 at 85%, 100%, and 105% of the design speed was performed to demonstrate the reliability of the viscous blade force model in a multistage environment. The results showed that the CFD-based throughflow method can easily predict the spanwise mixing due to the inclusion of the turbulence model, and predicted results were in acceptable agreement with the experimental results. In a word, the proposed viscous blade force model and CFD-based throughflow model can achieve the throughflow analysis with an acceptable level of accuracy and a little time-consuming.}

abstract = {Abstract Experimental studies using human volunteers are limited to low acceleration impacts while whole cadavers, isolated cervical spine specimens, and impact dummies do not normally reflect the true human response. Computational modelling offers a cost effective and useful alternative to experimental methods to study the behaviour of the human head and neck and their response to impacts to gain insight into injury mechanisms. This article reports the approach used in the development of a detailed multi-body computational model that reproduces the head and cervical spine of an adult in the upright posture representing the natural lordosis of the neck with mid-sagittal symmetry. The model comprises simplified but accurate representations of the nine rigid bodies representing the head, seven cervical vertebrae of the neck, and the first thoracic vertebra, as well as the soft tissues, i.e. muscles, ligaments, and intervertebral discs. The rigid bodies are interconnected by non-linear viscoelastic intervertebral discs elements in flexion and extension, non-linear viscoelastic ligaments and supported through frictionless facet joints. Eighteen muscle groups and 69 individual muscle segments of the head and neck on each side of the body are also included in the model. Curving the muscle around the vertebrae and soft tissues of the neck during the motion of the neck is also modelled. Simulation is handled by the multi-body dynamic software MSC.visuaNastran4D. Muscle mechanics is handled by an external application, Virtual Muscle, in conjunction with MSC.visuaNastran4D that provides realistic muscle properties. Intervertebral discs are modelled as non-linear viscoelastic material in flexion and extension but represented by ‘bushing elements’ in Visual Nastran 4D, which allows stiffness and damping properties to be assigned to a joint with required number of degrees of freedom of the motion. Ligaments are modelled as non-linear viscoelastic spring-damper elements. As the model is constructed, the cervical spine motion segments are validated by comparing the segment response to published experimental data on the load-displacement behaviour for both small and large static loads. The response of the entire ligamentous cervical spine model to quasi-static flexion and extension loading is also compared to experimental data to validate the model before the effect of muscle stiffening is included. Moreover the moment-generating capacity of the neck muscle elements has been compared against in vivo experimental data. The main and coupled motions of the model segments are shown to be accurate and realistic, and the whole model is in good agreement with experimental findings from actual human cervical spine specimens. It has been shown that the model can predict the loads and deformations of the individual soft-tissue elements making the model suitable for injury analysis. The validation of the muscle elements shows the morphometric values, origins, and insertions selected to be reasonable. The muscles can be activated as required, providing a more realistic representation of the human head and neck. The curved musculature results in a more realistic representation of the change in muscle length during the head and neck motion.}

abstract = {The authors argue that journalism’s uncertain identity in academia has made it vulnerable to unreflective instrumentalism in the digital era. They show how instrumentalism intertwined with the digital sublime constitutes a rhetorically resonate rationale for closing a journalism school. Evidence comes from documents and testimony associated with discontinuance of the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Colorado. Vulnerability of the school became apparent in its own Advisory Board recommending closure. The authors warn against stakeholders in journalism education internalizing the fear and opportunism implicit in a discourse of the digital sublime, a discourse ultimately in service to discontinuance.}

abstract = {The use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques enables performance predictions of bearing designs to be made when the usual operating assumptions of the Reynolds equation Jail to hold. This paper addresses the application of a full three-dimensional thermohydrodynamic CFD approach to journal bearings. The journal/shaft may extend beyond the bearing length and the rotation effect is accounted for in the thermal transport process. A circumferentially uniform shaft surface temperature is not assumed. Cavitation modelling is based on averaged lubricant/vapour properties and does not set pressures directly, allowing sub-ambient pressures to be predicted. Lubricant inlet grooves are incorporated with conservation of mass and the possibility of backflow. The modelling is validated against published experimental work on fully circumferential, single inlet and two-inlet circular bore bearings. The predicted and experimental results are in general agreement, although the predicted cyclic variation of journal surface temperature is less than the experimental value. However, an assumption in the predictions was of a non-orbiting journal. The techniques developed may, in principle, be extended to the orbiting journal case providing a dynamic cavitation model can be formulated.}

abstract = {The local blood flow in arteries, especially at bends and bifurcations, is correlated with the distribution of atherosclerotic lesions. The flow is three-dimensional, unsteady and difficult to measure in vivo. In this paper a numerical treatment of blood flow in general three-dimensional arterial bifurcations is presented. The flow is assumed to be laminar and incompressible, the blood non-Newtonian and the vessel wall rigid. The three-dimensional time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations are employed to describe the flow, and a newly developed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code AST EC based on finite volume methods is used to solve the equations. A comprehensive range of code validations has been carried out. Good agreement between numerical predictions and in vitro model data is demonstrated, but the correlation with in vivo measurements is less satisfactory. Effects of the non-Newtonian viscosity have also been investigated. It is demonstrated that differences between Newtonian and non-Newtonian flows occur mainly in regions of flow separation. With the non-Newtonian fluid, the duration of flow separation is shorter and the reverse flow is weaker. Nevertheless, it does not have significant effects on the basic features of the flow field. As for the magnitude of wall shear stress, the effect of non-Newtonian viscosity might not be negligible.}
