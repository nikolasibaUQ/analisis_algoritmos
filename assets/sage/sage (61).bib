abstract = {Background: Diverse thermal ablative therapies are currently in use for the treatment of cancer. Commonly applied with the intent to cure, these ablative therapies are providing promising success rates similar to and often exceeding “gold standard” approaches. Cancer-curing prospects may be enhanced by deeper understanding of thermal effects on cancer cells and the hosting tissue, including the molecular mechanisms of cancer cell mutations, which enable resistance to therapy. Furthermore, thermal ablative therapies may benefit from recent developments in computer hardware and computation tools for planning, monitoring, visualization, and education. Methods: Recent discoveries in cancer cell resistance to destruction by apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis are now providing an understanding of the strategies used by cancer cells to avoid destruction by immunologic surveillance. Further, these discoveries are now providing insight into the success of the diverse types of ablative therapies utilized in the clinical arena today and into how they directly and indirectly overcome many of the cancers’ defensive strategies. Additionally, the manner in which minimally invasive thermal therapy is enabled by imaging, which facilitates anatomical features reconstruction, insertion guidance of thermal probes, and strategic placement of thermal sensors, plays a critical role in the delivery of effective ablative treatment. Results: The thermal techniques discussed include radiofrequency, microwave, high-intensity focused ultrasound, laser, and cryosurgery. Also discussed is the development of thermal adjunctive therapies—the combination of drug and thermal treatments—which provide new and more effective combinatorial physical and molecular-based approaches for treating various cancers. Finally, advanced computational and planning tools are also discussed. Conclusion: This review lays out the various molecular adaptive mechanisms—the hallmarks of cancer—responsible for therapeutic resistance, on one hand, and how various ablative therapies, including both heating- and freezing-based strategies, overcome many of cancer’s defenses, on the other hand, thereby enhancing the potential for curative approaches for various cancers.}

Good performance is ensured by a load-balancing policy that enables NetSolve to use the computational resources available as efficiently as possible.

A novel approach for estimating k is through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applied to permeable asphalt (PA). Specimens of PA are examined in this study to evaluate CFD applicability. Tortuosity, effective porosity, pore size distribution, and specific surface area were determined based on three-dimensional specimen structures reconstructed using x-ray tomography analyses. Using CFD, estimates of k were determined and compared with physical measurements and also with the results obtained from the semi-empirical modified Kozeny-Carman model (KCM). The comparison shows that the numerical simulations with CFD can be a reasonable tool for estimating k and for examining transport of water through PA. Within the constraints of this study, results infer that CFD can provide more representative results for low k in comparison with KCM. For higher k, CFD and KCM results were reasonably comparable.}

Numerical predictions using computational fluid dynamics simulations could be a valuable alternative provided that the laminar-to-turbulent transition flow effects are fundamentally understood with the suitable numerical models developed. Experience suggests that the use of classical turbulent flow models may lead to high discrepancies especially at low rotational speeds where the effects of fluid flow transition from the laminar to the turbulent state may influence the predicted propeller’s performance. This article proposes a complete and detailed procedure for the computational fluid dynamics simulation of non-cavitating flow over marine propellers using the “k–kl–ω” transition-sensitive turbulence model. Results are evaluated by “ANSYS FLUENT 16” for the “INSEAN E779A” propeller. Comparisons against the fully turbulent standard “k–ε” model and against experiments show improved agreement in way of flow transition zones at lower rotational speeds, that is, at low Reynolds numbers.}

abstract = {Past research has shown that multidimensional computational fluid dynamics modeling in combination with a genetic algorithm method is an effective approach for optimizing internal combustion engine design. However, optimization studies performed with a detailed computational fluid dynamics model are time intensive, which limits the practical application of this approach. This study addresses this issue by using a machine learning approach called Gaussian process regression in combination with computational fluid dynamics modeling to reduce the computational optimization time. An approach was proposed where the Gaussian process regression model could be used instead of the computational fluid dynamics model to predict the outputs of the genetic algorithm optimization. In this approach, for every nth generation of the genetic algorithm, the data from the previous n − 1 generations was used to train the Gaussian process regression model. The approach was tested on an engine optimization study with five input parameters. When the genetic algorithm was run solely with computational fluid dynamics, the optimization took 50 days to complete. In comparison with the computational fluid dynamics and Gaussian process regression approach, the computational time was reduced by 62%, and the optimization was completed in 19 days using the same amount of computational resources. Additional parametric studies were performed to investigate the impact of genetic algorithm + Gaussian process regression parameters. Results showed that either reducing the initial dataset size or relaxing the error criterion resulted in increased Gaussian process regression evaluations within the genetic algorithm. However, relaxing the error criterion was found to impact the model predictions negatively. The initial dataset size was found to have a negligible impact on the final optimum design. Finally, the potential of machine learning in further improving the optimization process was explored by using the Gaussian process regression model to check for the robustness of the designs to operating parameter variations during the optimization. The genetic algorithm was repeated with the modified procedure and it was shown that adding the stability check resulted in a different, more reliable and stable optimum solution.}

abstract = {The effects of hydrogen addition to internal combustion engines operated by natural gas/methane has been widely demonstrated experimentally in the literature. Already small hydrogen contents in the fuel show promising benefits with respect to increased engine efficiency, lower CO2 emissions, extended lean operating limits and a higher exhaust gas recirculation tolerance while maintaining the knock resistance of methane. In this article, the influence of hydrogen addition to methane on a spark ignited single cylinder engine is investigated. This article proposes a modelling approach to consider hydrogen addition within three-dimensional reactive computational fluid dynamics in order to establish a framework to gain further insights into the involved processes. Experiments have been performed on a single-cylinder spark-ignition engine situated at a test bed and cater as reference data for validating the proposed reactive computational fluid dynamics modelling approach based around the G-Equation combustion model. Within the course of the first part, crucial aspects relevant to the modelling of the mean engine cycle are highlighted. In this article, a simplified early combustion phase model which considers the transition towards a fully developed turbulent flame following ignition is introduced, along with a second submodel considering combined effects of the walls. The sensitivity of the combustion process towards the modelling approach is presented. The submodels were calibrated for a reference operating point, and a sweep in hydrogen content in the fuel as well as stoichiometric and lean operation has been considered. It is shown that the flame speed coefficient A appearing in the used turbulent flame speed closure, weighting the influence of the turbulent fluctuating speed , has to be adjusted for different hydrogen contents. The introduced submodels allowed for significant improvement of the in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate evolution throughout all considered operating conditions.}

abstract = {Introduction: The volume of blood flowing through the vascular access is an important parameter necessary to provide adequate dialysis for a functional arteriovenous fistula. Higher blood flows are seen in arteriovenous access that receive inflow from larger arteries such as brachial or axillary compared to those based on medium-caliber radial or ulnar arteries. We hypothesized that an anatomic difference in the length and the diameter of the artery is an important determinant of the flow volume in arteriovenous fistula created at different anatomic locations. Methods: Using computational fluid dynamics, we evaluated the contribution of the length and diameter of inflow artery on simulations performed with geometric models constructed to represent arteriovenous fistula circuits. Lengths and diameters of the inflow artery were altered to mimic arteriovenous fistula created at various locations of the upper extremity with standard and variant anatomy. Results: Models of arteriovenous fistula created with variable lengths and diameters of the inflow artery suggest that the length of the vessel has an inverse linear relationship and the diameter has a direct linear relationship to flow volume. Conclusion: Computational fluid dynamic modeling of arteriovenous fistula can be used to understand the physiologic basis of clinical observations of function. Evaluation of the effect of inflow artery length and diameter helps explain the higher flows seen in arteriovenous fistula created using large caliber arteries for inflow. Computational fluid dynamic modeling helps operators understand the contributions of inflow artery in access function and can guide anastomotic site selection.}

abstract = {Objective: Set-inversion-based prandial insulin delivery is a new model-based bolus advisor for postprandial glucose control in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). It automatically coordinates the values of basal-bolus insulin to be infused during the postprandial period so as to achieve some predefined control objectives. However, the method requires an excessive computation time to compute the solution set of feasible insulin profiles, which impedes its integration into an insulin pump. In this work, a new algorithm is presented, which reduces computation time significantly and enables the integration of this new bolus advisor into current processing features of smart insulin pumps. Methods: A new strategy was implemented that focused on finding the combined basal-bolus solution of interest rather than an extensive search of the feasible set of solutions. Analysis of interval simulations, inclusion of physiological assumptions, and search domain contractions were used. Data from six real patients with T1DM were used to compare the performance between the optimized and the conventional computations. Results: In all cases, the optimized version yielded the basal-bolus combination recommended by the conventional method and in only 0.032% of the computation time. Simulations show that the mean number of iterations for the optimized computation requires approximately 3.59 s at 20 MHz processing power, in line with current features of smart pumps. Conclusions: A computationally efficient method for basal-bolus coordination in postprandial glucose control has been presented and tested. The results indicate that an embedded algorithm within smart insulin pumps is now feasible. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that a clinical trial will be needed in order to justify this claim.}

abstract = {Understanding the manoeuvring performance of a ship requires accurate predictions of the hydrodynamic forces and moments on the ship. In the present study, the hydrodynamic forces and moments on a manoeuvring container ship at various rudder and drift angles are numerically predicted by solving the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. The effects of dynamic sinkage and trim on the hydrodynamic forces are first investigated together with a grid dependency study to estimate the numerical error and uncertainty caused by grid discretization, and with a validation study combining the experimental data. The results show that the effect of dynamic sinkage and trim is non-negligible, since including it improves the hydrodynamic force predictions and reduces the numerical error and uncertainty, and the averaged error and uncertainty are smaller than the other computational fluid dynamics results where sinkage and trim were fixed with given values from model tests. Therefore, it is included in the subsequent systematic simulations regarding the influence of rudder and drift angles. The computed forces, moments and rudder coefficients at different rudder and drift angles on the container ship are compared with the benchmark model test data. From the computations, all the predicted quantities are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental data. The details of the flow filed and hydrodynamic forces, such as pressure distributions, transverse force distributions along the hull, velocity contours, streamlines and wave patterns are presented and discussed, and a deep insight into the physical mechanism in the hydrodynamic forces on a manoeuvring ship is obtained.}

In this procedure, an integration of the short-term and long-term mechanical processes of track deterioration is taken into account, using a track degradation model. This degradation model is incorporated into a finite element code where two modes of calculation are implemented: the “implicit mode” concerns the short-term track deterioration, in which the hypoplastic model is used for the ballast layer and the dynamic response to an instantaneous train axle passage is obtained to serve as input data for the “explicit mode”, which concerns the simulation of long-term track deterioration, using the accumulation model for ballast layer. The whole procedure is illustrated on the prediction of the ballasted track profile degradation of a track section of 100 m. The results show a significant influence of the type of track geometry defects and the vehicle velocity on the evolution of track deterioration and the capability of the proposed procedure in reproducing the track profile degradation.}

abstract = {Evaluation (the process attributing value to outcomes) underlies “hot” aspects of cognition, such as emotion, affect, and motivation. In several psychopathologies, such as depression and addiction, impairments in evaluation are critical. Contemporary theories highlight the reference-dependent nature of evaluation, whereby outcomes are evaluated relative to their context. Surprisingly, reference-dependent evaluation remains to be explored in the context of psychopathology. We offer a computational theory of how impaired reference-dependent evaluation might underlie mental illness. The theory proposes that evaluation derives from comparing an outcome against a reference point parameter and by weighting any discrepancy by an uncertainty parameter. Maladaptive evaluation is proposed to occur when these parameters do not reflect the true context statistics. Depending on which parameter is altered, different forms of maladaptive evaluation emerge, each associated with specific clinical conditions. This model highlights how the concept of reference-dependent evaluation can elucidate several clinical conditions, including perfectionism, depression, and addiction.}

The influence of the water spray characteristics on the downward smoke displacement due to drag and cooling is explained. Furthermore, an extensive sensitivity study of the simulation results to input parameters and mesh size is performed.

abstract = {This paper presents experimentally validated three-dimensional transient simulations of the thermal phenomena of the tape winding process, as well as a method to determine separately the heat transfer between the hot gas originating from a torch and the composite material. The computational model predicts the temperature of the incoming tape and the substrate during the winding process. Each numerical simulation is based on an explicit time integration scheme and covers the duration of the process. The simulation within each time step employs a steady-state model. This method takes into account the cyclic nonuniform heating of the material and the effect of the growing mass. The comparison of the simulation results with the experimental data shows good agreements. The experiments were performed with preconsolidated glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene tapes. The measurements were performed with infrared pyrometry. This technique can handle moving points during the entire process, and is nonintrusive.}

abstract = {This paper details the development of a generalized computational approach that enables prediction of cavity-internal sound pressure distribution due to flow-generated noise at high frequencies. The outcomes of this research is of particular interest for development of an acoustics-based structural health monitoring system for wind turbine blades. The methodology builds from existing reduced-order aeroacoustic modeling techniques and ray tracing based geometrical acoustics and is demonstrated on the model NREL 5 MW wind turbine blade as a case study. The computational predictions demonstrated that damage could be successfully detected in the first half of the blade cavity near the root and that the change in frequency content may be indicative of the type of damage that has occurred. This study provides a foundation to analyze specific blades and likely damage cases for determining key factors of system design such as number and placement of sensors as well as for hardware selection.}

abstract = {For large-scale wireless sensor networks, the nonlinear localization problem where only neighboring distances are available to each individual sensor nodes have been attracting great research attention. In general, distributed algorithms for this problem are likely to suffer from the failures that localizations are trapped in local minima. Focusing on this issue, this article considers a fully distributed algorithm by introducing a novel mechanism, where each individual node is allowed to computationally interact with a random subset of its neighbors, for helping localizations escape from local minima. Theoretical analyses reveal that with the proposed algorithm, any local minimum of the localization will be unstable, and the global optimum would finally be achieved with probability 1 after enough time of iterations. Numerical simulations are given as well to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.}

abstract = {The purpose of this article is to optimize the design of a pickup head that removes particles from road surface. A validated computational fluid dynamics model was proposed to evaluate the particle removal performance of the designed pickup head with different inclination angles. The gas-particle flow through the pickup head was modelled using the EulerianLagrangian approach. The realizable k model and the discrete particle model were adopted to simulate gas flow field and solid particle trajectories, respectively. The results indicate that the inclination angle of the rear edge wall and the pressure drop across the pickup head have great impact on the particle removal performance. Both the particle overall removal efficiency and the grade efficiency increase with the increment of inclination angle, and higher pressure drop can pick up more particles from the road surface, but it would induce unnecessary energy consumption. Therefore, it is necessary to design a pickup head with high removal efficiency and low pressure drop. Through simulation, the optimal angle should be 135 for the range of the inclination angle in this study, and pressure drop is about 2400Pa. Furthermore, more information can be acquired for pickup head design.}
