abstract = {Widespread availability of electronic health records coupled with sophisticated statistical methods offer great potential for a variety of applications for health and disease surveillance, developing predictive models and advancing decision support for clinicians. However, use of “big data” mining and discovery techniques has also raised ethical issues such as how to balance privacy and autonomy with the wider public benefits of data sharing. Furthermore, electronic data are being increasingly used to identify individual characteristics, which can be useful for clinical prediction and management, but were not previously disclosed to a clinician. This process in computer parlance is called electronic phenotyping, and has a number of ethical implications. Using the Belmont Report’s principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice as a framework, we examined the ethical issues posed by electronic phenotyping. Ethical issues identified include the ability of the patient to consent for the use of their information, the ability to suppress pediatric information, ensuring that the potential benefits justify the risks of harm to patients, and acknowledging that the clinician’s biases or stereotypes, conscious or unintended, may become a factor in the therapeutic interaction. We illustrate these issues with two vignettes, using the person characteristic of gender minority status (i.e., transgender identity) and health history characteristic of substance abuse. Data mining has the potential to uncover patient characteristics previously obscured, which can provide clinicians with beneficial clinical information. Hence, ethical guidelines must be updated to ensure that electronic phenotyping supports the principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice.}

abstract = {In this article, the authors demonstrate how the data center has become a key site, object, and metaphor for interdisciplinary scholarship of the internet. While the data center is a fabrication of engineering, computer science, and cognate fields, it has been the critical gaze of scholars outside of those industries. Together, this scholarship has established the field of Critical Data Center Studies. Critiques of the data center – often thought of more generally as ‘internet infrastructure’, and more evocatively as ‘the cloud’ – have emerged from the social sciences, humanities, journalism, and the arts. The authors do this by answering questions about the current social, cultural, political, and environmental landscapes of the data center. Scrutiny of the foundational imaginaries of the internet, real estate deals by Big Tech, the industry’s enabling policies, their connections to energy and other public infrastructure – among many other factors – serves, at the very least, to situate the data center as a media object, as more than simply a material infrastructure, as more than data warehouse, and as more than ‘the cloud’. Further to this, the authors reflect on how the data center has been and continues to be studied, and why critical interventions have been so fruitful within a vast array of disciplines – from history and anthropology, to media studies, information studies, and science & technology studies – for shifting the focus from questions of infrastructural visibility to questions that weave together concerns of efficiency, policy, popular culture, and planetary devastation.}

abstract = {Skin deformation caused by contact with an object is transduced into nerve signals by tactile mechanoreceptors, allowing humans to perceive tactile information. Previous research has revealed that the mechanical state associated with finger skin deformation at mechanoreceptor locations in a finite element model is correlated with the experimentally measured responses of slowly adapting type I mechanoreceptors. However, these findings were obtained under static contact conditions. Therefore, in this study, we calculated the von Mises stress at slowly adapting type I and rapidly adapting type I mechanoreceptor locations during dynamic scanning of a textured surface using a finite element model of the human finger. We then estimated the hypothetical responses of the mechanoreceptors and compared the estimated results with the nerve firing of the receptors in previous neurophysiological experiments. These comparisons demonstrated that the temporal history of von Mises stress at mechanoreceptor locations was more strongly correlated with the “number of” impulses (R2 = 0.93 for slowly adapting type I and R2 = 0.90 for rapidly adapting type I) than the impulse “rate” (R2 = 0.58 for slowly adapting type I and R2 = 0.53 for rapidly adapting type I). Our findings suggest that the temporal history of von Mises stress can be used to roughly estimate the number of impulses of mechanoreceptors during scanning of a textured surface.}

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance has become a serious global concern, and the discovery of antimicrobial herbal constituents may provide valuable solutions to overcome the problem. In this study, the effects of therapies combining antibiotics and four medicinal herbs on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were investigated. Specifically, the synergistic effects of Magnolia officinalis, Verbena officinalis, Momordica charantia, and Daphne genkwa in combination with oxacillin or gentamicin against methicillin-resistant (ATCC43300) and methicillin-susceptible (ATCC25923) S. aureus were examined. In vitro susceptibility and synergistic testing were performed to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration and fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index of the antibiotics and medicinal herbs against MRSA and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. To identify the active constituents in producing these synergistic effects, in silico molecular docking was used to investigate the binding affinities of 139 constituents of the four herbs to the two common MRSA inhibitory targets, penicillin binding proteins 2a (PBP2a) and 4 (PBP4). The physicochemical and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties and drug safety profiles of these compounds were also analyzed. D. genkwa extract potentiated the antibacterial effects of oxacillin against MRSA, as indicated by an FIC index value of 0.375. M. officinalis and V. officinalis produced partial synergistic effects when combined with oxacillin, whereas M. charantia was found to have no beneficial effects in inhibiting MRSA. Overall, tiliroside, pinoresinol, magnatriol B, and momorcharaside B were predicted to be PBP2a or PBP4 inhibitors with good drug-like properties. This study identifies compounds that deserve further investigation with the aim of developing therapeutic agents to modulate the effect of antibiotics on MRSA. Impact statement Antibiotic resistant is a well-known threat to global health and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most significant ones. These resistant bacteria kill thousands of people every year and therefore a new effective antimicrobial treatment is necessary. This study identified the herbs and their associated bioactive ingredients that can potential the effects of current antibiotics. These herbs have long history of human usage in China and have well-defined monograph in the Chinese Pharmacopeia. These indicate their relatively high clinical safety and may have a quicker drug development process than that of a new novel antibiotic. Based on the results of this study, the authors will perform further in vitro and animal studies, aiming to accumulate significant data for the application of clinical trial.}

abstract = {The selection of internal fixation as the primary fixation modality for the patient is one of the challenges for the surgeon treating the patient in question. A model of the lateral tibial plateau fracture was established. Three different configurations of internal fixators namely L bone plate, T bone plate, and screw-washer were analyzed. Three stages after surgery were simulated to assess the displacement of bone plates, screws, washers, and the stress shielding ratio in the fracture area. At three stages after surgery, the T bone plate showed better stability for patients during rehabilitation compared with the remaining two schemes, and the screw-washer scheme was the least stable due to the larger internal fixation displacement and stress shielding ratio in the fracture area. In contrast, the L bone plate scheme showed better stability in the early stages after surgery but was second only to the screw-washer scheme in the middle and late stages after surgery. The T bone plate showed better stability and became a new selection for surgeons to treat related patients. At three stages after surgery, the T bone plate has better biomechanical stability compared to the L bone plate and screw-washer schemes.}

abstract = {Aspects of criminological theory are premised on the belief that criminals make poor decisions. There have been suggestions that individual differences in self-control, willpower, impulsivity, time orientation, or more recently, thoughtfully reflective decision making (TRDM) influence choices and, ultimately, deviant outcomes. While much of the literature suggests there are differences among these concepts, they are often used interchangeably or at least noted to share common ground. Using survey data collected from university undergraduate students, this article explores the conceptual and empirical overlap and areas of distinction between key theoretical constructs. Using hypotheses derived from a dual-systems model, findings suggest impulsivity, self-control, temptation, and TRDM are distinct but interrelated constructs. Impulsivity was positively related to intentions to drink and drive in a hypothetical scenario, but temptation, self-control, and TRDM had no significant effect on intentions. Consistent with a dual-systems conceptualization, we found impulsivity and self-control work in tandem, as the risk of drinking and driving was highest for those respondents who were highly impulsive and had low self-control. Future research may seek to use a dual-system model to further reconcile trait-based and decision-based models of criminological theory.}

Next, I analyse the landscape for the reconfiguration of humanities venues and present arguments for engaging with space by referring to the functioning of digital humanities. This essay shows that place is an extremely important resource, seeing as it is endowed with the power to drive new practices, institutionalize a community, and consolidate a discipline. Therefore, humanists should reflect critically on the ‘architecture of the humanities’ and engage in making their own spaces that determine practices, communication, and well-being.}

The first relates to the context in which the process occurs; some educators highlight the importance of the personal context (i.e., conversations with self), while others assume more of an outward perspective in their thinking about empowerment (i.e., conversations with settings). The second important dimension relates to the focus or agenda of the conversations. Here, a distinction is made between agendas that are more epistemological in nature and those that are more political.

abstract = {It is well known that, despite his close engagement with cinema, Gilles Deleuze was less concerned with animated film, being somewhat dismissive of its capabilities. In recent years, however, a number of attempts have been made – most notably by William Schaffer, Thomas Lamarre and Dan Torre – to construct Deleuzian positions in animation theory. This article outlines some of these approaches, whilst engaging critically with Torre’s writings. In particular, it foregrounds Torre’s neglect of the post-structural, political dimension of Deleuzian thought through an examination of the concepts of faciality, the close-up, and relation as they occur in Deleuzian and Deleuzo-Guattarian philosophy. This is in part facilitated through a comparison of Stuart Blackton’s Humorous Phases of Funny Faces (1906) – a work directly addressed by Torre, and Emile Cohl’s Fantasmagorie (1908) – a work which he largely passes by. It is claimed here that, despite a number of apparent similarities, the animations of Cohl and Blackton express a radically divergent series of ontological commitments. Cohl offers the audience an experience of chaotic, mutable, relational complexity that revels in its incoherence, whilst Blackton presents a series of more straightforward set pieces, dwelling for the most part upon object-centric representational form. The tension between representation and becoming that occurs between these works is employed to facilitate a critical engagement with Torre’s process-cognitivism. It is suggested that Torre’s work, though exceptional in its pedagogic value, is likewise expressive of this tension, and that in its effort firstly to combine a series of process-philosophical and cognitivist ideas, and secondly to unpack the radical ideas of Deleuze through the more conservative philosophy of Nicholas Rescher, it runs the risk of falling back into a quasi-Kantian philosophy of generality and representation.}

abstract = {Serious games are a growing field in academic research and they are considered an effective tool for education. Game-based learning invokes motivation and engagement in students resulting in effective instructional outcomes. An essential aspect of a serious game is the method of support for presenting the teaching material and providing feedback. A support design that evaluates students’ progress and adapts accordingly, has the potential of producing better learning results. This paper presents an adaptive model based on fuzzy logic that adjusts the support acquisition according to student knowledge level. A serious game for teaching the concepts of sequence and iteration in programming to novice students was built to assess the model. It employs working examples as a support method since previous research indicated that it produced less cognitive load during problem-solving. An empirical study with 102 students has been conducted to evaluate the learning efficiency of the model. The analysis indicates positive results and a potential solution for balancing the amount of assistance in serious games.}

abstract = {Becoming proficient in scientific discourse such as argumentation or developing explanations can be challenging for students, including neurodivergent students (e.g., autistic students, students with learning disabilities, students with ADHD). Students need to practice developing arguments and explanations as well as sharing their conclusions with others; however, these opportunities do not regularly occur. The use of multimedia technology shows promise in being an engaging and effective way to support student learning and discussion of science topics and phenomena. This study investigated the use of a multimedia presentation called Dialogic Instruction for Argumentative Learning in Science (DIALS) in supporting upper-elementary neurodivergent students to provide complete responses to science questions. DIALS provides a structured inquiry investigation to the student in which they learn about a phenomenon through completing scaffolded animated experiments, explicitly learning how to develop an argument and respond to others conclusions, and learning relevant content information to support their argument and explanation development. An adapted alternating treatments design approach was used in this study. The phenomena explored were counterbalanced between three options: DIALS, PowerPoint comparison lessons, or control probe slides. Results from this study show promise in the use of DIALS in enhancing student complete responding to questions and providing quality claims for why they think phenomena occur. Implications for the findings are discussed.}

abstract = {This work presents a higher order finite element (FE) model to gauge the static behaviour of hygrothermo-magneto-electro-elastic (HTMEE) plates with different electro-magnetic circuits. The FE model is composed of eight-noded isoparametric elements. The displacement equations are presumed to obey the higher order shear deformation theory (HSDT) and the governing equations of motion are obtained with the support of the virtual energy principle. The correctness of the FE model is verified against previously published results. The influence of electro-magnetic boundary conditions associated with hygrothermal loads, stacking sequences, empirical constants and different loading profiles have been studied in detail. The results of this article are the first of its kind in literature. Hence, it is believed to set benchmark for future investigations on multifunctional structures.}

abstract = {Hashtag campaigns calling out sexual violence and rape myths offer a unique context for disclosing sexual victimization on social media. This study investigates the applicability of adaptive self-reflection as a potential self-effect from such public disclosures of unreported sexual victimization experiences by analyzing 92,583 tweets that invoked #WhyIDidntReport. A supervised machine learning classifier determined that 61.8% of the tweets were self-disclosures of sexual victimization. Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) analysis showed statistically significant differences in four psycholinguistic dimensions (greater use of past focus, cognitive processes, insight, and causation words) connected with reflective processing in tweets with self-disclosed sexual victimization compared to those without. Additionally, topic modeling and thematic analysis identified nine salient topics within the self-disclosing tweets, comprising three self-distanced representations (i.e., relatively abstract and insightful construals) of the unwanted experiences: (a) acknowledging one’s previously unacknowledged victimization, (b) reaffirming one’s rationale for not reporting, and (c) decrying invalidating response to one’s disclosure. Moving beyond reception effects and social support in extant research about social media as a coping tool, this study provides new empirical insights into the potential of social media to promote expressive meaning-making of upsetting and traumatic experiences in ways that support recovery and resilience.}
