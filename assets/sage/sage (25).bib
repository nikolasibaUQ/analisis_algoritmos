abstract = {This article advances a sociological approach to computational journalism. By “computational journalism” the article refers to the increasingly ubiquitous forms of algorithmic, social scientific, and mathematical forms of newswork adopted by many 21st-century newsrooms and touted by many educational institutions as “the future of news.” By “sociological approach,” the article endorses a research model that brackets, at least temporarily, many of the current industry concerns with the practical usability of newsroom analysis. The bulk of the article outlines a series of six lenses through which such an approach to computational journalism might be carried out. Four of these lenses are drawn from Schudson’s classic typology of the sociology of news—economic, political, cultural, and organizational approaches. In addition, the author adds Bordieuean field approaches and technological lenses to the mix. In each instance, the author discusses how particular approaches might need to be modified in order to study computational journalism in the digital age.}

abstract = {This commentary elaborates on the ideas and projects outlined in this special issue, from a specifically sociological perspective. Much recent work in sociology proposes ‘methods mashups’ of ethnography and digital data/computational tools in different and diverse ways. However, typically, these have taken the form of applying (with or without tweaks) the principles of ethnography to new domains and data types, as if ethnography itself is stable and immutable; that it has a universal set of methodological principles that unify ethnographic practice. Returning to anthropology (whence, arguably, ethnography originally came) is, therefore, a useful way to extend our methodological thinking to (re)consider what ethnography is and how it operates, and from there think more clearly about how it may be effectively combined with digital data/computational tools in an emerging ‘Computational Anthropology’.}

abstract = {Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) etiopathogenesis remains partially unexplained. The main conceptual framework used to study AD is the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis, although the failure of recent clinical experimentation seems to reduce its potential in AD research. Objective: A possible explanation for the failure of clinical trials is that they are set too late in AD progression. Recent studies suggest that the ventral tegmental area (VTA) degeneration could be one of the first events occurring in AD progression (pre-plaque stage). Methods: Here we investigate this hypothesis through a computational model and computer simulations validated with behavioral and neural data from patients. Results: We show that VTA degeneration might lead to system-level adjustments of catecholamine release, triggering a sequence of events leading to relevant clinical and pathological signs of AD. These changes consist first in a midfrontal-driven compensatory hyperactivation of both VTA and locus coeruleus (norepinephrine) followed, with the progression of the VTA impairment, by a downregulation of catecholamine release. These processes could then trigger the neural degeneration at the cortical and hippocampal levels, due to the chronic loss of the neuroprotective role of norepinephrine. Conclusion: Our novel hypothesis might contribute to the formulation of a wider system-level view of AD which might help to devise early diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.}

For many years the design of a modern turbine or compressor has been unthinkable without the help of CFD and this dependence has increased as more of the flow becomes amenable to numerical prediction. The benefits of CFD range from shorter design cycles to better performance and reduced costs and weight. This paper presents a review of the main CFD methods in use, discusses their advantages and limitations and points out where further developments are required. The paper is concerned with the application of CFD and does not describe the numerical methods or turbulence modelling in any detail.}

Understanding how VP structure influences the airflow during speech details is essential to the surgical improvement of pharyngoplasty. In this study, we aimed to illuminate the airflow features corresponding to various VP closure states using computed dynamic simulations. Methods: Three-dimensional models of the upper airways were established based on computed tomography of 8 volunteers. The velopharyngeal port was simulated by a cylinder. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were applied to illustrate the correlation between the VP port size and the airflow parameters, including the flow velocity, pressure in the velopharyngeal port, as well as the pressure in oral and nasal cavity. Results: The airflow dynamics at the velopharynx were maintained in the same velopharyngeal pattern as the area of the velopharyngeal port increased from 0 to 25 mm2. A total of 5 airflow patterns with distinct features were captured, corresponding to adequate closure, adequate/borderline closure (Class I and II), borderline/inadequate closure, and inadequate closure. The maximal orifice area that could be tolerated for adequate VP closure was determined to be 2.01 mm2. Conclusion: Different VP functions are of characteristic airflow dynamic features. Computational fluid dynamic simulation is of application potential in individualized VP surgery planning.}

The model takes as input a VR simulation video sequence and outputs the estimated average navigation velocity. When this estimated velocity is integrated into the published cybersickness dose value model (CSDV: So, 1999), the severity level of the cybersickness associated with the VR simulation can be predicted. Results of two simulation studies indicated that the average navigation velocities in lateral and vertical axes can be estimated to within 10% error. The simulations used a virtual environment (VE) with a known single depth. Discussion of an extension of the computational model to accommodate VEs with unknown multiple depths is included. The reported model is consistent with the biological neuro-pathway of the perception of visual motion velocities in humans. The benefits associated with this consistency are discussed.}

Our data comprise electoral party manifestos written in Finnish and published in Finland. The non-computational estimates are composed of the Chapel Hill Expert Survey estimates, the Manifesto Project estimates, estimates deriving from survey-based data on voter perceptions of party positions, and estimates derived from electoral candidates’ replies to voting advice application questions. Unlike Wordfish, Wordscores generates relatively well-performing estimates for many of the party positions, but despite this does not offer an even match to the non-computational methods.}

abstract = {Objective: We developed a computational model of the effects of sleep deprivation on the vigilance decrement by employing the methods of system dynamics modeling. Background: Situations that require sustained attention for a prolonged duration can cause a decline in cognitive performance, the so-called vigilance decrement. One factor that should influence the vigilance decrement is fatigue in the form of sleep deprivation. Method: We employed the methods of system dynamics modeling (numerical-integration techniques for modeling complex feedback systems) to create a computational model of the vigilance decrement. We then simulated the computational effects of sleep deprivation on the behavior of that model, using empirical data obtained from the literature for calibrating such effects. Results: Sleep deprivation of 2 hr over a 14-day period should produce an additional decline of 9% in detection performance over that found with the typical vigilance decrement, whereas 4 hr of sleep deprivation over 14 days should produce an additional decline of 14% in detection performance. Conclusion: With respect to dual-process theory, it is through its deleterious effects on analytical cognition that sleep deprivation should impact the vigilance decrement. Application: Such computational modeling may be advantageous for human-machine teaming by theoretically allowing a future autonomous software agent to anticipate the decline of human performance and compensate accordingly.}

abstract = {Background The creation and management of an autologous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) as vascular access (VA) for hemodialysis patients is still a critical procedure. The placement of a functional and long-lasting VA derives from adequate planning of the surgical procedure based on physical examination, vascular mapping and selection of the best modality for arteriovenous anastomosis. The risk of AVF non-maturation and early failure is high, even when all precautions are taken to minimize these events. In addition, AVF surgery may develop very high blood flow exposing the patient to the risk of heart failure or hand ischemia. Methods The choices of the surgeons on the modalities to perform a surgical intervention for AVF should take into consideration several factors including patient clinical condition, arterial and venous vessel sizes and elasticity. However, these evaluations cannot give direct indication on VA outcome in terms of blood flow after AVF maturation. We then took advantage of theoretical models of vascular network hemodynamics and of computational fluid dynamics to develop a numerical tool for the prediction of potential blood flow of a planned VA surgery on the basis of preoperative ultrasound evaluation of arterial and venous sizes and blood flow. Results Here we present the numerical model, previously developed and tested, and we describe the web-based application that has been developed to help during surgical planning. Conclusions The use of this tool in the clinical setting should allow to reduce the incidence of AVF non-maturation as well as incidence of VA complications.}

Computer-assisted mental health research is not simply a continuation of previous studies, but rather raises ethical, conceptual and methodological issues that are critical to behavioural science but have not yet been systematically explored. Based on a systematic review of n = 147 studies, we reveal a multidisciplinary field of research that has grown immensely since 2010, spanning the humanities, social sciences, and engineering. We find that a substantial majority of studies in our sample lack a standardized form of ethical consideration, focus on specific constructs and have a rather narrow focus on specific social media platforms.

abstract = {Background. Learning programming is a cognitively demanding field of study accompanied with various difficulties. Although there is a high demand in the market for programmers, software analysts and engineers, a high dropout rate is recorded in relevant fields of study. Serious games are a promising means of engaging students in learning programming by giving them more incentives and making the process of learning programming concepts and languages more entertaining. Aim. This article introduces a new serious game called PY-RATE ADVENTURES, which aims to assist young students in their introduction to the basic programming concepts using Python. The game does not have any prerequisites and is suitable for players with no previous knowledge of programming. This article aims to present important information regarding the analysis, design and pilot evaluation of PY-RATE ADVENTURES. Method. The game was evaluated by 31 people that had recently graduated or were students of an Interdepartmental Programme of Postgraduate Studies in Information Systems. The participants voluntarily played the game and answered a questionnaire based on the MEEGA+ model, after their hands on experience with the game. This questionnaire’s purpose was to evaluate PY-RATE ADVENTURES in terms of perceived player experience and short-term learning. Results. The participants positively evaluated the game almost in all the elements of player experience. Furthermore, the majority of the users consider that the game helped them to learn basic programming concepts in Python and stated that they would prefer to learn programming with this game rather than other teaching methods. Conclusion. The positive results of the pilot evaluation give us the motivation to proceed and evaluate the game with students in secondary education, in order to extract stronger and generalisable conclusions regarding the impact of the game as an educational tool for learning programming concepts.}

abstract = {Computational photography is currently altering the representational and social functions of photographic imaging. A range of heavily automated computational processing techniques produce images that remediate digital photography to circumvent physical limitations associated with the size of smartphones, emulating the aesthetics associated with larger format digital cameras and professional photographic workflows and practices. These processes include automated compositing where images seen by users are constituted of up to 15 individual frames, the simulation of a shallow depth-of-field, automated facial retouching and even providing automated assistance to suggest alternative frames within the image stream to serve as the base image. This article explores these emerging techniques and accompanying claims that such processes are radically transforming photographic practice. While the extent and modes of automation and algorithmic processing depart from prior practices, contextualising them within the histories of photographic compositing and the algorithmic malleability of digital photography suggests the intensification of existing trends rather than an epistemic break. Furthermore, exploring the representational politics of automated facial retouching and the datafication of images situates these changes within the broader social context of dataveillance and platform capitalism.}

abstract = {Computational modeling has long been advocated as an important tool in the scientist’s tool shed. They are common in physical and biological sciences, but are very rare in organizational psychology. This paper describes the role computational models might play in informing theory and science in organizational psychology. After describing the major advantages of computational models, architectures, examples, and resources are described. This is followed by a comprehensive review of where computational models have been applied and where they might be profitably applied in each of the major domains of organizational psychology.}
