abstract = {This article explores the role of images in the workings of contemporary power. It examines one of the central ways in which sociology has approached images as representations and proposes an alternative understanding of images through the concepts of interactivity, intensity and the virtual. Focusing on the examples of three interactive mirrors, one a piece of artwork, another designed to be located in a designer shop and the other a medical mirror for tracking ‘vital signs’, it suggests that the mirrors emphasize the screen and, in so doing, disrupt a notion of images of representations. Images are instead brought to life; intensively experienced rather than extensively read. The article engages, first, with the increasing prevalence of screens and, second, with the moves in sociology towards theorizing the value of the concept of the virtual. Arguing that images are felt and lived out, the article seeks to contribute to how sociology has dealt with, and might further develop, the concept of the virtual as a productive way of understanding the relationships between images, screens, power and life.}

abstract = {Skin deformation caused by contact with an object is transduced into nerve signals by tactile mechanoreceptors, allowing humans to perceive tactile information. Previous research has revealed that the mechanical state associated with finger skin deformation at mechanoreceptor locations in a finite element model is correlated with the experimentally measured responses of slowly adapting type I mechanoreceptors. However, these findings were obtained under static contact conditions. Therefore, in this study, we calculated the von Mises stress at slowly adapting type I and rapidly adapting type I mechanoreceptor locations during dynamic scanning of a textured surface using a finite element model of the human finger. We then estimated the hypothetical responses of the mechanoreceptors and compared the estimated results with the nerve firing of the receptors in previous neurophysiological experiments. These comparisons demonstrated that the temporal history of von Mises stress at mechanoreceptor locations was more strongly correlated with the “number of” impulses (R2 = 0.93 for slowly adapting type I and R2 = 0.90 for rapidly adapting type I) than the impulse “rate” (R2 = 0.58 for slowly adapting type I and R2 = 0.53 for rapidly adapting type I). Our findings suggest that the temporal history of von Mises stress can be used to roughly estimate the number of impulses of mechanoreceptors during scanning of a textured surface.}

abstract = {The addition of two emerging technologies (evolutionary computation and ecoinformatics) to computational ecology can advance our ability to build better ecological models and thus deepen our understanding of the mechanistic complexity of ecological systems. This article describes one feasible approach toward this goal–the combining of inductive and deductive modeling techniques with the optimizing power of simple algorithms of Darwinian evolution that include information-theoretic model selection methods. Specifically, the author shows a way to extend classic genetic algorithms beyond typical parameter fitting of a single, previously chosen model to a more flexible technique that can work with a suite of possible models. Inclusion of the Akaike information-theoretic model selection method within an evolutionary algorithm makes it possible to accomplish simultaneous parameter fitting and parsimonious model selection.Experiments with synthetic data show the feasibility of this approach, and experiments with time-series field data of the zebra mussel invasion of Lake Champlain (United States) result in a model of the invasion dynamics that is consistent with the known hydrodynamic features of the lake and the motile life history stage of this invasive species.The author also describes a way to extend this approach with a modified genetic programming algorithm.}

abstract = {There are over 70 low energy and carbon standards in use around the world. None of these standards have been designed by the clients who pay for and occupy the buildings in question. In this work, the client was asked to define the building code for the construction of a new 2800 m2 building via a structured survey. The resulting zero-energy standard simply required the building to incur no energy utility bill. One year of monitoring of the completed building was used to see if the standard had been met. The result of this work is a new way of thinking about environmental building standards that solves many of the issues of obtaining and maintaining buy-in from the client. Practical application: This is the first time that the client has played a key role in the definition of a low-energy building standard. Measured energy consumption and renewable energy generation data are presented and demonstrate that the zero-energy criteria were successfully met. This work is important as it shows that the client can have a meaningful input into the design of an environmental standard. The paper should be of interest to architects, engineers, building energy researchers and those interested in methods that can be used to reduce the energy demand of buildings.}

Two important dimensions are used as a basis for highlighting some important similarities and differences emerging in the literature on empowerment. The first relates to the context in which the process occurs; some educators highlight the importance of the personal context (i.e., conversations with self), while others assume more of an outward perspective in their thinking about empowerment (i.e., conversations with settings). The second important dimension relates to the focus or agenda of the conversations. Here, a distinction is made between agendas that are more epistemological in nature and those that are more political. An illustration is provided of how this framework can be used to better understand the dynamics involved in collaborative work with teachers.}

abstract = {Calculating math problems from memory may seem unrelated to everyday processing of emotions, but they have more in common than one might think. Prior research highlights the importance of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in executive control, intentional emotion regulation, and experience of dysfunctional mood and anxiety. Although it has been hypothesized that emotion regulation may be related to “cold” (i.e., not emotion-related) executive control, this assertion has not been tested. We address this gap by providing evidence that greater dlPFC activity during cold executive control is associated with increased use of cognitive reappraisal to regulate emotions in everyday life. We then demonstrate that in the presence of increased life stress, increased dlPFC activity is associated with lower mood and anxiety symptoms and clinical diagnoses. Collectively, our results encourage ongoing efforts to understand prefrontal executive control as a possible intervention target for improving emotion regulation in mood and anxiety disorders.}

We use a close examination of 106 science teachers participating in Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) to identify, through structural equation modeling, the essential features in supporting teacher learning from these experiences. Findings suggest that participation in RET shape science teacher practice and beliefs, which in turn influence practice. Essential features of RET include engaging teachers socially in the research context and in research projects that are personally relevant to them. The model suggests ways to maximize the professional development potential of RET intended to support engagement in disciplinary practices.}

abstract = {Recognizing individual needs and customer preferences is key to succeeding and increasing competitiveness in both the commercial and public sectors. In the public sector, this is one of the ways to increase the efficiency of public funds allocated to public libraries. However, in order to make the right decisions, library management needs quality information about preferences and consumer behaviour, even from customers who cannot be the subject of routine research due to their young age. Therefore, this article proposes a new methodology for surveying children in order to design library services. The proposed methodology, which integrates principles from ethnographic and sociological methods, aims to overcome the problems of conventional sociological methods, such as how to conceive a child as a respondent and how to determine their preferences from hypothetical situations. This article uses a specially designed questionnaire tool to identify preferences, behaviour and information from children (as visitors of a library). The authors learned that Czech children went to the library primarily for books and games. In addition, the data from the questionnaire revealed patterns in the children’s and adults’ behaviour when visiting the library. All of the data in this article can be used for further research into consumer behaviour.}

abstract = {This paper reviews the contemporary discussion on the epistemological and ontological effects of Big Data within social science, observing an increased focus on relationality and complexity, and a tendency to naturalize social phenomena. The epistemic limits of this emerging computational paradigm are outlined through a comparison with the discussions in the early days of digitalization, when digital technology was primarily seen through the lens of dematerialization, and as part of the larger processes of “postmodernity”. Since then, the online landscape has become increasingly centralized, and the “liquidity” of dematerialized technology has come to empower online platforms in shaping the conditions for human behavior. This contrast between the contemporary epistemological currents and the previous philosophical discussions brings to the fore contradictions within the study of digital social life: While qualitative change has become increasingly dominant, the focus has gone towards quantitative methods; while the platforms have become empowered to shape social behavior, the focus has gone from social context to naturalizing social patterns; while meaning is increasingly contested and fragmented, the role of hermeneutics has diminished; while platforms have become power hubs pursuing their interests through sophisticated data manipulation, the data they provide is increasingly trusted to hold the keys to understanding social life. These contradictions, we argue, are partially the result of a lack of philosophical discussion on the nature of social reality in the digital era; only from a firm metatheoretical perspective can we avoid forgetting the reality of the system under study as we are affected by the powerful social life of Big Data.}

abstract = {Purpose: Numerical flow analysis (computational fluid dynamics) in combination with the prediction of blood damage is an important procedure to investigate the hemocompatibility of a blood pump, since blood trauma due to shear stresses remains a problem in these devices. Today, the numerical damage prediction is conducted using unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations. Investigations with large eddy simulations are rarely being performed for blood pumps. Hence, the aim of the study is to examine the viscous shear stresses of a large eddy simulation in a blood pump and compare the results with an unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation. Methods: The simulations were carried out at two operation points of a blood pump. The flow was simulated on a 100M element mesh for the large eddy simulation and a 20M element mesh for the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulation. As a first step, the large eddy simulation was verified by analyzing internal dissipative losses within the pump. Then, the pump characteristics and mean and turbulent viscous shear stresses were compared between the two simulation methods. Results: The verification showed that the large eddy simulation is able to reproduce the significant portion of dissipative losses, which is a global indication that the equivalent viscous shear stresses are adequately resolved. The comparison with the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation revealed that the hydraulic parameters were in agreement, but differences for the shear stresses were found. Conclusion: The results show the potential of the large eddy simulation as a high-quality comparative case to check the suitability of a chosen Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes setup and turbulence model. Furthermore, the results lead to suggest that large eddy simulations are superior to unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations when instantaneous stresses are applied for the blood damage prediction.}

abstract = {Serious games are a growing field in academic research and they are considered an effective tool for education. Game-based learning invokes motivation and engagement in students resulting in effective instructional outcomes. An essential aspect of a serious game is the method of support for presenting the teaching material and providing feedback. A support design that evaluates students’ progress and adapts accordingly, has the potential of producing better learning results. This paper presents an adaptive model based on fuzzy logic that adjusts the support acquisition according to student knowledge level. A serious game for teaching the concepts of sequence and iteration in programming to novice students was built to assess the model. It employs working examples as a support method since previous research indicated that it produced less cognitive load during problem-solving. An empirical study with 102 students has been conducted to evaluate the learning efficiency of the model. The analysis indicates positive results and a potential solution for balancing the amount of assistance in serious games.}

The FE model is composed of eight-noded isoparametric elements. The displacement equations are presumed to obey the higher order shear deformation theory (HSDT) and the governing equations of motion are obtained with the support of the virtual energy principle. The correctness of the FE model is verified against previously published results. The influence of electro-magnetic boundary conditions associated with hygrothermal loads, stacking sequences, empirical constants and different loading profiles have been studied in detail. The results of this article are the first of its kind in literature. Hence, it is believed to set benchmark for future investigations on multifunctional structures.}
