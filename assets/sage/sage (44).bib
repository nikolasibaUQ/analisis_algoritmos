abstract = {This article describes a methodology to recognize emotional states through an electroencephalography signals analysis, developed with the premise of reducing the computational burden that is associated with it, implementing a strategy that reduces the amount of data that must be processed by establishing a relationship between electrodes and Brodmann regions, so as to discard electrodes that do not provide relevant information to the identification process. Also some design suggestions to carry out a pattern recognition process by low computational complexity neural networks and support vector machines are presented, which obtain up to a 90.2% mean recognition rate.}

abstract = {Abstract This paper presents some results obtained during the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of internal flows inside a hydraulic component, using a scaling technique applied to numerical pre- and post-processing. The main aim of the work is to demonstrate the reduction of computational work needed for a complete analysis of component behaviour over a wide range of operating conditions. This result is achieved through the adoption of a methodology aimed at giving the highest level of generality to a non-dimensional solution, thereby overcoming the two major limitations encountered in the use of CFD in fluid power design: computer resources and time. In the case study, the technique was applied to a hydraulic distributor and computations were performed with a commercial computational fluid dynamics code. The key factor of this technique is the evaluation, for a given distributor opening, of the Reynolds number of the flow in the metering region. Provided that this number is high enough to ensure that the discharge coefficient has reached its asymptotic value, the characterization of the flow by a single non-dimensional numerical run can be shown. The theoretical contents of the analysis of the re-scaling technique, which focuses on the engineering information necessary in component design, are described in detail. The bases for its subsequent application to actual cases are then outlined. Finally, a fairly close correlation between numerical results and experimental data is presented.}

Computational fluency performance was examined by grade-level expectancy (Grades 2—6) and skill area (whole numbers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division; rational numbers: fractions, decimals) using the Mathematics Operations Test— Revised (MOT-R). The findings indicated that these high school students with MD were fluent only in computational skills at the second- and third-grade levels. Computational fluency was found with most whole number basic facts in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Lack of computational fluency was demonstrated on many items dealing with subtraction of multiple digits or items requiring regrouping, most multiplication and division items, and rational number items involving fractions and decimals. The results are discussed in regard to instructional programs and curriculum organization for high school students with MD.}

To be fully predictive in terms of in-cylinder thermodynamics and flame structure, the employed combustion models must account for complex chemistry and turbulence–kinetics interactions. Within this context, the authors have implemented into an open-source code a model based on the multiple representative interactive flamelets approach and applied it to diesel combustion simulations. New numerical techniques were integrated in the proposed multiple representative interactive flamelets model in order to speed up the central processing unit time in integrating chemistry and the β-probability density function of the chemical species to compute composition in the computational fluid dynamics domain. A parallel validation was performed both with constant-volume and heavy-duty diesel engine experiments, selecting similar operating conditions. In such way, both flame structure and heat release rate predictions are analyzed and the model capabilities with respect to its setup and mesh structure are assessed.}

abstract = {One goal of experimental economics is to provide data to identify models that best describe the behavior of experimental subjects and, more generally, human economic behavior. We discuss here what we think are the three main steps required to make experimen tal investigations of economic games as statistically informative as possible: finding the solution of the ex perimental game under the postulated equilibrium or other economic models, selecting from a potential class of experimental designs the optimal one for dis criminating between those models, and choosing an optimal stopping rule that indicates when to stop sam pling data and accept one model as the best explana tion of the data. Each step can be computationally in tensive. We offer an algorithmic presentation of the necessary computations in each of the three steps and illustrate these procedures by examples from our re search on learning models in experimental games with incomplete information. These three steps of experi mental design and analysis are not limited to experi mental games, but the computational burden of imple menting these algorithms in other experimental envi ronments—for example, market experiments—requires further considerations with which we have not dealt.}

abstract = {Abstract In this study, a theoretical analysis of a heating and cooling cycle during sterilization of a three-dimensional pouch filled with carrot-orange soup was presented and analysed. Transient temperature, the shape of the slowest heating zone (SHZ) during heating and the slowest cooling zone (SCZ) during cooling were presented and studied. The simulation covered the whole heating and cooling cycles of 3600s and 1200s durations, respectively. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code PHOENICS was used for this purpose. Saturated steam at 121°C and water at 20°C were assumed to be the heating and cooling media, respectively. The partial differential equations describing the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy were solved numerically using the finite volume method. The liquid food used in the simulation has a temperature-dependent viscosity and density. At the end of heating, the SHZ was found to have settled into a region within 30–40 per cent of the pouch height above the bottom and at a distance approximately 20–30 per cent of the pouch length from its deepest end. In the cooling cycle, the slowest cooling zone (SCZ) was found to develop in the core of the pouch and gradually migrate toward the widest end. The vertical location of this slowest cooling zone was about 60–70 per cent of the pouch height. Experimental validation has been performed by measuring the temperature distribution in the pouch during heating and cooling, using thermocouples fixed at different locations. The predicted results were in good agreement with those obtained from the experiments.}

The LLW was at least 200 mm in length. The concentration distributions of the liquid core and liquid cladding solutions in the LLW system were predicted by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to validate the characteristics of the waveguide. The broadening of the region of the fluorescence of Rhodamine B excited by the guided light and the increase in the critical angle of the guided light with the increase in the contact time of the core and the cladding solutions were well explained by CFD calculations. However, no substantial leakage of the guided light was observed despite the considerably large change in the refractive index profile of the LLW; thus, a narrower and longer waveguide was realized.}

In this paper, for the first time, we compare and contrast the performance of two models, CoLiDeS and CoLiDeS+, on two real websites from the domains of technology and health, under two conditions of task difficulty, simple and difficult. We found that CoLiDeS+ predicted more hyperlinks on the correct path and had a higher path completion ratio than CoLiDeS. CoLiDeS+ found the target page more often than CoLiDeS, took more steps to reach the target page and was more ‘disoriented’ than CoLiDeS for difficult tasks. Difficult tasks in general for both models had less task success and lower path completion ratio, predicted less hyperlinks on the correct path, visited pages with lower mean LSA and took more steps to complete compared with simple tasks. Overall, inclusion of context from previously visited pages and implementation of backtracking strategies (which are both part of CoLiDeS+) led to better modelling performance. Suggestions to further improve the performance of these computational cognitive models on real websites are discussed.}

abstract = {Driver distraction is one of the major causes for fatal car accidents. In a distracting activity, manual distraction is a triggered response of other types of distraction, such as cognitive and visual distraction. Therefore, recognition of manual distraction can contribute to the monitoring of overall drivers’ distraction. In this study, a computer vision-based method to track hand movement from the recorded driving behavior is proposed. This method integrates a low computational cost template matching algorithm using fast normalized cross coefficient (NCC) and a novel searching strategy. The proposed method was evaluated by the VIVA hand tracking data set. It achieves 50.83% of marginal accuracy percentage (mAP), 42.18% of multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA), 31.56% of mostly tracked (MT), and 19.29% of mostly lost (ML), and it outperformed a state of the art algorithm in MOTA and MT. Additionally, the computational cost of the proposed method is greatly improved, and it can run at around 11.1 frames per second. The outcome of this research will further assist driving distraction recognition and mitigation, and improve driving safety.}

abstract = {Abstract A multi-body computational model of the human head and neck was previously shown to be in good agreement with experimental findings from actual human cervical spine specimens. The model segments were tested in three directions of loading showing main and coupled motions to be accurate and realistic. The model’s ability to predict the dynamic response of the head and neck, when subjected to acceleration pulses representing frontal, lateral, and rear-end impacts, is verified using experimental data derived from sled acceleration tests with human volunteers for 15 g frontal and 7 g lateral impacts and from isolated cervical spine specimen tests for rear-end impacts. Response corridors based on sled acceleration tests with human volunteers for frontal and lateral impacts are used to evaluate the model and investigate the effect of muscle activation on the head-neck motion. Firstly, the impacts are simulated with both passive and active muscle behaviour. Secondly, the local loads in the soft-tissue elements during the frontal impact are analysed. For rear-end impact simulation experiments using ligamentous isolated cervical spine specimens are used to evaluate the model performance before investigating the effects of muscle tensioning. Good agreement with human volunteer response corridors resulting from frontal and lateral impacts, and isolated cervical spine specimen sled test rear-end impact experiments is demonstrated for the model, highlighting the important role the muscles of the neck play in the head-neck response to acceleration impacts. The model is shown to be able to predict the loads and deformations of the cervical spine components making it suitable for injury analysis.}

An innovative computational decision support tool for use in bridge aesthetics is described. The system contains a knowledge base created by using an extensive literature survey and by completing in-depth knowledge elicitation from leading bridge designers in the United Kingdom and with the support of the Department of Transport. To further validate the knowledge base, the rules elicited from the designers were tested against public opinion through a series of questionnaires. This procedure enabled the construction of a knowledge base that supports many aspects of aesthetics for small- to medium-sized span road bridges. This limited domain was chosen because this form of bridge is currently the most commonly constructed in Britain, yet generally receives little attention in terms of aesthetics because of time and economic constraints. The knowledge base has been incorporated into a system aimed at providing interactive advice on comparative bridge design. The system was developed in Visual C + + to run on a personal computer and to operate in a Windows environment. It is currently undergoing prolonged evaluation in practicing bridge design offices. To date, this evaluation has shown that engineers like the system and would find it useful. Therefore, commercial exploitation is currently being explored. The comments received during the evaluation are also being used to further tailor the system to suit practicing engineers’ needs.}

The dual-route cascaded (DRC) computational model of reading (Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon, & Ziegler, 2001) has offered an explanation for how the MOPE might occur in humans. However, there has been some empirical discrepancy regarding whether for nonword items the effect is limited to the first-letter/phoneme overlap between primes and targets or whether orthographic/phonological priming effects occur beyond the first letter/phoneme. Experiment 1 tested these two possibilities. The human results, which were successfully simulated by the DRC model, showed priming beyond the first letter/phoneme. Nevertheless, two recent versions of the DRC model made different predictions regarding the nature of these priming effects. Experiment 2 examined whether it is facilitatory, inhibitory, or both, in order to adjudicate between the two versions of the model. The human results showed that primes exert both facilitatory and inhibitory effects.}

The ChemlO project has addressed this problem by defining an I/O interface that captures the I/O patterns found in important computational chemistry applications and by providing high performance imple mentations of this interface on multiple platforms. This development broadens the user community for parallel I/O techniques and provides new insights into the functionality required in general purpose scalable I/O libraries and the techniques required to achieve high performance I/O on scalable parallel computers.}

abstract = {In a crosswind scenario, the risk of high-speed trains overturning increases when they run on viaducts since the aerodynamic loads are higher than on the ground. In order to increase safety, vehicles are sheltered by fences that are installed on the viaduct to reduce the loads experienced by the train. Windbreaks can be designed to have different heights, and with or without eaves on the top. In this paper, a parametric study with a total of 12 fence designs was carried out using a two-dimensional model of a train standing on a viaduct. To asses the relative effectiveness of sheltering devices, tests were done in a wind tunnel with a scaled model at a Reynolds number of 1 × 105, and the train’s aerodynamic coefficients were measured. Experimental results were compared with those predicted by Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations of flow, showing that a computational model is able to satisfactorily predict the trend of the aerodynamic coefficients. In a second set of tests, the Reynolds number was increased to 12 × 106 (at a free flow air velocity of 30 m/s) in order to simulate strong wind conditions. The aerodynamic coefficients showed a similar trend for both Reynolds numbers; however, their numerical value changed enough to indicate that simulations at the lower Reynolds number do not provide all required information. Furthermore, the variation of coefficients in the simulations allowed an explanation of how fences modified the flow around the vehicle to be proposed. This made it clear why increasing fence height reduced all the coefficients but adding an eave had an effect mainly on the lift force coefficient. Finally, by analysing the time signals it was possible to clarify the influence of the Reynolds number on the peak-to-peak amplitude, the time period and the Strouhal number.}

abstract = {This paper deals with the treatment of stress in Greek inflectional morphology. First, a morphological processor is presented which is built on the basis of a linguistic analysis of Greek inflected forms. This is followed by a discussion of how stress applies to words and how stress shift phenomena are taken into account by the morphological processor. In Greek, word stress distribution is important because it represents a major difficulty in every attempt to create a morphological processor which can be used by speech recognition systems, machine readable dictionaries, and machine translation projects involving Greek as source or target language.}
