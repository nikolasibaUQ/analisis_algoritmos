abstract = {In recent years, impact-resistant structures are highly sought after in various fields such automotive and aerospace applications as they proved notable performances, garnering significant success. The aim of this study is to assess the behavior of the 3D-printable honeycombs subjected to low velocity impact, for providing insights into absorbed energy for different core designs: hexagonal, auxetic, and rectangular, considering an equal number of cells across all designs. This work reports the computational and experimental studies conducted for sandwich structures under different impact loading. The experimental impact tests are carried out using a drop weight impact-testing machine. The examined specimen comprises two face-sheets and architected cell core fabricated through the Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) process made of polylactic acid (PLA). Variations in the geometric design of the cells result in the formation of cores with auxetic and non-auxetic topologies. Uniaxial tensile tests are performed to identify the mechanical properties of the involved biopolymer. The second attempt consists on comparing three architectural core structures under impact test using experimental and computational methods. Our findings highlight the specific influence of core topology on energy absorption in 3D-printed sandwich structures. Results indicate that while all three configurations (hexagonal, re-entrant, and rectangular) demonstrate comparable energy absorption values, the specific mechanisms and efficiencies vary, with re-entrant cores exhibiting distinct behaviors under impact.}

abstract = {Abstract This paper investigated the biomechanics of two clinical cases of bone fracture treatments. Both fractures were treated with the same locking compression plate but with different numbers of screws as well as different plate materials. The fracture treated with 12 screws (rigid fixation) failed at 7 weeks with the plate breaking; the fracture with six screws (flexible fixation) endured the entire healing process. It was hypothesized that the plate failure in the unsuccessful case was due to the material fatigue induced by stress concentration in the plate. As the two clinical cases had different fracture locations and different plate materials, finite element simulations were undertaken for each fractured bone fixed by both a rigid and a flexible method. This enabled comparisons to be made between the rigid and flexible fixation methods. The fatigue life was assessed for each fixation method. The results showed that the stress in the rigid fixation methods could be significantly higher than that in flexible fixation methods. The fatigue analyses showed that, with the stress level in flexible fixation (i.e. with fewer screws), the plate was able to endure 2000 days, and that the plate in rigid fixation could fail by fatigue fracture in 20 days. The paper concludes that the rigid fixation method resulted in serious stress concentrations in the plate, which induced fatigue failure. The flexible fixation gave sufficient stability and was better for fracture healing.}

abstract = {We report on our experiences in building a computational environment for tomographic image analysis for marine seismologists studying the structure and evolution of mid- ocean ridge volcanism. The computational environment is determined by an evolving set of requirements for this problem domain and includes needs for high performance parallel computing, large data analysis, model visualiza tion, and computation interaction and control. Although these needs are not unique in scientific computing, the integration of techniques for seismic tomography with tools for parallel computing and data analysis into a com putational environment was (and continues to be) an interesting, important learning experience for researchers in both disciplines. For the geologists, the use of the environment led to fundamental geologic discoveries on the East Pacific Rise, the improvement of parallel ray-trac ing algorithms, and a better regard for the use of compu tational steering in aiding model convergence. The com puter scientists received valuable feedback on the use of programming, analysis, and visualization tools in the en vironment. In particular, the tools for parallel program data query (DAQV) and visualization programming (Viz) were demonstrated to be highly adaptable to the problem do main. We discuss the requirements and the components of the environment in detail. Both accomplishments and limitations of our work are presented.}

A lot of work was conducted experimentally, whereas only limited numerical work is available in the context of three-dimensional modelling of the full engine cycle. This work addresses this fact by proposing a reactive computational fluid dynamics modelling framework to consider the effects of hydrogen addition on the combustion process. Part I of this two-part study focuses on the modelling and crucial considerations in order to predict the mean cycle based on the G-equation combustion model using the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. There, the effect of increased burning speed was globally captured by increasing the flame speed coefficient A, appearing in the considered flame speed closure. The proposed simplified modelling of the early flame stage proved to be robust for the conducted hydrogen variation from 0 to 50 vol% H2 for stoichiometric and lean operation. Scope of this work, Part II, are cyclic fluctuations and the hydrogen influence thereon using large eddy simulation and the proposed modelling framework. The model is probed towards its capabilities to predict the fluctuation of the combustion process for 0 and 50 vol% H2 and correlations influencing the observed peak pressure of the individual cycle are presented. It is shown that the considered approach is capable to reproduce the cyclic fluctuations of the combustion process under the influence of hydrogen addition as well as lean operation. The importance of the early flame phase with respect to arising fluctuations is highlighted as well as the contribution of the resolved scales in terms of the flame front wrinkling.}

As a mode of instruction, thinking aloud was first employed by teachers who modeled their processing during reading, making overt the strategies they were using to comprehend text. Subsequently, instructional approaches were developed to engage students themselves in thinking aloud. Such endeavors revealed facilitation effects on text understanding.

We review the available faultline measures with regard to their properties and identify several limitations, including dealing with more than two subgroups. We thus propose a new cluster-based approach, average silhouette width (ASW), that identifies the number of subgroups and subgroup membership. We then compare the measures with 1,400 simulated teams with varying properties and investigate their factor structure and their behavior under missing values. We also investigate the predictive validity of the measures with data from real work teams. Results show that different measures respond to different team features in different ways but that most of them load on two correlated factors. Taken together, the ASW measure had the most favorable attributes and was the only measure that accurately determined subgroup membership in the presence of more than two subgroups. We discuss limitations and further research opportunities pertaining to faultline measures and provide software for calculating all investigated measures at http://www.group-faultlines.org.}

abstract = {Abstract Increasing demand from the consumer for higher levels of refinement from their passenger vehicles has put considerable pressure on the automotive industry to produce ever quieter cars. In order to prevent the occurrence of many forms of brake noise, especially judder and drone, excessive heating of the brake disc must be avoided, while minimizing temperature variations across the rotor. In order for this to be achieved the brake rotor must be designed such that it ensures sufficient uniform heat dissipation and thermal capacity. In high-demand braking applications, vented discs consisting of two rubbing surfaces separated by straight radial vanes are normally employed, as they utilize a greater surface area to dissipate heat. Within this paper the effects of changing the geometry of the first row of pins on aerothermo-dynamic properties of a pin-vented brake rotor are investigated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The validated CFD model shows that decreasing the thickness of the first row of pins by 10 per cent improves the mass flowrate through the rotor by 14 per cent and the heat transfer rate by 6 per cent. The results obtained can be used for the design of brake discs which are efficient with respect to heat dissipation.}

Over the course of 3 weeks, participants in these four groups were asked to solve programming problems using Python with WOE and metacognitive scaffolding. The results demonstrate that the provision of metacognitive scaffolding with faded WOE (FWM) is the most effective for problem-solving programming and self-regulation skills. In addition, an interaction effect exists between the two treatments for the germane load in FWM. Therefore, results in this study provide empirical insights into ways to effectively apply WOE and metacognitive scaffolding to problem-solving processes for programming-based complex problem-solving, especially for novice learners.}

abstract = {A theoretical study is presented for predicting the hygrothermal behavior of laminated composite plates during moisture desorption. This investigation is aimed at overcoming the computational difficulties in the determination of transient hygroscopic stress distribution through laminated plates and in the evaluation of the effect of anisotropy on the evolution of such stresses. To calculate such stresses during desorption phase, we present a new method by which we are able to predict directly the evolution of transient hygroscopic stresses within laminated composite plates without the calculation of moisture concentrations as in the case of Benkeddad’s method in which we are obliged to determine the moisture distribution across the plate before the calculation of such stresses. This is very important and must be taken into account in the design of composite material, particularly aerospace structures for example, aircraft. The second part of this investigation is devoted to the analysis of the effect of anisotropy on the hygrothermal behavior of laminated plates during moisture desorption. The polar representation method of anisotropic properties is selected as a convenient tool for this study. By this method, the author is able to assess the anisotropy of composite laminated plates using the degree of anisotropy. Some stacking sequences with different in-plane degree of anisotropy were investigated in order to show the effect of anisotropy on the transverse hygroscopic stresses. Finally, the results of this paper can be used to guide the derivation of future by opening a way for the optimal design of composite structures submitted to a moist environment.}

Algorithms for segmenting arm movements into pieces are proposed. It is suggested that for a large class of arm movements recognition could be reliably achieved based only on the description of the hand shape and path in the body coordinates, without needing the detailed description of the variation of all the joint angles of the arm.}

abstract = {Complicated flowfields near casing in a transonic axial flow compressor rotor have been numerically investigated in this paper. Two vortex identification methods, namely the Eigenvector Method and Lambda 2 Method, are introduced as important tools for the graphical representation of the concentrated vortices arising from tip leakage flow and blade boundary layer separation. The analysis of the numerical results reveals that multiple tip vortices whose development are dependent on the variation of shock wave configuration are observed at conditions around the peak efficiency point. However, with the decrease of the massflow rate, only the well-known tip leakage vortex and the second tip vortex are left in the tip region due to the disappearance of the second shock wave. Then when the massflow rate further decreases to the stall limit, an deceleration flow region emerges downstream of the shock wave due to an increasing interaction between the first shock wave and the well-known tip leakage vortex. The tip leakage vortex further experiences a bubble-type and then spiral-type breakdown at near stall flow conditions. In addition, the validity of the two vortex identification methods is also discussed in this paper. It is found that both methods are able to identify and accentuate the concentrated streamwise vortices near casing when a vortex is not disrupted. However, if the vortex breakdown occurs, only Eigenvector Method can describe the breakdown region in a deep view.}

abstract = {Three arrangement types of fibrous media have been established including “Mesh” (layered distribution), “Para” (unidirectional distribution), and “Nurbs” (random distribution), with fiber diameters ranging from 5 to 7 µm and solid volume fractions ranging from 14.58% to 21.95%. To describe the filtration performance, particles trajectories, and the influence of structural parameters of fibrous media, the computation fluid dynamics is adopted. The filtration efficiency and the pressure drop of fibrous media are calculated in computation fluid dynamics and semi-analytical model. It is found that the arrangement types have significant effects on the filtration efficiency and show the limitation of the semi-analytical model. With the Stokes number larger than 1, the numerical results and semi-analytical model have great consistency in the filtration efficiency for the “Mesh” and “Para” types than “Nurbs” type. Meanwhile, the pressure drop between the numerical results and the semi-analytical model is always consistent.}
