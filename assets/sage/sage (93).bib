abstract = {Technology is an all-encompassing aspect of life in the 21st century. Its existence has implications on how communication occurs, education is shaped, knowledge is spread, and ideas are formulated. There is a significant shift taking place in society as we become more accustomed to existing in a digital world. Digital natives, young people who have been born into a virtual reality, view the world differently, have a ‘digital footprint,’ process info-graphics speedily, but lack basic capacity for interpersonal interactions. They also present neurological differences from those who were exposed to digital technologies later in life. However, regardless of human capacity for technological understanding, digital technologies adversely impact our shared humanity and the ubiquitous nature of these technologies is quite frightening. As a high school English teacher, I experience the impact of digital technologies on learning and language expression first-hand through my work with digital natives. My concern is that because of student dependence on the rapid influx of digital technologies, they will not possess certain imperative faculties of the mind including the ability to embrace mystery, wonderment, and inquiry. There is also concern for the potential loss of creativity. The research that follows attempts to evaluate the impact – both positive and negative – on the domain of language expression including reading, writing, and faculties for imagination and critical thinking. Through thorough examination of neuroscience, trends in reading and writing, usage of electronic communications, social media and politics, levels of digital literacy, primary observations of high school students in a tech-dependent classroom, the evaluations that follow form a basis for theoretical assumptions about technology’s impact on language expression and education.}

By combining a modular computer programming language with a modular building platform, LEGO Education has allowed students (of all ages) to become active leaders in their own education as they build everything from animals for a robotic zoo to robots that play children’s games. Most importantly, it allows all students to develop different solutions to the same problem to provide a learning community. We look first at how the recent developments in the learning sciences can help in promoting student learning in robotics. We then share four case studies of successful college-level implementations that build on these developments.}

abstract = {Background/Context This paper is a part of the special issue “Reimagining Research and Practice at the Crossroads of Philosophy, Teaching, and Teacher Education.” We center what follows on a practice used in undergraduate methods courses that we have termed Interruptions. Interruptions are a form of inter-class visitation in which faculty plan together, visit one another’s classes, and publicly interrupt the teaching of the other with a variety of both pre-planned and spontaneous questions relating to the day’s lesson. Research Design We weave together a conceptual analysis and qualitative research, drawing from a larger qualitative study conducted in one early childhood and one elementary undergraduate math methods course in Spring 2016. For the study, we co-planned eight lessons together (four in each course), and observed one another teach each of those lessons, while taking notes and purposely interrupting instruction. We collected survey data from students at the end of each classroom observation and interviewed two students from each class at the end of the term. We also kept reflective journals of our work. In this paper we deploy a narrative format to document teacher inquiry drawing upon our reflective journals and classroom observation to describe the development, enactment, and our response to Interruptions. Outcomes Our use of Interruptions pushed us to examine our own philosophical beliefs and how they were, or were not, enacted in our teaching practice. We highlight that the connections that emerged between philosophy and teacher education provided us with the necessary time to care for our ethical selves both in and out of the classroom. Specifically, we share how this exercise allowed us each to become more deliberately reflective about the work that we do and why and how we do it. Conclusions/Recommendations In addition to giving us time to slow down our teaching in order to think carefully about our choices while in the midst of teaching, we found that we also considered instructional implications long after the Interruptions were complete. Interruptions helped us think more deliberately about the ethical choices we made as educators and in the service of our students. Interruptions proved to have deep and long-lasting effects on our practice as teacher educators. Other practitioners who ground themselves in both philosophy and methods may benefit from similarly systematic approaches for examining their own practice with an eye towards improvements in teaching and understanding of the self.}

abstract = {Purpose There is limited scholarship on artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education governance, despite the growing prevalence of AI-powered technologies in many fields, including education. However, as the technology is still nascent and has yet to reach its full potential, ideas and arguments abound, championing or cautioning against the use of these technologies. Design/Approach/Methods To fill this gap in research on policy networks and AI in British higher education, this article employs network ethnography and discourse analysis to study how ideas about AI-powered technologies in higher education circulate in policy networks in the United Kingdom. Findings The findings evidence a policy network showing signs of a heterarchy permeated by neoliberal rationales and populated by policy actors actively promoting artificial intelligence technologies to be used in education. Originality/Value This paper builds on existing research by looking at the university and not-for-profit sectors, in addition to the governmental and educational technology sectors. Using network ethnography, this article expands our understanding of the policy actors involved and critically analyzes ideas regarding the use of AI in education.}

The damage can be load oriented, microstructure oriented, or (for the first time within this modeling framework) softening. The local equations are solved using a combination of fixed-point and Newton–Raphson algorithms, whose efficiencies are drastically improved through Aitken’s relaxation and BFGS approximation. A delay-effect method is used to control the localization of damage, which leads to an objective calculation of the final rupture of structures.}

abstract = {Purpose: Rotary blood pumps are a promising treatment approach for patients with a total cavopulmonary connection and a failing cardiovascular system. The aim of this study was to investigate the hemodynamic effects of cavopulmonary support using a numerical model with closed-loop baroreflex and exercise mechanisms. Methods: A numerical model of the univentricular cardiovascular system was developed, mimicking the hemodynamics during rest and exercise. Rotary blood pumps with different hydraulic pump characteristics (flat vs steep pressure-flow relationships) were investigated in the cavopulmonary position. Furthermore, two support modes—a constant speed setting and a physiologically controlled speed—were examined. Results: Hemodynamics without rotary blood pumps were achieved with less than 10% deviation from reported values during rest and exercise. Rotary blood pumps at constant speed improve the hemodynamics at rest, however, they constitute a hydraulic resistance during light (steep characteristics) or moderate (flat characteristics) exercise. In contrast, physiologic control increases cardiac output (moderate exercise: 8.2 vs 7.4 L/min) and reduces sympathetic activation (heart rate at moderate exercise: 111 vs 123 bpm). Conclusion: In this simulation study, the necessity of an automatically controlled rotary blood pump in the cavopulmonary position was shown. A pump at constant speed might constitute an additional resistance to venous return during physical activity. Therefore, a physiologic control algorithm based on the pressure difference between the caval veins and the atrial pressure is proposed to improve hemodynamics, especially during physical activity.}

Industry 4.0 calls for transformation and effective talent development is vital in ensuring national aspirations are achieved while eliminating redundancy and ensuring consistency. As such, this study aims to understand the impact of Industry 4.0 on computer engineering-related workforce and skills development within Multinational Companies (MNCs) to Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia. In this study, online questionnaires were distributed to evaluate the current and future hiring trends. The study reveals that most of the employees have positive perceptions about the industrial current practice on Industry 4.0 and identified the prospective demands on the professions that will be affected. Five significant areas of required competencies found in this study are adaptability, soft skills, software engineering, data analytics, and technical skills. The findings provide empirical evidence about current and future employment scenarios in Malaysia concerning the possible impact of Industry 4.0 on the companies and issues involved in managing the transition to Industry 4.0. Besides, the emergent skills required by workforces that are previously unaddressed in the literature were identified. Empirical evidence from the analysis contributes to shaping the educational systems of the future and helps to proactively identify specific skills shortages at an early stage.}

abstract = {From 1980 to 1991, Kyriacou, Hall, and collaborators (K&H) reported that the Drosophila melanogaster courtship song has a 1-min cycle in the length of mean interpulse intervals (IPIs) that is modulated by circadian rhythm period mutations. In 2014, Stern failed to replicate these results using a fully automated method for detecting song pulses. Manual annotation of Stern’s song records exposed a ~50% error rate in detection of IPIs, but the corrected data revealed period-dependent IPI cycles using a variety of statistical methods. In 2017, Stern et al. dismissed the sine/cosine method originally used by K&H to detect significant cycles, claiming that randomized songs showed as many significant values as real data using cosinor analysis. We first identify a simple mathematical error in Stern et al.’s cosinor implementation that invalidates their critique of the method. Stern et al. also concluded that although the manually corrected wild-type and perL mutant songs show similar periods to those observed by K&H, each song is usually not significantly rhythmic by the Lomb-Scargle (L-S) periodogram, so any genotypic effect simply reflects “noise.” Here, we observe that L-S is extremely conservative compared with 3 other time-series analyses in assessing the significance of rhythmicity, both for conventional locomotor activity data collected in equally spaced time bins and for unequally spaced song records. Using randomization of locomotor and song data to generate confidence limits for L-S instead of the theoretically derived values, we find that L-S is now consistent with the other methods in determining significant rhythmicity in locomotor and song records and that it confirms period-dependent song cycles. We conclude that Stern and colleagues’ failure to identify song cycles stems from the limitations of automated methods in accurately reflecting song parameters, combined with the use of an overly stringent method to discriminate rhythmicity in courtship songs.}

abstract = {This paper presents the use of a computational design algorithm in combination with robotic fabrication and sensing to augment the design and construction process for non-standardized material. Although reusing reclaimed material can significantly reduce the environmental impact in building construction, current design processes are not set up for this shift in thinking. Contrary to conventional practices, designing within the constraints of available material means that geometry and topology cannot be fully pre-determined. This paper introduces a design methodology for corrugated shell structures from folded sheet metal of variable geometries and properties, in which the design goal adapts to available material. It follows a two-fold approach of digital algorithm development and scanning and physical prototyping for robotic fabrication. The scanned materials database is classified based on object geometry data and material properties; such as thickness, type of metal, and spring-back values for fabrication purposes. Together with a target surface, it is an input for a generative design algorithm consisting of surface generation and optimization. The surface generation tries to approximate the target through a translation of search algorithm results for object placement into a 2D mesh graph which is then linked to 3D particle spring based form-finding. The optimization consists of evaluation of structural, fabrication, and design criteria, with finally user selection. Robotic fabrication included object recognition, metal sheet folding and consideration of different metal spring back behavior. These methods were tested on a single curved arch surface and applied to a double curved cantilever canopy as a final demonstrator. The algorithm results showed a generation of different corrugated shell topologies based on iterated object placement. As a demonstrator, a part of the selected canopy was robotically fabricated from local industrial leftovers.}

abstract = {Abstract Increasing demand from the consumer for higher levels of refinement from their passenger vehicles has put considerable pressure on the automotive industry to produce ever quieter cars. In order to prevent the occurrence of many forms of brake noise, especially judder and drone, excessive heating of the brake disc must be avoided, while minimizing temperature variations across the rotor. In order for this to be achieved the brake rotor must be designed such that it ensures sufficient uniform heat dissipation and thermal capacity. In high-demand braking applications, vented discs consisting of two rubbing surfaces separated by straight radial vanes are normally employed, as they utilize a greater surface area to dissipate heat. Within this paper the effects of changing the geometry of the first row of pins on aerothermo-dynamic properties of a pin-vented brake rotor are investigated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The validated CFD model shows that decreasing the thickness of the first row of pins by 10 per cent improves the mass flowrate through the rotor by 14 per cent and the heat transfer rate by 6 per cent. The results obtained can be used for the design of brake discs which are efficient with respect to heat dissipation.}

abstract = {Wind energy extraction is one of the fastest developing engineering branches today. Number of installed wind turbines is constantly increasing. Appropriate solutions for urban environments are quiet, structurally simple and affordable small-scale vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs). Due to small efficiency, particularly in low and variable winds, main topic here is development of optimal flow concentrator that locally augments wind velocity, facilitates turbine start and increases generated power. Conceptual design was performed by combining finite volume method and artificial intelligence (AI). Smaller set of computational results (velocity profiles induced by existence of different concentrators in flow field) was used for creation, training and validation of several artificial neural networks. Multi-objective optimization of concentrator geometric parameters was realized through coupling of generated neural networks with genetic algorithm. Final solution from the acquired Pareto set is studied in more detail. Resulting computed velocity field is illustrated. Aerodynamic performances of small-scale VAWT with and without optimal flow concentrator are estimated and compared. The performed research demonstrates that, with use of flow concentrator, average increase in wind speed of 20%–25% can be expected. It also proves that contemporary AI techniques can significantly facilitate and accelerate design processes in the field of wind engineering.}

abstract = {The ball mill is usually the largest energy consumer at a mine site and significantly affects operational expenditures. Given a target particle size, Bond Mill Work Index estimates are used to predict a ball mill’s throughput. In order to maximize ball mill throughput and optimize energy utilization, it is important to get these estimates right. At the Tropicana Gold Mine, Work Index estimates, derived from X-Ray Fluorescence and Hyperspectral scanning of Grade Control samples, are used to construct spatial GeoMetallurgical models (GeoMet). Inaccuracies in block estimates exist due to limited calibration between grade control derived and laboratory Work Index values. To improve the calibration, an updating algorithm has been tested at the Tropicana Gold Mine. The aim of the study was to demonstrate a new process for updating block estimates using actual mill performance data. Deviations between predicted and actual mill performance are monitored and used to locally improve the Work Index estimates in the GeoMet model. The updating algorithm improves the spatial Work Index estimates, resulting in a real-time reconciliation of already extracted blocks and a recalibration of future scheduled blocks. The case study shows that historic and future production estimates improve on average by about 72 and 26%.}

abstract = {Compared with the traditional in-cylinder direct-injection spark ignition engine, the side-injection and side-spark-ignition characteristics of the two-stroke opposed-piston engine increase the ignition kernel offset and flame propagation distance. Increasing the flame propagation speed can to some extent solve the drawbacks caused by the non-central arrangement of spark plugs. The combustion chamber structure plays a crucial role in gas flow, fuel-charge mixing, and combustion characteristics. Therefore, three pistons were designed and comparatively analyzed in this study. The results show that: The pancake piston is beneficial to maintaining the intake swirl strength due to its simple and smooth spherical arc structure. The swirl strength of the pit and pit-guided piston decreases obviously, and the tumble strength can be maintained well. Compared to pancake and pit-guided pistons, the average TKE for the pit piston increased by approximately 25%, with a more concentrated distribution at the spark timing. The pancake piston exhibits the best scavenging performance, reducing the residual exhaust gas ratio by 2.1% and fresh air loss by 3.3% to the pit piston. A stable ignition core can be formed at the spark timing, but significant differences are observed in the flame propagation process for three pistons. Compared to the pit-guided piston, the pit piston has a 0.3% decrease in the indicated thermal efficiency, but a 13.1% decrease in combustion duration, which reduces knock tendency.}
