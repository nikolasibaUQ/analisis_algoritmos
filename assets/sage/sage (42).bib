abstract = {Abstract A three-dimensional, multi-phase, non-isothermal computational fluid dynamics model of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell has been developed to simulate the hygro and thermal stresses in polymer membrane, which developed during the cell operation. The behaviour of the membrane during the operation of a unit cell has been studied and investigated. The model accounts for both gas and liquid phase in the same computational domain, and thus allows for the implementation of phase change inside the gas diffusion layers. The model includes the transport of gaseous species, liquid water, protons, energy, and water dissolved in the ion-conducting polymer. The new feature of the present model is to incorporate the effect of hygro and thermal stresses into actual three-dimensional, multi-phase, non-isothermal fuel cell model. In addition to hygro—thermal stresses, the model features an algorithm that allows for a more realistic representation of the local activation overpotentials, which leads to improved prediction of the local current density distribution in high accuracy, and therefore, high accuracy prediction of temperature distribution in the cell and then thermal stresses. This model also takes into account convection and diffusion of different species in the channels as well as in the porous gas diffusion layer, heat transfer in the solids as well as in the gases, and electrochemical reactions.}

We assess one dominant strategy within the social sciences that takes a computer-led approach to text analysis. The approach is coined computational grounded theory. This strategy, we argue, relies on a set of unwarranted assumptions, namely, that unsupervised models return natural clusters of meaning, that the researcher can understand text with limited immersion and that indirect validation is sufficient for ensuring unbiased and precise measurement. In response to this criticism, we develop a framework that is computer assisted. We argue that our reformulation of computational grounded theory better aligns with the principles within grounded theory, anthropological theory generation and ethnography.}

abstract = {In this study, a computational model is developed using finite-element techniques within a continuum micromechanics framework to capture the effect of electron-hopping-induced conductive paths at the nanoscale which contribute to the macroscale piezoresistive response of the nanocomposite. This is achieved by tracking the position of the nanotubes under applied deformations and modifying the conductivity of the intertube region depending on the relative proximity of individual pairs of nanotubes. The formation and disruption of the electron-hopping pathways are highly dependent on intertube distances and under deformations can result in microstructural rearrangements in terms of electrostatic properties leading to transitions in material symmetries and component magnitudes of the effective electrostatic properties. Thus, in order to capture the complexities of changing inhomogeneous nanoscale electrostatic behavior, where analytical Eshelby’s approaches cannot be used, a computational micromechanics model is needed. The effective conductivity and piezoresistive strain tensor coefficients are evaluated using volume-averaged energy equivalencies for aligned CNT–polymer nanocomposites in the transverse direction exploring different volume fractions of CNTs in the polymer and the maximum electron-hopping range. The impact of the electron-hopping mechanism on the effective piezoresistive response is studied through the macroscale effective gauge factors under different loading conditions. The effective piezoresistive strain coefficients and macroscale effective gauge factors are observed to be nonlinear with applied macroscale strain and are highly dependent on the type of boundary conditions. The effective macroscale gauge factors observed in the current study have magnitudes comparable to experimental observations reported in the literature with higher gauge factors observed closer to the percolation threshold.}

abstract = {In the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry, waste is oft framed as an economic problem typically addressed in a building’s construction and demolition phase. Yet, architectural design decision-making can significantly determine construction waste outcomes. Following the logic of zero waste, this research addresses waste minimisation ‘at the source’. By resituating the problem of construction waste within the architectural design process, the research explores waste as a data and informational problem in a design system. Accordingly, this article outlines the creation of an integrated computational design decision support waste tool that employs a novel data structure combining HTML-scraped material data and historic building information modelling (BIM) data to generate waste evaluations in a browser-based 3D modelling platform. Designing an accessible construction waste tool for use by architects and designers aims to heighten awareness of the waste implications of design decisions towards challenging the systems of consumption and production that generate construction and demolition waste.}

abstract = {Despite the evolution of ventricular assist devices, ventricular assist device patients still suffer from complications due to the damage to blood by fluid dynamic stress. Since rotary ventricular assist devices are assumed to exert mainly shear stress, studies of blood damage are based on shear flow experiments. However, measurements and simulations of cell and protein deformation show normal and shear stresses deform, and potentially damage, cells and proteins differently. The aim was to use computational fluid dynamics to assess the prevalence of normal stress, in comparison with shear stress, in rotary ventricular assist devices. Our calculations showed normal stresses do occur in rotary ventricular assist devices: the fluid volumes experiencing normal stress above 10 Pa were 0.011 mL (0.092%) and 0.027 mL (0.39%) for the HeartWare HVAD and HeartMate II (HMII), and normal stresses over 100 Pa were present. However, the shear stress volumes were up to two orders of magnitude larger than the normal stress volumes. Considering thresholds for red blood cell and von Willebrand factor deformation by normal and shear stresses, the fluid volumes causing deformation by normal stress were between 2.5 and 5 times the size of those causing deformation by shear stress. The exposure times to the individual normal stress deformation regions were around 1 ms. The results clearly show, for the first time, that while blood within rotary ventricular assist devices experiences more shear stress at much higher magnitudes as compared with normal stress, there is sufficient normal stress exposure present to cause deformation of, and potentially damage to, the blood components. This study is the first to quantify the fluid stress components in real blood contacting devices.}

abstract = {In this study, a computational fluid dynamics analysis was performed on bio-inspired micro aerial vehicle scale rigid flapping wings. The computational fluid dynamics analysis used a compressible unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes solver with low-Mach number preconditioning to study the complex, highly vortical, three-dimensional flow of low aspect ratio flapping wings at micro aerial vehicle-scale Reynolds numbers. The wing was flapped at a constant 5 Hz flap frequency at a mean chord reference Reynolds number of 25,000. The flapping and pitching kinematics were set to match those of a previous experimental study resulting in a constant flap stroke of 107° at translational pitching angles of 40°, 50°, and 60°. The force and flowfield measurements of the previous flapping-wing experiment were used for the validation of the 3D computational fluid dynamics model. The objectives of this effort were to understand the unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms and their relation to force production and aerodynamic efficiency on a rigid wing undergoing an insect-type flapping motion with passive pitching kinematics. Overall, the computational fluid dynamics results showed good agreement with the measured experimental force data. Additionally, the computational fluid dynamics simulation was able to adequately predict the process of leading edge vortex formation and shedding observed during experimentation. A vorticity summation approach used to calculate the strength of the leading edge vortex from the experimental measurements and from the computational fluid dynamics predicted flowfields showed comparable results. The computational fluid dynamics results were utilized to further analyze the differences in the flowfield and leading edge vortex formation for the three pitch angles tested as well as the instantaneous aerodynamic loads and aerodynamic power.}

abstract = {In recent years, the triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS)-based scaffolds have been served as one of the crucial types of structures for biological replacements, the energy absorber, etc. Meanwhile, the development of additive manufacturing (AM) has facilitated the production of TPMS scaffolds with complex microstructures. However, the design maps of TPMS scaffolds, especially considering the AM constraints, remain unclear, which has hindered the design and application of TPMS scaffolds. The aims of the present study were to develop an efficient computational modeling framework for investigating the design maps of TPMS scaffolds simultaneously considering the AM constraints, the biological requirements, and the structural anisotropy. To demonstrate the computational framework, five widely-used topologies of the TPMS-based scaffolds (i.e. the Diamond, the Gyroid, the Fischer-Koch S, the F-RD, and the Schwarz P) were used, whose design maps for the surface-to-volume ratio and the effective elastic modulus were also investigated. The results showed that as the porosities increase, the design ranges of the surface-to-volume ratios decreases for all the structures. Compared with the effect of the constraint for the pore size, the minimal structural thickness for AM constraint has a greater effect on the surface-to-volume ratio. Regarding the elastic modulus, in the region of low porosity (approximately 0.5–0.7), the range for the effective elastic modulus of Schwarz P is the widest (approximately 2.24–32.6 GPa), but the Gyroid can achieve both high porosity and low effective elastic modulus (e.g. 0.61 GPa at the porosity of 0.90). These results and the method developed in the present study provided important basis and guidance for the design and application of the TPMS-based porous structures.}

The aim was to compare how the orifice area and leaflet orientation affect the hemodynamics of a pure bicuspid valve. By applying physiologic material properties and boundary conditions, blood flow shear stresses were predicted during peak systole. A reduced orifice area altered blood velocity, the pressure drop across the valve and the wall shear stress through the valve. Bicuspid models predicted impaired blood flow similar to a stenotic valve, but the flow patterns were specific to leaflet orientation. Flow patterns developed in bicuspid aortic valves, such as helical flow, were sensitive to cusp orientation. In conclusion, the reduced opening area of a bicuspid aortic valve amplifies any impaired hemodynamics, but cusp orientation determines subsequent flow patterns which may determine the specific regions downstream from the valve most at risk of clinical complications.}

Major potential contributions of CL methodologies (e.g., word embeddings, interpretational frameworks) for deepening that theoretical understanding of suicide behaviors and promoting the personalized approach in psychological assessment are presented as well. We also discuss principal ethical and methodological obstacles in CL suicide prevention, such as the difficulty to maintain people’s privacy/safety or interpret the “black box” of prediction algorithms. Ethical guidelines and practical methodological recommendations addressing these obstacles are provided for future researchers and clinicians.}

abstract = {In recent years, the use of machine learning-based surrogate models for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations has emerged as a promising technique for reducing the computational cost associated with engine design optimization. However, such methods still suffer from drawbacks. One main disadvantage is that the default machine learning (ML) hyperparameters are often severely suboptimal for a given problem. This has often been addressed by manually trying out different hyperparameter settings, but this solution is ineffective in case of a high-dimensional hyperparameter space. Besides this problem, the amount of data needed for training is also not known a priori. In response to these issues that need to be addressed, the present work describes and validates an automated active learning approach, AutoML-GA, for surrogate-based optimization of internal combustion engines. In this approach, a Bayesian optimization technique is used to find the best machine learning hyperparameters based on an initial dataset obtained from a small number of CFD simulations. Subsequently, a genetic algorithm is employed to locate the design optimum on the ML surrogate surface. In the vicinity of the design optimum, the solution is refined by repeatedly running CFD simulations at the projected optima and adding the newly obtained data to the training dataset. It is demonstrated that AutoML-GA leads to a better optimum with a lower number of CFD simulations, compared to the use of default hyperparameters. The proposed framework offers the advantage of being a more hands-off approach that can be readily utilized by researchers and engineers in industry who do not have extensive machine learning expertise.}

The successful development of these simulations is aided by attention to sound software project management and software engineering. We have developed “lessons learned” from a set of code projects that the Department of Energy National Nuclear Security Agency has sponsored to develop nuclear weapons simulations over the last 50 years. We find that some, but not all, of the software project management and development practices (rather than processes) commonly employed for non-technical software add value to the development of scientific software and we identify those that we judge add value. Another key finding, consistent with general software industry experience, is that the optimal project schedule and resource level are solely determined by the requirements once the requirements are fixed.}

Our objective was to use computational fluid dynamics to alter fluid and artery wall properties, to simulate scenarios causative of significantly elevated arterial blood velocities. Two-dimensional simulations were created and increasing percent stenoses were created in silico, with their locations varied among middle cerebral artery (MCA), internal carotid artery (ICA), and anterior cerebral artery (ACA). Stenoses placed in the MCA, ICA, or ACA generated local increases in velocity, but not sufficient to reach magnitudes > 200 cm/s, even up to 75% stenosis. Three-dimensional reconstructions of the MCA, ICA, and ACA from children with SCA were generated from magnetic resonance angiograms. Using finite element method, blood flow was simulated with realistic velocity waveforms to the ICA inlet. Three-dimensional reconstructions revealed an uneven, internal arterial wall surface in children with SCA and higher mean velocities in the MCA up to 145 cm/s compared to non-SCA reconstructions. There were also greater areas of flow recirculation and larger regions of low wall shear stress. Taken together, these bumps on the internal wall of the cerebral arteries could create local flow disturbances that, in aggregate, could elevate blood velocities in SCA. Identifying cellular causes of these microstructures as adhered blood cells or luminal narrowing due to endothelial hyperplasia induced by disturbed flow would provide new targets to treat children with SCA. The preliminary qualitative results provided here point out the critical role of 3D reconstruction of patient-specific vascular geometries and provide qualitative insight to complex interplay between vascular geometry and rheological properties possibly altered by SCA.}

Marketers, for example, may recommend a certain colour for a new soda can because it “pops” on Instagram; politicians may “fine-tune” diction for different social demographics. This paper engages the need to strategise for such resonance by offering a method for automating opposition analysis (OA), a technique from semiotics used in marketing and literary analysis to plot objects of interest on oppositional axes. Central to our computational approach is a reframing of texts as proxies for thought and opposition as the product of oscillation in thought in response to those proxies, a model to which the contextual similarity information contained in word embeddings is relevant. We illustrate our approach with an analysis of texts on gun control from ProCon.org, implementing a three-step method to: 1) identify relatively prominent signifiers; 2) rank possible opposition pairs on prominence and contextual similarity scores; and 3) derive plot values for proxies on opposition pair axes. The results are discussed in terms of strategies for informal argument that might be derived by those on each side of gun control.}

The flow field is computed by solving unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (uRANS) equations coupled with SST k-ω turbulence model and Gamma-Theta transition model. Validation involved comparing CFD-predicted integral quantities, static pressure distributions, and loads with corresponding experimental values demonstrating reasonably good agreement at all three wind speeds. Overall, SRF exhibited slightly better wake predictions (hypothetical), while MRF predictions were closer to measurements for integral quantities, static pressure and loads. This study demonstrates the utility of uRANS-based 3D CFD computations in wind turbine aerodynamics studies.}

abstract = {Over the past decade, the ever-increasing energy demands of IT infrastructures have posed significant challenges for the research community in terms of reducing their total power consumption and minimizing their environmental impact. Optical communication networks are envisioned to be promising candidates to help preventing this problem affecting the Internet backbone, as well as for distributed applications such as computational grids. In this paper, we propose an adaptive and distributed scheme for the establishment of energy-efficient lightpaths in computational grids. The grid is deployed over an optical circuit-switched backbone network, defining an optical grid network. Each node of the backbone network maintains two different dynamic thresholds values and estimates the changes in network performance by evaluating the moving average of the total wavelength channel occupancy on all its input/output links. The nodes have the ability of reducing the energy consumption by entering into an Energy Saving Mode (ESM) on the basis of a comparison between their channel occupancy and the thresholds. Furthermore, we extend our framework by allowing the thresholds to be dynamically adapted depending on the network performance in terms of blocking probability. We show that the proposed method achieves considerable energy savings when compared to a normal energy-unaware operational mode and still allows to maintain an acceptable level of network performance in terms of blocking probability and end-to-end delay. Numerical results are obtained with a Java event-driven simulator of two different optical network topologies.}

abstract = {We present results obtained with new instrumental methods for the acoustic analysis of prosody to evaluate prosody production by children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Typical Development (TD). Two tasks elicit focal stress — one in a vocal imitation paradigm, the other in a picture-description paradigm; a third task also uses a vocal imitation paradigm, and requires repeating stress patterns of two-syllable nonsense words. The instrumental methods differentiated significantly between the ASD and TD groups in all but the focal stress imitation task. The methods also showed smaller differences in the two vocal imitation tasks than in the picture-description task, as was predicted. In fact, in the nonsense word stress repetition task, the instrumental methods showed better performance for the ASD group. The methods also revealed that the acoustic features that predict auditory-perceptual judgment are not the same as those that differentiate between groups. Specifically, a key difference between the groups appears to be a difference in the balance between the various prosodic cues, such as pitch, amplitude, and duration, and not necessarily a difference in the strength or clarity with which prosodic contrasts are expressed.}

abstract = {This paper presents the VDM 2000, a computational model of target detection designed for use in military developmental test and evaluation settings. The model integrates research results from the fields of early vision, object recognition, and psychophysics. The VDM2000 is image based and provides a criterion-independent measure of target conspicuity, referred to as the vehicle metric (VM). A large data set of human responses to photographs of military vehicles in a field setting was used to validate the model. The VM adjusted by a single calibration parameter accounts for approximately 80% of the variance in the validation data. The primary application of this model is to predict detection of military targets in daylight with the unaided eye. The model also has application to target detection prediction using infrared night vision systems. The model has potential as a tool to evaluate the visual properties of more general task settings.}

abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigate the use of computational fluid dynamics in predicting the performance and geometry of the optimal design of a steam ejector used in a steam turbine. Many scholars have analysed the steam ejector using the ideal gas model, which lacks accuracy in terms of calculating the flow field of the ejector. This study is reported in a series of two papers. The first part covers the validation of CFX 11.0 results using different equations of state (EOS) on the converging–diverging nozzle flow field carried out with the experimental value. The IAPWS IF97 real gas model works well with the experimental value. The flow field of the ejector was analysed using different EOS after grid-dependent learning. The results show that the performance of the ejector was underestimated under the ideal gas model; the entrainment ratio was 20–40 per cent lower than when using the real gas model. The effect of the optimal geometrical design and operating conditions will be discussed in Part 2.}
