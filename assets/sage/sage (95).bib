abstract = {Teaching programming and creating games have attracted much attention over the years, mostly the attention of curriculum developers and teachers. This study designed and developed a video game-based intervention, then investigated the effects of this intervention on middle school students’ learning of probability concepts. In the study, the students learned and used Scratch as a game programming tool. Initially, they received hands-on learning activities on how to use Scratch, and then developed video games based on scenarios authored by the researchers. The study collected quantitative as well as qualitative data using two different measurement tools: probability achievement test and student project assessment rubric, respectively. The data revealed that students were able to learn and use Scratch and develop probability-related and probability-based algorithms that generate random results successfully. The effect of Scratch intervention on students’ learning of probability was statistically significant. Findings were discussed in relation to similar studies reported in the literature. Finally, the study raised a set of further research questions in the Conclusion section.}

abstract = {Central government guidance seeks to ensure and enhance the quality of practice and decision-making across – and sometimes beyond – government. The Magenta Book, published by HM Treasury, is the key UK Government resource on policy evaluation, setting out central government guidance on how to evaluate policies, projects and programmes. The UK Centre for the Evaluation of Complexity Across the Nexus was invited to contribute its expertise to the UK Government’s 2020 update of the Magenta Book by developing an accompanying guide on policy evaluation and ‘complexity’. A small multidisciplinary team worked together to produce a set of guidance, going through multiple stages of work and drawing on a variety of sources including academic and practitioner literature and experts and stakeholders in the fields of evaluation, policy and complexity. It also drew on Centre for the Evaluation of Complexity Across the Nexus’ own work developing and testing evaluation methods for dealing with complexity in evaluation. The resulting Magenta Book 2020 Supplementary Guide: Handling Complexity in Policy Evaluation explores the implications of complexity for policy and evaluation and how evaluation can help to navigate complexity. This article, designed primarily for practitioners who might be interested in this guidance and how it was developed, describes the processes involved, particularly related to the interdisciplinary dialogue and consultation with other key stakeholders that this involved. It also briefly outlines the content and key messages in the guidance, with reflections on the experiences of the authors in developing the guide – including the challenges and insights that arose during the process, particularly around the challenges of communicating complexity to a broad audience of readers.}

The availability and usage of big data by organizations is an issue of emerging importance, raising new and old themes for diverse commentators and researchers to investigate. Drawing on sensemaking, learning, and complexity perspectives, this article highlights four key challenges to be addressed if organizations are to engage the phenomenon of big data effectively and reflexively: responding to the dynamic complexity of big data in terms of “simplexity,” analyzing big data using interdisciplinary processes, responsible reflection on ideologies of learning and knowledge production when handling big data, and mutually aligning sensemaking with big data topics to map domains of application. This article concludes with additional implications arising from considering sensemaking in conjunction with big data analytics as a critical way of understanding unique aspects of learning and technology in the 21st century.}

abstract = {Heart failure is a major health risk, and with limited availability of donor organs, there is an increasing need for developing cardiac assist devices (CADs). Mock circulatory loops (MCL) are an important in-vitro test platform for CAD’s performance assessment and optimisation. The MCL is a lumped parameter model constructed out of hydraulic and mechanical components aiming to simulate the native cardiovascular system (CVS) as closely as possible. Further development merged MCLs and numerical circulatory models to improve flexibility and accuracy of the system; commonly known as hybrid MCLs. A total of 128 MCLs were identified in a literature research until 25 September 2020. It was found that the complexity of the MCLs rose over the years, recent MCLs are not only capable of mimicking the healthy and pathological conditions, but also implemented cerebral, renal and coronary circulations and autoregulatory responses. Moreover, the development of anatomical models made flow visualisation studies possible. Mechanical MCLs showed excellent controllability and repeatability, however, often the CVS was overly simplified or lacked autoregulatory responses. In numerical MCLs the CVS is represented with a higher order of lumped parameters compared to mechanical test rigs, however, complex physiological aspects are often simplified. In hybrid MCLs complex physiological aspects are implemented in the hydraulic part of the system, whilst the numerical model represents parts of the CVS that are too difficult to represent by mechanical components per se. This review aims to describe the advances, limitations and future directions of the three types of MCLs.}

Warhammer 40,000 is the market dominator of the nondigital tabletop wargame genre. In this article, we perform a ludological analysis of the process of preparing, or drafting, an army for a competitive Warhammer 40,000 tournament. We find that there are four interrelated categories of resources that influence this fundamentally playful process. Our results indicate that this process of preparation constitutes a core component of the appeal of Warhammer 40,000. This emphasizes the importance of understanding the diverse activities that go into gameplay that often exceed the computer game “client” or board of play. We suggest the category of engagement pastime to encapsulate these extended, ongoing elements of Warhammer 40,000’s appeal, which we define as a collection of interlinked and associated activities that serve to occupy one’s time and thoughts pleasantly.}

Drawing on a technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework informed by prior research on (language) teacher education and computer-assisted language learning, this study examines how preservice teachers described their knowledge base specifically related to using digital tools equitably with multilingual learners. Qualitative analysis of 17 preservice teachers’ course discussions, assignments, and interviews revealed that preservice teachers purposefully reflected on and selected digital tools to use that would support students’ language development and leverage students’ interests. They also reflected on structural inequities and advocacy related to technological implementation. This study encourages teacher educators to support preservice teachers in developing technologically savvy practices that are also linguistically responsive and humanizing by centering equity in TPACK.}

abstract = {This paper draws on the notion of the asset to better understand the role of innovative research technologies in researchers’ practices and decisions. Faced with both the need to accumulate academic capital to make a living in academia and with many uncertainties about the future, researchers must find ways to anticipate future academic revenues. We illustrate that innovative research technologies provide a suitable means for doing so: First, because they promise productivity through generating interesting data and hence publications. Second, because they allow a signaling of innovativeness in contexts where research is evaluated, even across disciplinary boundaries. As such, enrolling innovative research technologies as assets allows researchers to bridge partly conflicting valuations of productivity and innovativeness they are confronted with. However, the employment of innovative technologies in anticipation of future academic revenues is not always aligned with what researchers value epistemically. Nevertheless, considerations about potential future academic revenues derived from innovative research technologies sometimes seem to override particular epistemic valuations. Illustrating these dynamics, we show that processes of assetization in academia can have significant epistemic consequences which are important to unpack.}

abstract = {Computer programming is a difficult course for many students. Prior works advocated for group learning pedagogies in pursuit of higher-level reasoning and conceptual understanding. However, the methodological gaps in existing implementations warrant further research. This study conducted a three-armed cluster-randomized controlled trial to comparatively evaluate the social and cognitive effects of group learning pedagogies in computer programming. Following an apprenticeship model, each group has a designated master: drivers in pair programming (PP), peer leaders in peer-led team learning (PLTL), and practitioners in practitioner-assisted group learning (PAGL). In all course deliverables, the PP group received the lowest mean scores. Meanwhile, no significant difference was found between the PLTL and PAGL groups. Except for psychological safety, social factors such as task cohesion, interdependence, and group potency were significantly different between the groups. Both PLTL and PAGL groups reported a significant increase in social factors after 14 weeks of intervention. These findings provide a rationale for educational leaders and teachers to formulate curricular plans that integrate PLTL and PAGL in computer programming education. Overall, this study contributes to the literature on group learning, expands the pedagogies in computer programming, and serves as additional empirical evidence on cognitive apprenticeship and sociocultural perspectives of learning.}

The flow is modelled by the three-dimensional Favre-Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations using the Launder-Sharma near-wall k-ɛ turbulence closure, which are integrated using an implicit third-order upwind solver. The computation models the eight blade rows, including the tip clearance gaps of the rotors, using a 6 × 106 points grid, and computes the time-averaged flow using mixing planes between rows. Computational results are compared with measurements for various operating points. After this validation the method is used in a first attempt to analyse the three-dimensional flow at reduced-mass-flow operation.}

abstract = {Condition-based monitoring (CBM) has advanced to the stage where industry is now demanding machinery that possesses self-diagnosis ability. This need has spurred the CBM research to be applicable in more expanded areas over the past decades. There are two critical issues in implementing CBM in harsh environments using embedded systems: computational efficiency and adaptability. In this paper, a computationally efficient and adaptive approach including simple principal component analysis (SPCA) for feature dimensionality reduction and K-means clustering for classification is proposed for online embedded machinery diagnosis. Compared with the standard principal component analysis (PCA) and kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), SPCA is adaptive in nature and has lower algorithm complexity when dealing with a large amount of data. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is firstly validated using a standard rolling element bearing test dataset on a personal computer. It is then deployed on an embedded real-time controller and used to monitor a rotating shaft. It was found that the proposed approach scaled well, whereas the standard PCA-based approach broke down when data quantity increased to a certain level. Furthermore, the proposed approach achieved 90% accuracy when diagnosing an induced fault compared to 59% accuracy obtained using the standard PCA-based approach.}

Utilizing qualitative data collection and analysis methods, we construct a comparative case study to trace the path of how national discourses—in response to the idea of globalization and initiatives promoting computers in education—were translated into policy goals, strategic implementation plans, and teaching and learning practices and outcomes. We document the role of the selected information and communication technology’s materiality in terms of portability and connectivity along this translation path. Our findings point to the importance of considering national discourse, often overlooked in information and communication technology in education studies, when examining initiative success and failure, and of conceptualizing materiality as more than merely the infrastructural foundation upon which information and communication technology in education initiatives are built. Understanding the role that materiality plays in interaction with national discourse may be especially important in guiding successful information and communication technology in education initiatives in developing countries, where financial resources are limited.}

However, little is known about the experiences of pre-service teachers who play a key role in educating future generations. This study aimed to address this gap by exploring Finnish pre-service teachers’ conceptions and experiences of data agency in social media environments. Drawing from in-depth interviews of pre-service teachers (N = 14), the analysis revealed that pre-service teachers construct their data agency in terms of social frames and shared social norms, and they also recognize the lack of understanding regarding wider socio-technical systems within which data agencies are situated. This research argues that without a sophisticated understanding of algorithmic governance and commercial use of data, it is unlikely that these future teachers would be prepared to facilitate children’s and youth’s agentive actions in a data-driven society.}
