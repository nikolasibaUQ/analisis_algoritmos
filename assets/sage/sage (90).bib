abstract = {The three-dimensional (3D) printing of polymer matrix composites has attracted considerable attention. However, the addition of filler materials to the extruded polymer matrix results in inner voids within the beads along with larger voids, called intervoids, which are generated between the beads during the 3D printing process. These voids degrade the thermal transport properties of 3D-printed polyether ether ketone (PEEK) and PEEK/carbon-fiber composites. The effects of these pores (i.e., their number, size, and location) on the thermal conductivity of 3D-printed PEEK and a PEEK/carbon-fiber composite were investigated using a multiscale finite element approach. The presence of the carbon fibers mitigated the effect of the pores on the thermal conductivity of the PEEK/carbon-fiber composite, particularly along the longitudinal direction. Moreover, the inner voids had a dominant effect on the PEEK and PEEK/carbon-fiber composite. Finally, the orientation of the intervoids had no effect on the thermal conductivity of the printed materials.}

abstract = {In online social networks, spam profiles represent one of the most serious security threats over the Internet; if they do not stop producing bad advertisements, they can be exploited by criminals for various purposes. This article addresses the nature and the characteristics of spam profiles in a social network like Twitter to improve spam detection, based on a number of publicly available language-independent features. In order to investigate the effectiveness of these features in spam detection, four datasets are extracted for four different language contexts (i.e. Arabic, English, Korean and Spanish), and a fifth is formed by combining them all. We conduct our experiments using a set of five well-known classification algorithms in spam detection field, k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT) (J48) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifiers, along with five filter-based feature selection methods, namely, Information Gain, Chi-square, ReliefF, Correlation and Significance. The results show oscillating performance of each classifier across all datasets, but improved classification results with feature selection. In addition, detailed analysis and comparisons are carried out on two different levels: in the first level, we compare the selected features’ importance among the feature selection methods, whereas in the second level, we observe the relations and the importance of the selected features across all datasets. The findings of this article lead to a better understanding of social spam and improving detection methods by considering the various important features resulting from the different lingual contexts.}

abstract = {Cognitive control refers to the processes by which individual cognitive functions are coordinated in the service of higher-level goals. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the middle front of the brain monitors performance, and it is activated when the need for control increases—for instance, in difficult situations or when errors occur. Since the late 1990s, the ACC has been thought to signal when there is conflict between competing action plans so that the conflict can be resolved. More recently, an alternative model has reconceptualized the role of ACC as that of a predictor and evaluator of the likely outcomes of planned actions before the actions are performed. This new Predicted Response Outcome model accounts for a broader range of findings than the earlier framework and suggests that the ACC might support the cognitive operations by which individuals can “think before they act” in order to avoid risky or otherwise poor choices.}

abstract = {Research on early childhood robotics education often focuses narrowly on teaching young children STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) concepts and skills. In this qualitative case study, our research team examined what happened when we worked with young children (age 7) and combined the technologies of robotics education with an inquiry approach, that is, an opportunity for students to collaboratively identify a problem arising from their own lived experiences and build a robot to solve it. We found that the process of children’s problem identification was dialogic, not only with peers and teachers but also with materials, as they defined and refined problems based on interactions with peers and objects. As this study was conducted at an economically disadvantaged public school in the Southern United States, we argue that early childhood robotics education has a great potential to engage young children in STEM learning in a personally meaningful manner and that an instructional approach fostering children’s inquiry and project-based learning through their problem finding and problem posing is effective in making STEM accessible to students from diverse backgrounds.}

abstract = {Drawing on struggles within academe between faculty that promote critical education and advocates of New Public Management (NPM) who endorse instrumental learning, I reimagine the university as a counter-space that positions it as a counter-power to informational capitalism. Initially, I outline its twin threats: ethical, as self-entrepreneurial academics are valorised by NPM; and political, with informationalisation conflating spaces of thinking. I then detail Scott Lash’s specific account of how the info-comm society negates critique. However, his monistic understanding of informationalisation means Lash’s alternative of Informationskritik risks subsumption by it. I therefore defer to Jacques Derrida’s idea of the university. To ensure the autonomy of the principle of reason in a world of info-comm flows, the university is a supplementary body to society, yet intimately linked to it by its critical reflexivity, which is on behalf of society. Because Derrida does not elaborate the requisite institutional architecture, I conclude with Michel Foucault’s notion of heterotopia as a quasi-illicit site that is different and other. Such an institutional design enables the university as a counter-space that is a bank of reason and an archive of its manifestation in social practices. It also upholds a space for thinking, which in the form of nominalist critical history proffers a counter-power to society as an informational homotopia.}

abstract = {Traditionally, students have demonstrated substantial difficulties in the area of problem solving. Their strategies appear to be limited as they look for key words or rely on gimmicks to assist in the solution of word problems. The process is mindless, inefficient, and ineffective. This area of weakness is especially prevalent in the mildly handicapped population. The importance of problem-solving skills for these students is critical, as they engage not only in mathematical decisions but as they make functional decisions in their daily lives. A sequential hierarchy is presented that establishes a process for students to follow when confronted with problem-solving issues. The step-by-step process enhances student understanding and control. Problem solving becomes planned and deliberate. Implementing the SOLVE strategies enables the teacher to assess and teach the skills and improves students’ success rates.}

While much scholarship supports gamification, labor sociologists have long problematized the phenomenon. In this mixed-methods action research study, we explore the results of gamifying a lesson on gamification in a sociology of work course. We designed two gamified activities with varying degrees of consent that followed a lesson on gamification and consent. Students rated how problematic a series of gamified work scenarios were before and after the intervention. Our quantitative data did not show a significant increase in students’ ability to identify consent after the intervention, but we did discover that students took either an employee or employer’s perspective in their rating justifications. Furthermore, these findings were gendered. This article highlights the need for a more critical take on gamification in the classroom. We conclude by suggesting ways practitioners can teach about gamification in other contexts.}

abstract = {We present a framework for making computation offloading decisions in computational grid settings in which schedulers determine when to move parts of a computation to more capable resources to improve performance. Such schedulers must predict when an offloaded computation will outperform one that is local by forecasting the local cost (execution time for computing locally) and remote cost (execution time for computing remotely and transmission time for the input/output of the computation to/from the remote system). Typically, this decision amounts to predicting the bandwidth between the local and remote systems to estimate these costs. Our framework unifies such decision models by formulating the problem as a statistical decision problem that can either be treated “classically” or using a Bayesian approach. Using an implementation of this framework, we evaluate the efficacy of a number of different decision strategies (several of which have been employed by previous systems). Our results indicate that a Bayesian approach employing automatic change-point detection when estimating the prior distribution is the best performing approach.}

We quantify and describe this property via an analytical exposition highlighting the counterintuitive geometry implied by marginal threshold-setting in multiple dimensions. Recommendations are presented that encourage applied researchers to think jointly, rather than marginally, when setting cutoff scores to ensure an informative test.}

But how are we to engage synergistically with other-than-human life forms and systems? While synergy with animals presents no in-principle difficulty, synergy with larger life systems takes us into epistemological realms explored only in the margins of the Western tradition, such as in Goethe’s Romantic alternative to science.

abstract = {In this paper I explore the possibility that recursion is not part of the cognitive repertoire of non-human primates such as chimpanzees due to limited working memory capacity. Multiple lines of data, from nut cracking to the velocity and duration of cognitive development, imply that chimpanzees have a short-term memory size that limits working memory to dealing with two, or at most three, concepts at a time. If so, as a species they lack the cognitive capacity for recursive thinking to be integrated into systems of social organization and communication. If this limited working memory capacity is projected back to a common ancestor for Pan and Homo, it follows that early hominid ancestors would have had limited working memory capacity. Hence we should find evidence for expansion of working memory capacity during hominid evolution reflected in changes in the products of conceptually framed activities such as stone tool production. Data on the artifacts made by our hominid ancestors support this expansion hypothesis for hominid working memory, thereby leading to qualitative differences between Pan and Homo.}

Here, the main focus is on the details of the computations and the comparison with experimental results for flow in the plenum. Details of the experiment are described elsewhere. By varying mesh density, boundary conditions, discretization schemes and turbulence models, a wide-ranging study of the accuracy of computational techniques for an industrial problem has been made. In particular, levels of mesh refinement for converged numerical solutions have been determined, together with performance levels for the various settings used. In terms of velocity prediction, when the flow is driven by boundary conditions specified at the outlet more accurate results are achieved. This is due to the flow at the inlet being calculated more accurately in these cases. The effects of different discretization schemes and turbulence models on the velocity predictions are small. Pressure predictions are, however, improved by more complex turbulence models such as the renormalization group (RNG) model.}

abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated digitalisation efforts in many countries as they try to contain the virus. With the physical handling of cash posing as a potential virus transmission risk, digital payments have become important in the urgent transition to a cashless society and a key feature of smart city projects. Critical analyses have typically framed smart cities as neoliberalist developmental projects that see the partnering of the state with private corporations. However, it is unclear how the smart city emerges under the technocratic inclinations of the developmental state. Focusing on the digital payments project under Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative, this paper unpacks the discursive practices employed in mobilising citizen support for electronic payments through a critical analysis of publicly available government materials and recent initiatives. The discourse surrounding digital payments is bound up in narratives surrounding economic competitiveness, technological progress and public health and safety, and strongly rooted in a technocratic governance ethos that limits genuine citizen participation in shaping smart payments technologies. This paper argues that such discursive framings represent a missed opportunity to build a smart city that is truly citizen-centric. This reorientation requires more bottom-up and grassroots-based modes of governance that reformulate smart citizenship into one that pays greater attention to the affective and social contexts behind digital technologies.}
