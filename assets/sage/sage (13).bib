abstract = {As schools and districts across the United States adopt computer science standards and curriculum for K-12 computer science education, they look to integrate the foundational concepts of computational thinking (CT) into existing core subjects of elementary-age students. Research has shown the effectiveness of teaching CT elements (abstraction, generalization, decomposition, algorithmic thinking, debugging) using non-programming, unplugged approaches. These approaches address common barriers teachers face with lack of knowledge, familiarity, or technology tools. Picture books and graphic novels present an unexplored non-programming, unplugged resource for teachers to integrate computational thinking into their CT or CT-integrated lessons. This analysis examines 27 picture books and graphic novels published between 2015 and 2020 targeted to K-6 students for representation of computational thinking elements. Using the computational thinking curriculum framework for K-6, we identify the grade-level competencies of the CT elements featured in the books compared to the books’ target age groups. We compare grade-level competencies to interest level to identify each CT element representation as “foundational,” “on-target,” or “advanced.” We conclude that literature offers teachers a non-programming unplugged resource to expose students to CT and enhance CT and CT-integrated lessons, while also personalizing learning based on CT readiness and interest level.}

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) has emerged as an important method in the United States for helping children learn to solve complex problems and develop skills necessary for coding and other computer science-related endeavors. Research has revealed that CT can be encouraged with children as young as 3–4 years of age. While some preschools and schools are incorporating CT into their curriculum for young children, ages 0–8 years, it is important to understand how environments outside of schools are using CT with young children, particularly given that, in the United States, a large percent of young children, ages 0–5 years, are not in formal school settings. This study provides insight into this area through 20 interviews with educators in libraries and museums to understand how they incorporate CT into their work with young children, ages 0–8 years, and their families. The interviews reveal that library and museum educators are using a variety of developmentally-appropriate approaches, such as play, experimentation, and narrative, to design and offer a diverse array of engaging, hands-on CT activities that allow young children to practice CT in child-centered, meaningful ways.}

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) has gained considerable attention and in-depth discussion over the last two decades. Although the significance of CT has been highlighted, it could be challenging for educators to teach CT. Fortunately, adopting robots in education has been evidenced to be of benefit to promoting students’ learning motivation, CT, and higher-order thinking skills. However, several significant factors affecting students’ programming performances in robot-assisted learning activities have been identified, such as cognitive needs and organization. In this study, a CMR-BBP (concept map robot block-based programming) approach was designed by integrating concept maps into robot block-based programming to enhance students’ programming learning. Moreover, a three-group experiment was carried out in an elementary school to evaluate their learning outcomes. The experimental results revealed that the CMR-BBP approach benefited the students’ perceptions of their computational thinking and problem solving in comparison with the R-BBP (robot block-based programming) and C-BBP (conventional block-based programming) approaches. Furthermore, regarding cognitive load, both the CMR-BBP and R-BBP approaches enhanced the students’ germane cognitive load, while the CMR-BBP approach effectively reduced their extrinsic cognitive load. This study could be a notable reference for designing other courses in conjunction with programming learning activities.}

There has been an increasing interest in integrating computational thinking into STEM and many studies have been conducted to examine the effects of this intervention. This meta-analysis examined the effects of computational thinking integration in STEM on students’ STEM learning performance in the K-12 education context. Following systematic procedures, we identified 20 publications with 21 studies meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria from a range of academic databases. We extracted effect sizes on student learning outcomes in one-group pretest-posttest designs. We also examined a range of moderating variables in the models, including student levels, STEM disciplines, intervention durations, alignment with content standards (e.g., CSTA/NGSS), types of intervention (e.g., simulation), and the use of unplugged/plugged activities. Overall, we found a statistically significant large effect size (g = 0. 85 [95% CI of 0.57–1.14]; p < .001), indicating a large overall effect of computational thinking integration on STEM learning outcomes. The effect sizes were significantly moderated by intervention durations. We provide a discussion of the findings and present implications for future research and practice.}

abstract = {Although abstraction is widely understood to be one of the primary components of computational thinking, the roots of abstraction may be traced back to different fields. Hence, the meaning of abstraction in the context of computational thinking is often confounded, as researchers interpret abstraction through diverse lenses. To disentangle these conceptual threads and gain insight into the operationalisation of abstraction, a systematic review of 96 empirical studies was undertaken. Analysis revealed that identifying features of entities, extracting relevant features, discovering patterns, creating rules and assembling the parts together were the core actions of abstraction. With the primary aim of simplifying practical procedures, abstraction was operationalised as the sophistication of a program, the matching of patterns, the creation of alternative representations, the transfer of solutions, the measurement of a learner’s activity and reading program codes. There is an obvious need for researchers to align the conceptual meanings they have established of abstraction with the practical facts of operationalisation. The need to empirically validate emerging models and the implications for future research are discussed.}

abstract = {We presented a design-based study within the context of a four-session Scratch programming activity among 23 fourth-grade students in Hong Kong. Inspired by the computational thinking (CT) strategies and the 5E instructional model, we investigated students’ mathematical learning of fractions in a Scratch (block-based programming) environment. Students developed CT concepts, practices, and perspectives by building a “fraction magic calculator” in groups. This study analyzed the lesson design, students’ drawings, interviews, and work expressing their mathematical understanding of fractions in Scratch applications. The learning tasks were designed to support the students’ fraction learning and utilized computational abstractions in the form of variables, functions, and iterations to formulate mathematical models in a programming context. Students’ artifacts and feedback showed they were interested in learning fractions in a programming learning context, contributing to exercising and improving their fraction concepts and CT. Ultimately, we emphasized the benefits of CT integrated into mathematics education, promoting students’ understanding of fraction concepts, a set of CT abilities (concepts, practices, perspectives), and learning motivation. Moreover, we suggested a set of non-cognitive skills (e.g., socializing, expressing) to enrich the CT perspectives in the framework and show the importance of developing coding communities to co-create digital artifacts among learners. Overall, we highlighted that mathematics teachers should apply and create learning tasks that promote computational thinking to forge mathematical ideas and thinking.}

abstract = {In this article, Fishbone-based advanced computational thinking (FACT) pedagogy is proposed by fusing fishbone pedagogy and computational thinking pedagogy for enhancing teaching-learning process while teaching engineering and science courses, for engineering and science students respectively. The proposed FACT pedagogy has been implemented using the concept of X-ray machine in biomedical instrumentation course and biomolecules, in biochemistry course. Using fishbone approach, various components of X-ray machine in biomedical course and the components of biomolecules in biochemistry course are visually explained as ribs and riblets of a fishbone diagram, without coining the keywords X-ray and biomolecules in an engineering institution and science institution respectively. Finally, the targeted concept is arrived and explained. Similarly, the same concepts of X-ray and biomolecules are coined among students and they are asked to divide or decompose the concepts into sub-concepts separately. To implement and evaluate the proposed pedagogy, an engineering institution and a science institution have been selected and evaluation results have been published in this article. In this pedagogical approach, the same complex concept is taught as a backward thinking by the teacher using fishbone pedagogy and forward thinking by the students using computational thinking pedagogy. This combined approach helps students to understand any complex concept in science courses. Also, it helps the teachers to easily convey and embed the same among the student community while teaching science courses.}

A total of 110 non-majors in their sophomore year were assigned to either a Logo or a PPS course with attendance being 2 hours per week for 15 weeks. To measure the effectiveness of PPS, the Group Assessment of Logical Thinking and a self-assessment survey pre- and post-test were used. Findings indicated that PPS not only improved students’ overall logical thinking as much as did Logo programming learning, but also increased scores on one more subscale of logical thinking than did the Logo course. In addition, PPS significantly helped students understand the concept of computational thinking and increased their interest in learning computer science.}

The team designed a set of items and explored a subset of those through two qualitative pilots. Then, in order to provide validity evidence based on the test content, a team of 11 subject-matter experts coded the initial pool of items using two different systems of categories based on CT components and contents. Next, the items were piloted on a sample of 289 participants, 137 experts in CT, and 152 novices. After a series of confirmatory factor analyses, a unidimensional model that represents algorithmic thinking was adopted. Further analyzing the psychometric quality of the 27 items, 20 of them with excellent reliability indices were selected for the test. Thus, this study provides a tool to evaluate adults’ CT: the Algorithmic Thinking Test for Adults (ATTA), which was developed according to psychometric standards.

To address this issue, the current article describes a novel approach towards understanding the ontological aspects of CT by using text mining and graph-theoretic techniques to elucidate teachers’ perspectives collected in an online survey (N = 105). In particular, a hierarchical cluster analysis, a knowledge representation method, was applied to identify sub-groups in CT conceptualization and assessment amongst teachers. Five clusters in conceptualization and two clusters in assessment were identified; several relevant and distinct themes were also extracted. The results suggested that teachers attributed CT as a competence domain, relevant in the problem- solving context, as well as applicable and transferrable to various disciplines. The results also shed light on the importance of using multiple approaches to assess the diversity of CT. Overall, the findings collectively contributed to a comprehensive and multi-perspective representation of CT that refine both theory and practice. The methodology employed in this article has suggested a minor but significant step towards addressing the quintessential questions of “what is CT?” and “how is it evidenced?”.}

The sample of this study consisted of 631 in-service teachers from different Chinese primary schools (EFA N = 189; CFA N = 442). The 31-item scale mirrors five factors: cognitive knowledge of CT, practices and skills of CT, attitudes and perspectives of CT, CT teaching design, and CT teaching implementation.

Data sources included pre–post content assessments of computational concepts related to programming in addition to computational artifacts and interviews with a purposeful sample of 12 participants. Quantitative data were analyzed using statistical methods to identify gains in pre- and post-learning of computational thinking concepts and examine potential gender differences. Interview data were analyzed qualitatively. Results indicated that students made significant gains in their learning of computational thinking concepts and that gains persisted over time. Results also revealed differences in learning of computational thinking concepts among boys and girls both at the beginning and end of the program. Finally, results from student interviews provided insights into the development of computational thinking practices and perspectives over time. Results have implications for the design of after-school computing programs that help broaden participation in computing.}

This study compares the impact of Scratch and LEGO® WeDo robotic kits on students’ CT and programming skills development. A quasi-experimental approach was conducted, involving two hundred forty-six participants (n = 246), who were equally divided between Scratch and LEGO® WeDo groups. Results indicate that the LEGO® WeDo group showed greater improvement in CT and programming skills development, while designing and presenting IoT projects. Nevertheless, no significant association between motivation, grit, and CT skills was observed. The findings highlight the potential of tangible robotics in facilitating students’ hands-on learning and enhancing motivation to foster CT and programming skills.

Despite the multifaceted nature of CT, the introduction of CT and associate concepts such as coding is regarded as developmental acceptable for preschool and kindergarten children. For a decade, there has been a focus on educational reform in the form of educational apps. For young children, an influx of mobile apps offering various interfaces and styles promote themselves as having educational value to introduce children aged 5–7 to essential CT, coding, and problem-solving skills. On the contrary, little is known about the educational value of these apps. The fast pace at which developers produce these apps and the breadth of the available apps have gone beyond what it is reasonable for researchers and experts in the domain to evaluate. This article presents a literature review on how the ScratchJr app affects young children’s CT, coding, and general literacy skills. The literature review includes 18 studies. The main conclusion is that although ScratchJr is not a panacea, it seems to be a helpful app that positively affects children’s CT and coding skills.}

Following PRISMA procedures, we identified 17 empirical studies with 34 effect sizes and 1665 participants meeting the inclusion criteria from Web of Science database. Overall, we found a statistically significant large effect size (d = .83 [95% CI: 730, .890]; p < .001) on the CT development of 3–8 years old children, which provides empirical support for having young children to engage in CT experiences. The effect size was significantly influenced by moderating variables including gender, scaffolding, and education level. Intervention length showed a marginally significant effect. Therefore, educators could refer to the significant moderators when designing tailored interventions for CT development in early childhood education while a call for more empirical studies of CT development in young children is proposed.}

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is considered a fundamental skill that everyone in the 21st century should have. Game-based learning (GBL) may be used to teach CT, and it’s necessary to clarify how to design and implement game-based CT teaching. The literature was systematically searched for empirical studies published between 2011 and 2021. Thirty-nine studies were included in the review and findings suggested that GBL has positive effects on CT, but has non-significant effects on some CT elements (e.g., conditions, triggers, and abstraction) because of limited time to learn these elements and students’ preferences for using CT elements. Game elements, particularly clear goals and rules, progressive challenges, immediate feedback, storyline, avatar, social interaction and various reward mechanisms were used to motivate students to engage in activities to develop CT. Furthermore, single or multiple theoretical foundations, such as constructivist learning theory and experiential learning theory, may guide the design and implementation of game-based activities. Problem-solving, project-based approaches were used to encourage students to use CT to solve problems or complete a project. Finally, guidelines for designing and implementing game-based learning activities for promoting CT were discussed.}

abstract = {Computer science and computational thinking (CT) education in K-12 schools have been escalating in recent years. A couple of CT instructional models have been proposed to depict the roles of CT in K-16 education. Yet, neither of them discussed CT infusion into a subject course. In this article, we proposed a CT-integration model called TPC2T. In this model, we suggested considering CT as a second subject and using an appropriate technological pedagogical approach to make students’ learning of two subjects meaningful and engaging. We implemented this model in a CT-integrated lesson in two sections of a high-school Spanish course. Students worked in small groups and coded three small and one comprehensive digital Spanish-culture stories in Scratch. Results showed that students taking the CT-integrated lesson had the same degree of improvement in their Spanish culture knowledge as their peers who did not take the CT-integrated lesson. Besides, students taking the CT-integrated lesson had a significant improvement in their CT knowledge. At the same time, their CT self-efficacy outperformed those who did not take the CT-integrated lesson. We discussed the results and offered suggestions for researchers and educators at the end of the article.}

abstract = {Purpose To analyze mathematics problem-solving (PS) procedures in Chinese (CH) and Canadian (CA) elementary mathematics textbooks that leverage computational thinking (CT) as a cognitive tool, which have evidently existed and been implemented. Design/Approach/Methods In this study, an analysis framework was developed to investigate the characteristics of CT tools for three PS steps—understand the problem, devise and conduct plans, and look back into textbooks—in four contexts: data practices, modeling and simulation practices, computational tools practices, and systemic thinking practices. Findings Our results demonstrate the tools (CT) employed in the PS process in CH and CA mathematics textbooks. The strong connections between the “look back” stage and CT tools were explored. During the “look back” stage, both countries required students to transfer their knowledge and perform generalization. In addition, CT is regarded as a basic skill analysis for students in mathematics education and has received significant attention at every stage of the PS process. Originality/Value This study brings a new perspective to CT research in education by regarding CT as a cognitive tool for students in mathematics PS.}

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT), an essential competency for comprehending and addressing intricate issues in the digital world, has been incorporated into curriculum planning as a goal for programming education. This study introduced flow design into programming curricula to investigate its impact on undergraduates ’CT skills during pair work. Two types of flow design approaches, construct-by-self flow design (CBS-FD) and construct-on-scaffold flow design (COS-FD), were proposed to determine which approach better enhances students’ CT skills. Seventy-six first-year undergraduates participated, including thirty in the CBS group and thirty-six in the COS group. Evaluations made from the results and processes of programming tasks were employed to describe computational performance and computational practices, respectively. Data gathered from CT skill surveys were thoroughly analyzed to gain a deeper understanding of computational perspectives. Our findings highlighted that COS-FD significantly improved participants’ computational performance compared with CBS-FD. The COS groups fostered an engaging, sharing atmosphere, while CBS groups spent more energy on negotiating the manipulation of flow design. Moreover, both COS-FD and CBS-FD proved beneficial in enhancing participants’ computational perspectives, with the COS groups better improving their algorithm thinking. The study presents valuable perspectives on the design and implementation of collaborative programming activities within curriculum education.}
