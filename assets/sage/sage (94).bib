abstract = {Edith Ackermann was one of the most important scholars in the interdisciplinary field of Child-Computer Interaction. Trained as a developmental psychologist and having worked with Jean Piaget in Switzerland, Ackermann went to MIT in 1985 to join an intrepid group of researchers led by Seymour Papert who were trying to understand how extant theories of development and learning would fare in a world in which children would be surrounded by computational artefacts. For the ensuing three decades, Ackermann would use her unique interdisciplinary expertise in the service of creating new theories of development for this new world, generating cutting-edge research, inspiring a generation of students, and producing seminal papers. This article, making use of literature as well as interviews with colleagues of Edith, discusses Ackermann’s contribution to the field, her life trajectory, impact, and ideas. Edith passed away on 24 December 2016.}

abstract = {The emergence of block-based environments aims to facilitate the problems caused by the abstractness of text-based languages. Recent studies generally focus on the effect of having block-based experience on programming education. This study is an attempt to observe the transfer of previous programming experiences (block-based vs. text-based) into a three-dimensional game-making environment through the use of backwards fading. In addition to observation of transfer, students’ perceptions about the difficulty of practices were also investigated. Twenty-one senior university students participated in the study. They practiced through worked example, completion example, and full practice. Moreover, the comparison of the contribution of three examples, their perceived difficulty, and cognitive load has also been observed. There are four main findings that add value to the current literature. First, students having text-based programming experience had higher scores, which may be a sign of far transfer; second, completion example format was more efficient for students having block-based programming experience; third, full practice format was perceived as more difficult than either worked example or completion example; and fourth, based on the efficiency of example formats, completion example represented high efficiency for all students. However, average efficiency of all example formats has represented high efficiency for students, who had text-based programming experience.}

abstract = {Purpose: Rotary blood pumps are a promising treatment approach for patients with a total cavopulmonary connection and a failing cardiovascular system. The aim of this study was to investigate the hemodynamic effects of cavopulmonary support using a numerical model with closed-loop baroreflex and exercise mechanisms. Methods: A numerical model of the univentricular cardiovascular system was developed, mimicking the hemodynamics during rest and exercise. Rotary blood pumps with different hydraulic pump characteristics (flat vs steep pressure-flow relationships) were investigated in the cavopulmonary position. Furthermore, two support modes—a constant speed setting and a physiologically controlled speed—were examined. Results: Hemodynamics without rotary blood pumps were achieved with less than 10% deviation from reported values during rest and exercise. Rotary blood pumps at constant speed improve the hemodynamics at rest, however, they constitute a hydraulic resistance during light (steep characteristics) or moderate (flat characteristics) exercise. In contrast, physiologic control increases cardiac output (moderate exercise: 8.2 vs 7.4 L/min) and reduces sympathetic activation (heart rate at moderate exercise: 111 vs 123 bpm). Conclusion: In this simulation study, the necessity of an automatically controlled rotary blood pump in the cavopulmonary position was shown. A pump at constant speed might constitute an additional resistance to venous return during physical activity. Therefore, a physiologic control algorithm based on the pressure difference between the caval veins and the atrial pressure is proposed to improve hemodynamics, especially during physical activity.}

This article dissects a campaign to actively shape that environment led by professional fact-checking organizations. We trace the development of the Share the Facts “widget,” a device designed to give fact-checks greater purchase in algorithmically governed media networks by driving adoption of a new data standard called ClaimReview. We show how “structured journalism” gave journalists a language for the social and technical challenges involved, and how this infrastructural technology mediates between fact-checkers, audiences, and platform companies. We argue that this standard-setting initiative exhibits both promotional and disciplining facets, offering greater distribution and impact to journalists while also defining their work in specific ways. Crucially, in this case, this disciplining influence reflects internal professional-institutional agendas in an emerging subfield of journalism as much as the demands of platform companies.}

The purpose of AVIZE is to aid users in the construction and self-evaluation of real-world arguments in the domain of international politics. AVIZE provides a set of argument schemes as cognitive building blocks for constructing argument diagrams. Most of the schemes are related to concepts from the field of automated plan recognition in artificial intelligence. While some currently available argument diagramming tools provide schemes, they are not tailored to the domain of international politics. This paper describes the argument schemes for this domain and the design of the argument diagramming tool.}

abstract = {Application of direct injection (DI) technology in small-bore engines, the type used in two- and three-wheelers, could improve their performance significantly. It is recognised that the use of high fuel injection pressure is beneficial in large-bore engines for a good mixture preparation. However, simple systems incorporated with low-pressure DI are desirable in small-engine segment of automobiles. Further, high fuel pressures will result in excessive wall wetting when cylinder dimensions are small. Extensive studies were carried out to investigate the minimum fuel injection pressure required for homogeneous and lean modes of operation in such small bore DI engine. The effect of spark plug protrusion in the combustion chamber was also investigated under the spray-guided configuration. Comprehensive experiments and CFD simulations were performed for estimating the engine efficiency, emissions, mixture preparation characteristics, fuel spray and fuel impingement on combustion chamber walls. Results have demonstrated that engine performance and emissions did not deteriorate when fuel injection pressure was reduced from 150 to 50 bar at full load. However, at very low pressures, like 20–30 bar, THC, CO and smoke emissions increased. Fuel injection pressure did not influence the lean limit, that is, equivalence ratio of about 0.77, but influenced the thermal efficiency at lean conditions. In order to attain high efficiency, under lean conditions, a minimum fuel pressure of 80 bar was required. The spark plug protrusion that resulted in a gap of 0.75 mm with respect to the incoming fuel spray cone has given the best engine performance, while higher protrusions affected the tumble flow and led to the stratification of charge near the spark plug, which resulted in elevated CO and smoke emissions. Hence, this work highlights that relatively lower direct injection pressures are suitable in small bore engines, which will impact the development of cost effective components for such applications.}

Thus, the evaluation of research productivity has become relevant due to the emerging development of the PAH continuum as a theoretical framework. This paper aims to explore the research productivity within the PAH continuum by performing a bibliometric performance analysis. An iterative search strategy was performed to identify PAH authors and then investigate their research productivity over a 5-year period (2017–2022) using the SciVal analytics instrument by Elsevier. Drawing upon the results from multiple bibliometric analyses, the study explores publication productivity specifically in relation to the PAH continuum. This study revealed that distance education, learning, teaching, professional development, and lifelong learning have been the most prominent research areas within the PAH continuum. Within that, related topics were identified, including online learning, mobile learning, e-learning, and educational technology.}

abstract = {The fundamental nature of learning is a central problem in psychology. Traditionally, psychologists have assumed that learning must involve the formation of associations. Early last century, the pioneering work of Pavlov on conditioned learning in animals seemed to put this assumption beyond doubt. More recently, many psychologists came to believe that a different kind of process must underlie complex learning, such as language learning in humans, and that this process must be described as computational rather than associative. Whether complex human learning is associative or computational continues to be a subject of intense research. The articles in this Special Section turn this debate on its head by asking whether simple animal learning is associative or computational. Surprisingly, the question is still very much open, and excitingly, it appears quite tractable.}

However, relatively little attention has been paid to digital capitalism’s cultural underpinnings and the beliefs of those who develop most digital technologies. In this paper, we argue that a solutionist order of worth – in which value derives from solving social problems through technology – has become central to an emerging spirit of digital capitalism. We use supervised learning to trace the relative importance of different orders of worth in three novel text corpora. We find that solutionism is indeed central to the normative beliefs of digital elites and the broader digital milieu, but not to capitalist discourse at large. We illustrate the importance of these findings by discussing how the spirit of digital capitalism motivates, legitimates, and orients the actions of digital capitalists.}

In it subjects use a PC-based interactive map to choose routes link by link in various scenarios. The scenarios include two types of maps: the first map presents a choice between one stochastic route and one deterministic route, and the second contains real-time information and an available detour. The first type of map measures the basic risk attitude of the subject. The second type allows for strategic planning and measures the effect of this opportunity on subjects’ choice behavior. Results from each subject are analyzed to determine whether the subject planned strategically for the en route information or simply selected fixed paths from origin to destination. The full data set is used to estimate several choice models with expected travel times and standard deviations as explanatory variables. Estimation results are used to assess whether models that incorporate strategic behavior more accurately reflect route choice than do simpler path-based models.}

This article presents a life-cycle management framework for online monitoring and performance assessment of wind turbines, enabling optimum maintenance and inspection planning at minimum associated life-cycle costs. Incorporating continuously updated monitoring data (i.e. structural, environmental, and operational data), the framework allows capturing and understanding the actual wind turbine condition and, hence, reduces uncertainty in structural responses as well as load effects acting on the structure. As will be shown in this article, the framework integrates a variety of heterogeneous hardware and software components, including sensors and data acquisition units, server systems, Internet-enabled user interfaces as well as finite element models for system identification, and a multiagent system for self-detecting sensor malfunctions. To validate its capabilities and to demonstrate its practicability, the framework is deployed for continuous monitoring and life-cycle management of a 500-kW wind turbine. Remote life-cycle analyses of the monitored wind turbine are conducted, and case studies are presented investigating both the structural performance and the operational efficiency of the wind turbine.}

Through this analysis, this article aims at understanding some of the tensions between legacy and digital culture that many newsrooms today are marked by and how these tensions affect professional knowledge creations for the journalists of tomorrow. The study is framed by sociomaterial perspectives on learning and journalistic practice and argues that two types of materiality are especially important for j-students’ professional knowledge creation during periods of internship: the structure and layout of the newsroom and the software applications in use at the newsroom.}

The problems of legibility require evaluating the advantages of stroke-generation techniques over the raster-scan technology in producing straight, clearly defined vectors. Also, the system requires a highly reliable, modularly expandable, high-throughput system which would apply to both the SCC and NCS man/machine interface requirements. To effectively maintain the display console hardware, it should be identical for both the SCC and NCS segments; however, the segments must be addressable for different functional operations and displayed information. Thus the operational parameters were assigned to software programs. Functions of the SCC include space catalog maintenance, space sensor system status, space weapons support, system control and support, programming support, and personnel subsystem support. To perform these functions within the allowable time constraints, a highly automated and highly interactive computer system is needed. The Human Factors role in console definition, man/computer interface considerations, and facility layout problems will be discussed in the paper.}
