abstract = {Within the context of the growing polarisation and fragmentation of the urban landscape, this paper presents a computational typology applicable to the study of minority communities, both ethnic and religious, which is useful in understanding their spatial distribution and juxtaposition at neighbourhood levels. The typology has been applied to multicultural London with the use of the 2001 Census, in which there were questions on ethnicity and religion. The landscape of religion is found to be more highly segregated in contrast to the landscape of ethnicity. Furthermore, on the basis of a preliminary analysis of indicator variables, minorities seem on aggregate to be in an improved situation given a level of residential segregation, with the exception of residents of segregated Asian-Bangladeshi areas for ethnicity and residents of segregated Muslim areas for religion. This questions the generally held view that segregation in a multicultural society is undesirable per se and suggests that a ‘one size fits all’ government policy towards residential segregation is insufficiently perceptive. The typology introduced here should facilitate a more critically informed approach to multiculturalism and the contemporary city.}

abstract = {There is increasing interest in the use of mechanism-based multi-scale computational models (such as agent-based models (ABMs)) to generate simulated clinical populations in order to discover and evaluate potential diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. The description of the environment in which a biomedical simulation operates (model context) and parameterization of internal model rules (model content) requires the optimization of a large number of free parameters. In this work, we utilize a nested active learning (AL) workflow to efficiently parameterize and contextualize an ABM of systemic inflammation used to examine sepsis. Contextual parameter space was examined using four parameters external to the model’s rule set. The model’s internal parameterization, which represents gene expression and associated cellular behaviors, was explored through the augmentation or inhibition of signaling pathways for 12 signaling mediators associated with inflammation and wound healing. We have implemented a nested AL approach in which the clinically relevant (CR) model environment space for a given internal model parameterization is mapped using a small Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The outer AL level workflow is a larger ANN that uses AL to efficiently regress the volume and centroid location of the CR space given by a single internal parameterization. We have reduced the number of simulations required to efficiently map the CR parameter space of this model by approximately 99%. In addition, we have shown that more complex models with a larger number of variables may expect further improvements in efficiency.}

In chemico assays are available that attempt to identify reactive compounds. These approaches have been developed independently for pharmaceuticals and for other non-pharmaceutical compounds.

For both sets of methods, there are great opportunities to capture in chemico information by using in silico methods to provide computational tools for screening purposes. In order to use these in chemico and in silico methods, integrated testing strategies are required for individual toxicity endpoints.

Twelve researchers of varying experience levels attempted to reproduce the results of the empirical articles in the target issue (at least three researchers per article).

abstract = {Numerical analysis is increasingly used for batch modelling runs, with each individual model possessing a unique combination of input parameters sampled from a range of potential values. Whilst such an approach can help to develop a comprehensive understanding of the inherent unpredictability and variability of explosive events, or populate training/validation data sets for machine learning approaches, the associated computational expense is relatively high. Furthermore, any given model may share a number of common solution steps with other models in the batch, and simulating all models from birth to termination may result in large amounts of repetition. This paper presents a new branching algorithm that ensures calculation steps are only computed once by identifying when the parameter fields of each model in the batch becomes unique. This enables informed data mapping to take place, leading to a reduction in the required computation time. The branching algorithm is explained using a conceptual walk-through for a batch of 9 models, featuring a blast load acting on a structural panel in 2D. By eliminating repeat steps, approximately 50% of the run time can be saved. This is followed by the development and use of the algorithm in 3D for a practical application involving 20 complex containment structure models. In this instance, a ∼20% reduction in computational costs is achieved.}

abstract = {For a better insight in dialyzer efficiency with respect to local mass transport in a low flux dialyzer (Fresenius F6HPS), blood and dialysate flow distributions were visualized with computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations, which were validated with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. To visualize blood-side flow while avoiding transport through the fiber membrane, a bolus of 99m-Technetium labeled MAA (Macro Aggregated Albumin) was injected in the flow using an electronic valve. Water was used to simulate blood, but flow rate was adjusted according to laws of dynamic similarity to account for the viscosity difference (factor 2.75). For the visualization of dialysate flow, a bolus of 99m-Technetium labeled DMSA (Dimercaptosuccinic Acid) was injected, while pressurized air in the blood compartment avoided transmembrane flow. For each test series, 3D acquisitions were made on a two respectively three-headed SPECT camera. By evaluating the images at different time steps, dynamic 3D intensity plots were obtained, which were further used to derive local flow velocities. Additionally, three-dimensional CFD models were developed for simulating the overall blood and dialysate flow, respectively. In both models, the whole fiber compartment was defined as a porous medium with overall axial and radial permeability derived theoretically and from in vitro tests. With the imaging as well as with the computational technique, a homogeneous blood flow distribution was found, while vortices and fluid stagnation were observed in the dialyzer inlet manifold. The non-homogeneous dialysate distribution, as found with SPECT imaging, implies the occurrence of non-efficient sites with respect to mass transfer. The discrepancy between the dialysate results of both techniques indicated that the assumption of a constant fiber bundle permeability in the CFD model was too optimistic. In conclusion, medical imaging techniques like SPECT are very helpful to validate CFD models, which can be further applied for dialyzer design and optimization.}

abstract = {This paper is the second in a series implementing initial strain–energy-based thermo-elastoviscoplastic isotropic damage–self-healing formulations for bituminous composites to compare the model predictions with experimental measurements. Computational algorithms based on the two-step operator splitting methodology are systematically developed and employed for numerical simulations. The elastic damage self-healing predictor and the viscoplastic corrector coupled with the Arrhenius-type temperature term via the net stress concept in conjunction with the hypothesis of strain equivalence are entirely considered as numerical implementation of the models. Several numerical examples of one-dimensional driver problems are first presented to show the effect of temperature and rest period for healing. Experimental validation of the proposed formulations against monotonic constant–strain test under different temperatures and controlled-strain cyclic tension test is presented. Qualitative and quantitative agreement between experimental results and numerical simulations is also observed. In particular, the softening behavior of the bituminous materials is well predicted for monotonic constant–strain rate test. The viscous damage behavior can be reasonably captured by the proposed damage models with the Arrhenius-type temperature term and the step-by-step computational algorithms.}

abstract = {This paper aims to investigate how the trade-offs involved in the construction and solution of restrictive master problems for the user equilibrium traffic assignment problem may affect the overall convergence performance of the solution algorithms. Three strategies used to update user equilibrium path sets in path-based algorithms are examined: an origin–destination (O-D)-based strategy that updates the path set for each single O-D pair just before path flows are updated, an origin-based strategy that updates path sets for all O-D pairs associated with the same origin at once, and a simultaneous strategy that updates the path sets for all O-D pairs together. Three recently developed path-based algorithms to update the path sets by using three strategies are implemented for solution of the restrictive master problems. The implementation strategies are tested on medium to large real networks, and their relative performance characteristics are compared. The results show that the construction and update of the restrictive master problems by the different strategies have significant impacts on convergence as well as solution noise. The computational time for convergence under the simultaneous and origin-based strategies is significantly less than that under the O-D-based strategy. In addition, the solution obtained by adoption of the simultaneous strategy exhibits less noise than the other two strategies. These results provide important theoretical and practical insights into solution algorithms for the traffic assignment problem.}

Movement of ships and submarines on the free surface of calm water creates the surface wave. Because of the difference in the bow shape and freeboard height, the wave making system in ships and submarines is different. Rounded or elliptical bow shape of submarines generates a high bow wave which causes deck and bow wetness. This is because of the fact that in submarines, this situation arises a small freeboard. In submarines, Deck wetness (because of deck flooding) is a very important subject that has some remarkable consequences, such as increase in resistance and added weigh. The focus of this article is on the added frictional resistance in the deck wetness condition. The bow wave profile, deck wetness and added resistance are studied in several Froude numbers by computational fluid dynamics method. This analysis is performed for a bare hull model at two different drafts by Flow Vision (V.2.3) software based on computational fluid dynamics method and solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations.}

Recently, carbon films have been attracting much interest as surface-coating materials due to its excellent properties such as low friction and good wear resistance. In this study, the low-friction mechanisms of carbon films were analyzed using molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations. Molecular dynamics simulation results showed that the termination of OH groups on the surface of the diamond substantially reduced the friction coefficient from 0.07 to 0.01. This reduction was achieved because termination of OH groups weakened the covalent interaction between Fe and C atoms, which was indicated by density functional theory calculations. Additionally, based on the concept of terminating the OH groups on the surface of diamond-like carbon films, we carried out the reciprocating friction experiment between hydrogen-free diamond-like carbon surface and glycerin, which contains large number of OH groups. The friction coefficient of the glycerin was 0.028, much lower than that of the base oil, which was 0.075. The experiments confirmed that OH groups on the surface of hydrogen-free diamond-like carbon films greatly improved the friction properties of its films.}

Not surprisingly, kinship terminologies are particularly amenable to formal representation. Researchers throughout the history of kinship studies have noted the logicality of kinship terminology systems. The logic is explored here through the kin term computations made by users of a terminology when computing the kinship relation one person has to another by referring to a third person for whom each has a kin term relationship.

abstract = {Calcium silicate hydrate Jennite is a molecular structure commonly accepted as a representation of the complex calcium silicate hydrate gel formed during the hydration of typical Portland cement. In this paper, the behavior of nanoscale calcium silicate hydrate Jennite under shear deformation was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. Computational samples representing the nanoscale structure of calcium silicate hydrate Jennite were subjected to shear deformation in order to investigate not only their mechanical properties but also their deformation behavior. The simulation results indicated that the nanoscale calcium silicate hydrate Jennite under shear deformation displays a linear elastic behavior up to shear stress of approximately 1.0 GPa, and shear deformation of about 0.08 radians, after which point yielding and plastic deformation occurs. The shear modulus determined from the simulations was 11.2 ± 0.7 GPa. The deformation-induced displacements in molecular structures were analyzed dividing the system in regions representing calcium oxide layers. The displacement/deformation of the layers of calcium oxide forming the structure of nanoscale calcium silicate hydrate Jennite was analyzed. The non-linear stress–strain behavior in the molecular structure was attributed to a non-linear increase in the displacement due to sliding of the calcium oxide layers on top of each other with higher shearing. These results support the idea that by controlling the chemical reactions, the tailored morphologies can be used to increase the interlinking between the calcium oxide layers, thus minimizing the shearing of the layers and leading to molecular structures that can withstand larger deformation and have improved failure behavior.}

abstract = {This research quantitatively investigates the impact of violence on the propagation of images in social media in the context of political protest. Using a computational approach, we measure the relative violence of a large set of images shared on Twitter during the protests against the G20 summit in Frankfurt am Main in 2017. This allows us to investigate if more violent content is shared more times and faster than less violent content on Twitter, and if different online communities can be characterized by the level of violence of the visual content they share. The results show that the level of violence in an image tweet does not correlate with the number of retweets and mentions it receives that the time to retweet is marginally lower for image tweets containing a high level of violence and that the level of violence in image tweets differs between communities.}

abstract = {Despite the plethora of published studies on intracranial aneurysms (IAs) hemodynamic using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), limited progress has been made towards understanding the complex physics and biology underlying IA pathophysiology. Guided by 1733 published papers, we review and discuss the contemporary IA hemodynamics paradigm established through two decades of IA CFD simulations. We have traced the historical origins of simplified CFD models which impede the progress of comprehending IA pathology. We also delve into the debate concerning the Newtonian fluid assumption used to represent blood flow computationally. We evidently demonstrate that the Newtonian assumption, used in almost 90% of studies, might be insufficient to describe IA hemodynamics. In addition, some fundamental properties of the Navier–Stokes equation are revisited in supplementary material to highlight some widely spread misconceptions regarding wall shear stress (WSS) and its derivatives. Conclusively, our study draws a roadmap for next-generation IA CFD models to help researchers investigate the pathophysiology of IAs.}
