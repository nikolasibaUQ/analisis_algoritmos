abstract = {The three-dimensional (3D) printing of polymer matrix composites has attracted considerable attention. However, the addition of filler materials to the extruded polymer matrix results in inner voids within the beads along with larger voids, called intervoids, which are generated between the beads during the 3D printing process. These voids degrade the thermal transport properties of 3D-printed polyether ether ketone (PEEK) and PEEK/carbon-fiber composites. The effects of these pores (i.e., their number, size, and location) on the thermal conductivity of 3D-printed PEEK and a PEEK/carbon-fiber composite were investigated using a multiscale finite element approach. The presence of the carbon fibers mitigated the effect of the pores on the thermal conductivity of the PEEK/carbon-fiber composite, particularly along the longitudinal direction. Moreover, the inner voids had a dominant effect on the PEEK and PEEK/carbon-fiber composite. Finally, the orientation of the intervoids had no effect on the thermal conductivity of the printed materials.}

abstract = {In online social networks, spam profiles represent one of the most serious security threats over the Internet; if they do not stop producing bad advertisements, they can be exploited by criminals for various purposes. This article addresses the nature and the characteristics of spam profiles in a social network like Twitter to improve spam detection, based on a number of publicly available language-independent features. In order to investigate the effectiveness of these features in spam detection, four datasets are extracted for four different language contexts (i.e. Arabic, English, Korean and Spanish), and a fifth is formed by combining them all. We conduct our experiments using a set of five well-known classification algorithms in spam detection field, k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT) (J48) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifiers, along with five filter-based feature selection methods, namely, Information Gain, Chi-square, ReliefF, Correlation and Significance. The results show oscillating performance of each classifier across all datasets, but improved classification results with feature selection. In addition, detailed analysis and comparisons are carried out on two different levels: in the first level, we compare the selected features’ importance among the feature selection methods, whereas in the second level, we observe the relations and the importance of the selected features across all datasets. The findings of this article lead to a better understanding of social spam and improving detection methods by considering the various important features resulting from the different lingual contexts.}

abstract = {Cognitive control refers to the processes by which individual cognitive functions are coordinated in the service of higher-level goals. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the middle front of the brain monitors performance, and it is activated when the need for control increases—for instance, in difficult situations or when errors occur. Since the late 1990s, the ACC has been thought to signal when there is conflict between competing action plans so that the conflict can be resolved. More recently, an alternative model has reconceptualized the role of ACC as that of a predictor and evaluator of the likely outcomes of planned actions before the actions are performed. This new Predicted Response Outcome model accounts for a broader range of findings than the earlier framework and suggests that the ACC might support the cognitive operations by which individuals can “think before they act” in order to avoid risky or otherwise poor choices.}

abstract = {Drawing on struggles within academe between faculty that promote critical education and advocates of New Public Management (NPM) who endorse instrumental learning, I reimagine the university as a counter-space that positions it as a counter-power to informational capitalism. Initially, I outline its twin threats: ethical, as self-entrepreneurial academics are valorised by NPM; and political, with informationalisation conflating spaces of thinking. I then detail Scott Lash’s specific account of how the info-comm society negates critique. However, his monistic understanding of informationalisation means Lash’s alternative of Informationskritik risks subsumption by it. I therefore defer to Jacques Derrida’s idea of the university. To ensure the autonomy of the principle of reason in a world of info-comm flows, the university is a supplementary body to society, yet intimately linked to it by its critical reflexivity, which is on behalf of society. Because Derrida does not elaborate the requisite institutional architecture, I conclude with Michel Foucault’s notion of heterotopia as a quasi-illicit site that is different and other. Such an institutional design enables the university as a counter-space that is a bank of reason and an archive of its manifestation in social practices. It also upholds a space for thinking, which in the form of nominalist critical history proffers a counter-power to society as an informational homotopia.}

While much scholarship supports gamification, labor sociologists have long problematized the phenomenon. In this mixed-methods action research study, we explore the results of gamifying a lesson on gamification in a sociology of work course. We designed two gamified activities with varying degrees of consent that followed a lesson on gamification and consent. Students rated how problematic a series of gamified work scenarios were before and after the intervention. Our quantitative data did not show a significant increase in students’ ability to identify consent after the intervention, but we did discover that students took either an employee or employer’s perspective in their rating justifications. Furthermore, these findings were gendered. This article highlights the need for a more critical take on gamification in the classroom. We conclude by suggesting ways practitioners can teach about gamification in other contexts.}

abstract = {We present a framework for making computation offloading decisions in computational grid settings in which schedulers determine when to move parts of a computation to more capable resources to improve performance. Such schedulers must predict when an offloaded computation will outperform one that is local by forecasting the local cost (execution time for computing locally) and remote cost (execution time for computing remotely and transmission time for the input/output of the computation to/from the remote system). Typically, this decision amounts to predicting the bandwidth between the local and remote systems to estimate these costs. Our framework unifies such decision models by formulating the problem as a statistical decision problem that can either be treated “classically” or using a Bayesian approach. Using an implementation of this framework, we evaluate the efficacy of a number of different decision strategies (several of which have been employed by previous systems). Our results indicate that a Bayesian approach employing automatic change-point detection when estimating the prior distribution is the best performing approach.}

abstract = {In this article we consider the problem of task-directed information gathering. We first develop a decision-theo retic model of task-directed sensing in which sensors are modeled as noise-contaminated, uncertain measurement systems, and sensing tasks are inodeled by a transforma tion describing the type of information required by the task, a utility function describing sensitivity to error, and a cost function describing time or resource constraints on the system. This description allows us to develop a standard condi tional Bayes decision-making model where the value of information, or payoff, of an estimate is defined as the average utility (the expected value of some function of decision or estimation error) relative to the current proba bility distribution and the best estimate is that which max imizes payoff. The optimal sensor viewing strategy is that which maximizes the net payoff (decision value minus observation costs) of the final estimate. The advantage of this solution is generality—it does not assume a particular sensing modality or sensing task. However, solutions to this updating problem do not exist in closed form. This motivates the development of an approximation to the optimal solution based on a grid-based implementation of Bayes’ theorem. We describe this algorithm, analyze its error properties. and indicate how it can be made robust to errors in the description of sensors and discrepancies between geomet ric models and sensed objects. We also present the results of this fusion technique applied to several different infor mation gathering tasks in simulated situations and in a distributed sensing system we have constructed.}

We quantify and describe this property via an analytical exposition highlighting the counterintuitive geometry implied by marginal threshold-setting in multiple dimensions. Recommendations are presented that encourage applied researchers to think jointly, rather than marginally, when setting cutoff scores to ensure an informative test.}

But how are we to engage synergistically with other-than-human life forms and systems? While synergy with animals presents no in-principle difficulty, synergy with larger life systems takes us into epistemological realms explored only in the margins of the Western tradition, such as in Goethe’s Romantic alternative to science.

abstract = {Advanced combustion concepts, like homogeneous charge compression ignition, are limited by their narrow operating range, which stems from a lack of control over the heat release process. This study explores a new advanced combustion mode, called thermally stratified compression ignition, which uses a direct water injection event to control the heat release process in low-temperature combustion. A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model coupled with detailed chemical kinetics is used to better understand the effects of direct water injection on thermal stratification in the cylinder and the resulting heat release process. Previous results showed that increasing the injection pressure results in a significantly broader temperature distribution due to increased evaporative cooling. In this way, direct water injection can control low-temperature combustion heat release and extend significantly the operable load range. In this study, simulations were performed over a range of start of injection timings in order to determine its effect on thermal stratification and heat release. The results show that for both low and high injection pressures advancing the start of water injection results in increased thermal stratification and reduced peak pressure and heat release rate for injections occurring after −60 °CAD. Before −60 °CAD, advancing the water injection has a varied effect on thermal stratification and heat release depending on the injection pressure and mass of the injected water.}

abstract = {A detailed micromechanical finite element analysis methodology is presented to predict the transverse tensile (fiber perpendicular) failure behavior of a unidirectional (UD) glass fiber-reinforced plastic composite ply. In order to understand the constituent-level stress–strain and damage behavior, finite element analysis is accomplished using representative volume element (RVE) that consists of random fiber distribution as observed in the microscopic image of an actual composite ply. For modeling the fiber/matrix interface failure behavior, cohesive zone module (cohesive surface/cohesive element) of Abaqus® is used. In order to capture the epoxy matrix stiffness and strength degradation, the following two different approaches are used: (i) initially, the linear Drucker–Prager plasticity model in combination with a ductile fracture criterion is used; (ii) later, a brittle failure approach such as the quadratic normal stress criterion within the framework of eXtended finite element method is used. From the detailed micromechanical analysis of the RVE, it is observed that the initial damage in the RVE occurs in the form of fiber/matrix interface decohesion. With increasing tensile load, interface crack propagates and creates a stress concentration region in the matrix material, adjacent to the crack tip. Further load application causes both interface crack tip and matrix stress concentration to move away from the load application direction. As soon as the interface crack tip reaches approximately 60° to 70° away from the load application direction, the conjunction of the matrix damage with the interface crack leads to the RVE final failure. The predicted average stress–strain curves from the above-mentioned two different epoxy matrix failure criterions (ductile and brittle) correlate very well with the experimental results, indicating that the brittle failure behavior of a UD fiber-reinforced plastic composite ply under transverse tensile load is mainly controlled by the fiber/matrix interface properties.}

Here, the main focus is on the details of the computations and the comparison with experimental results for flow in the plenum. Details of the experiment are described elsewhere. By varying mesh density, boundary conditions, discretization schemes and turbulence models, a wide-ranging study of the accuracy of computational techniques for an industrial problem has been made. In particular, levels of mesh refinement for converged numerical solutions have been determined, together with performance levels for the various settings used. In terms of velocity prediction, when the flow is driven by boundary conditions specified at the outlet more accurate results are achieved. This is due to the flow at the inlet being calculated more accurately in these cases. The effects of different discretization schemes and turbulence models on the velocity predictions are small. Pressure predictions are, however, improved by more complex turbulence models such as the renormalization group (RNG) model.}

abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated digitalisation efforts in many countries as they try to contain the virus. With the physical handling of cash posing as a potential virus transmission risk, digital payments have become important in the urgent transition to a cashless society and a key feature of smart city projects. Critical analyses have typically framed smart cities as neoliberalist developmental projects that see the partnering of the state with private corporations. However, it is unclear how the smart city emerges under the technocratic inclinations of the developmental state. Focusing on the digital payments project under Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative, this paper unpacks the discursive practices employed in mobilising citizen support for electronic payments through a critical analysis of publicly available government materials and recent initiatives. The discourse surrounding digital payments is bound up in narratives surrounding economic competitiveness, technological progress and public health and safety, and strongly rooted in a technocratic governance ethos that limits genuine citizen participation in shaping smart payments technologies. This paper argues that such discursive framings represent a missed opportunity to build a smart city that is truly citizen-centric. This reorientation requires more bottom-up and grassroots-based modes of governance that reformulate smart citizenship into one that pays greater attention to the affective and social contexts behind digital technologies.}

abstract = {In this article, mode I interlaminar fracture toughness (GIC) of Vectran-stitched laminated composite is determined experimentally and computa- tionally. Critical strain energy release rates are measured by performing double can- tilever beam test on composites stitched with Vectran as stitch fiber, and are found to increase with increasing stitch thread thickness and stitch density. It is also revealed that the relationship between GIC and stitch density or stitch thread volume fraction appears to be linear. Interlaminar tension test is conducted to identify important fracture behavior of a single Vectran stitch fiber thread. The finite-element (FE) model of the stitched composite incorporates the novel four-step stitch fracture pro- cess, namely, interfacial debonding, slack absorption, fiber breakage, and pullout friction. The FE predictions of load-displacement curves and critical mode I strain energy release rates show good agreement with the experimental results. The differ- ences in interdependent stitch mechanisms between moderately stitched and densely stitched composites are discussed.}
