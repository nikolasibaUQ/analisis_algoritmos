abstract = {This paper presents the results of comparison of experimental and CFD studies of slug flow in a vertical 90° bend using validated models. For the experimental part, Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT), Wire Mesh Tomography (WMS), and high-speed videos were used to monitor an air-silicone oil mixture flowing in a vertical 90o bend. The ECT probes were mounted before the bend whilst the WMS was positioned either immediately upstream or immediately downstream of the bend. The downstream pipe was maintained horizontal whilst the upstream pipe was maintained vertical. The bend (R/D = 2.3) was made of transparent acrylic resin. Parallel to the experiments, simulations were carried out for same experiment set-up using the commercial software package Star-CD and Star-CCM+. The condition was simulated with the Volume of Fluid (VOF) model. The simulation predictions were validated against the experimental data. A reasonably good agreement was observed for the results of the experiment and CFD.}

abstract = {This study aims to predict the overall aerodynamic performance, unsteady forces and the tonal noise radiation from a small axial flow fan. The computation is divided into two stages: (a) the computation of the unsteady flow field at design and off-design working conditions, and (b) detailed analysis of the acoustic field. A dual-time scheme for dealing with rotor-stator or wake-struts interactions in turbomachinery environments by introducing a pseudo-time to represent the time variation of source terms and the finite volume control method are applied for the unsteady solutions involving the whole flow passages of the axial flow fan, and the pressure rise against volume flow rate is obtained and shown to be in good agreement with experimental data. The interaction of the rotor wake and the downstream struts has been simulated by investigating the effects of source distribution over the whole blades. And the tonal noise is then predicted based on Lowson’s theory. The unsteady force is divided into thrust in the rotational axis direction and drag in the rotational direction for the rotor and struts. It is demonstrated that the unsteady forces acting on the rotor and struts are produced by the interaction between them, and has a close relationship with the rotor wake structure and the strut alignment. In the rotor near wake, both the viscous and potential flow is dominant not only to aerodynamic forces but also to interaction noise. The present study shows that the higher lean angle of struts can gain about 4 dB reduction of overall sound power level compared to the smallest one.}

As a promising educational technology field, Learning Analytics (LA) tools or systems can offer solutions to COVID-19 pandemic-related needs, obstacles, and expectations in higher education. In the current study, we systematically reviewed 20 papers to better understand the responses of LA tools to the online learning challenges that higher education students, instructors, and institutions faced during the pandemic. In addition, we attempted to provide key cases in which LA has been effectively deployed for various purposes during the pandemic in the higher education context. We found out several prominent challenges for stakeholders. Accordingly, learners needed of timely support and interaction, and experienced difficulty of time management. Instructors lacked pedagogical knowledge for online teaching. In particular, individual and collaborative assessment have been a challenge for them. Institutions have not been ready for a digital transformation and online teaching. In response to these challenges, LA tools have been deployed for the following opportunities: monitoring, planning online learning process, fostering learners’ engagement and motivation, facilitating assessment process; increasing interaction, improving retention, being easy to use. Understanding these promises can also give insight into future higher education policies.}

abstract = {Assessing evolution of cognitive structures across historical periods has remained challenging in the absence of direct access to humans from the past. Overcoming some of these challenges, we examined shifts in the implicit cognitive structures in the Epic of Gilgamesh, which is one of the earliest surviving pieces of literature, circulating in various versions over a period of approx. 2000 years in ancient Mesopotamia. Using a canonical English translation, we applied natural language processing (NLP) and human coding to extract low-dimensional representations of the implicit personality structure in three different historical epochs. We found systematic shifts over time with increasing complexity and increasing resemblance of contemporary personality models in later periods. We discuss how lexical analyses of ancient texts using trait co-occurrence analyses can provide novel insights on the evolution of human behaviour of relevance for contemporary social and behavioural science and the study of ancient societies.}

This design study uses a method that we have previously used to analyse the effects of helmet liner material properties. While the helmet liner is of vital importance for energy absorption, other design modifications can also serve to improve its performance. The equestrian helmet model previously developed and analysed by the authors was used in this study. The helmet shell and geometric factors, such as a gap between the liner and shell, ventilation holes and ridges on the helmet liner were studied to observe their influence on helmet performance. By studying helmet design variations in terms of different variables other than headform linear acceleration, it is possible to determine which helmet configurations perform better, why they perform the way they do and how efficiently they perform. This can assist the product design and optimization process by suggesting models which would optimize cost, weight and helmet size.}

This systematic literature review outlines research on primary education during 2000–2022 that relates students’ EF and digital technology through empirical data and suggested SEN-inclusive educational interventions. 288 full-text journal articles were assessed, and 26 were included for analysis. Findings include common game-based solutions for EF and SEN support, enabling explicit goals, short teaching activities, and recorded outcomes. Other examples include EF skills training and classroom management with digital monitoring devices. A substantially increased research interest during 2021–2022 was observed. Aspects needing further research are discussed, such as more special education views with cost-effective behavioral approaches.}

The performance of a micromechanical model, where the heterogeneous microstructure of the MMC is explicitly modelled, in predicting the tensile stress—strain behaviour of an AA2009 + 25% SiCp MMC is examined. A macroscale modelling approach is used to simulate extrusion of the MMC through two different die designs, where the MMC is modelled as a homogeneous continuum. Firstly, the extrusion results are used to compare the two die designs, to determine which is the more favourable. Secondly, the predicted macroscale plastic strain distributions and pressures are used with the micromechanical model to assess microscale stress states in the material during extrusion with a view to gaining insights into the risk of damage in the material. In this context, pressure is shown to be hugely important in controlling tensile stress magnitude and in reducing microscale damage risk, and essentially ensuring that extrusion can be achieved in practice. However, the results reveal that damage risk is not totally eliminated and that there may still be locations where the material may rupture.}

abstract = {Objective Digital pathology (DP) is moving into Danish pathology departments at high pace. Conventionally, biomedical laboratory scientists (BLS) and technicians have prepared tissue sections for light microscopy, but workflow alterations are required for the new digital era with whole slide imaging (WSI); digitally assisted image analysis (DAIA) and artificial intelligence (AI). We aim to explore the role of BLS in DP and assess a potential need for professional development. Methods We investigated the roles of BLS in the new digital era through qualitative interviews at Danish Pathology Departments in 2019/2020 before DP implementation (supported by a questionnaire); and in 2022 after DP implementation. Additionally, senior lecturers from three Danish University Colleges reported on how DP was integrated into the 2023 bachelor’s degree educational curricula for BLS students. Results At some Danish pathology departments, BLS were involved in the implementation process of DP and their greatest concerns were lack of physical laboratory requirements (69%) and implementation strategies (63%). BLS were generally positive towards working with DP, however, some expressed concern about extended working hours for scanning. Work-task transfers from pathologists were generally greeted positively from both management and pathologists; however, at follow-up interviews after DP implementation, job transfers had not been effectuated. At Danish university colleges, DP had been integrated systematically in the curricula for BLS students, especially WSI. Conclusion Involving BLS in DP implementation and development may benefit the process, as BLS have a hands-on workflow perspective with a focus on quality assurance. Several new work opportunities for BLS may occur with DP including WSI, DAIA and AI, and therefore new qualifications are warranted, which must be considered in future undergraduate programmes for BLS students or postgraduate programmes for BLS.}

abstract = {The objective of this research was to investigate the effects of material models, element types, and boundary conditions on the consistency of finite element analysis. Two cantilever beams were used; one made of stainless steel SUS301 3/4H and the other made of polymer polyoxymethylene. The load–deflection curves of the two cantilever beams obtained by experiments were compared to those obtained by finite element analysis, where the material models—including bilinear, trilinear, and multi-linear—were used. Four element types—beam, plane stress, shell, and solid—were also employed with the material models to obtain the simulated load–deflection curves of the cantilever beams. It was found that bilinear material models had the stiffest behavior due to their overestimated yield strength. In addition, by applying a finite displacement to simulate the grip of the cantilever beams, the discrepancy between the simulated permanent set and the experimental set could be reduced from 80% to 5%. To sum up, both the selection of the material model and the setup of the boundary conditions are critical for obtaining good agreement between the finite element analysis results and the experimental data.}

abstract = {The purpose of this article is twofold: to theoretically assess ideational and organizational explanatory factors in the adoption of artificial intelligence policies; and to examine the extent to which the European Union has managed to facilitate a coordinated artificial intelligence policy in the Nordic countries. The study utilizes a mixed-methods approach based on systematic web searching, systematic policy document analysis and key informant semi-structured interviews. The study finds that the European Union has utilized framing-based strategies to set an agenda for a coordinated European artificial intelligence policy. Moreover, the strategy has affected member-state artificial intelligence policies to the extent that key tenets of European Union artificial intelligence discourse have penetrated Nordic public documents. However, the extent to which the Nordic countries incorporate European Union artificial intelligence policy discourse diverges at the national level. Differentiated national organizational capacities among Nordic countries make the adoption of artificial intelligence policies divergent. This observation is theoretically accounted for through a conversation between organizational theory of public governance and discursive institutionalism. The study argues that the framing of European Union artificial intelligence policies is filtered through organizational structures among states. Points for practitioners The study illuminates how policymakers in the Nordic countries are affected by the European Union when crafting their own artificial intelligence policies. The European Commission profoundly influences the policymaking of member states and affiliated states through the policy strategy of policy framing. The Commission uses this soft measure to nudge member states to comply with the European Union policy framework. Second, the study shows how ‘organizations matter’: variation in national organizational capacities in the Nordic states contributes to variation in national policy adoption. Even though Nordic countries adopt European Union-level policy frames, their implementation is shaped by varying organizational capacities available at the national level.}

abstract = {Evaluation of cell response to mechanical stimuli at in vitro conditions is known as one of the important issues for modulating cell behavior. Mechanical stimuli, including mechanical vibration and oscillatory fluid flow, act as important biophysical signals for the mechanical modulation of stem cells. In the present study, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) consists of cytoplasm, nucleus, actin, and microtubule. Also, integrin and primary cilium were considered as mechanoreceptors. In this study, the combined effect of vibration and oscillatory fluid flow on the cell and its components were investigated using numerical modeling. The results of the FEM and FSI model showed that the cell response (stress and strain values) at the frequency of mechanical vibration has the highest value. The achieved results on shear stress caused by the fluid flow on the cell showed that the cell experiences shear stress in the range of . Mechanoreceptors that bind separately to the cell surface, can be highly stimulated by hydrodynamic pressure and, therefore, can play a role in the mechanical modulation of MSCs at in vitro conditions. The results of this research can be effective in future studies to optimize the conditions of mechanical stimuli applied to the cell culture medium and to determine the mechanisms involved in mechanotransduction.}

abstract = {Making is a movement present in the United States which fosters creativity and invention through the creation and sharing of products. This case study of one Western Pennsylvania school district’s integration of Making into its lower and upper secondary schools shows how the investment in space and equipment, guided by visionary leadership, can bring about innovation. Our findings after year 1 of this 2-year project indicate that Elizabeth Forward School District has been successful in fostering an atmosphere where students and teachers are given permission to fail, thereby allowing for experimentation, exploration, and the integration of girls into this normally male-dominated field.}

abstract = {Experimental characterization of time-dependent properties for rectangular hollowcored, continuous fiber reinforced, commingled recycled plastic extruded forms under long-term (creep) flexural loading has been presented in this paper. Finite element based computer models have been developed to predict the effects of damage progression in such reinforced extruded plastic forms. In the long-term (creep) tests, reinforced and unreinforced extrusions with varying compositions were used as specimens. These extruded specimens were submerged in heated water and subjected to different loads. Experimental results indicate that fiber micro-buckling and fiber–matrix interface failure occur during the creep loading environment. The fiber micro-buckling occurs over time, compared with similar but dramatic damage that occurs in a short-period of time during short-term (static) loading, as discussed in Part I of this work. Experimental data also shows that these damage modes significantly reduce the long-term (life cycle) flexural properties, and the specimens with a coupling agent demonstrated much better performance. “Damage dependent” finite element models were developed using different material property types to represent the glass-fiber roving, fiber–matrix interface and plastic matrix respectively. Material nonlinearity of the plastic matrix has been incorporated along with stress-based failure criteria to account for fiber–matrix interfacial shear failure and local fiber micro-buckling. A user-defined material model has been incorporated into an industrial standard finite element software package to accommodate damage progression. The developed finite element based model(s) have correlated well with the long-term (creep) test results, and can provide a valuable tool in designing reinforced plastics for long-term loading conditions.}
