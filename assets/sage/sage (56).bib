abstract = {In this study, we applied different text-mining methods to the originality scoring of the Unusual Uses Test (UUT) and Just Suppose Test (JST) from the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT)–Verbal. Responses from 102 and 123 participants who completed Form A and Form B, respectively, were scored using three different text-mining methods. The validity of these scoring methods was tested against TTCT’s manual-based scoring and a subjective snapshot scoring method. Results indicated that text-mining systems are applicable to both UUT and JST items across both forms and students’ performance on those items can predict total originality and creativity scores across all six tasks in the TTCT-Verbal. Comparatively, the text-mining methods worked better for UUT than JST. Of the three text-mining models we tested, the Global Vectors for Word Representation (GLoVe) model produced the most reliable and valid scores. These findings indicate that creativity assessment can be done quickly and at a lower cost using text-mining approaches.}

abstract = {Current theory has divided memory into multiple systems, resulting in a fractionated account of human behaviour. By an alternative perspective, memory is a single system. However, debate over the details of different single-system theories has overshadowed the converging agreement among them, slowing the reunification of memory. Evidence in favour of dividing memory often takes the form of dissociations observed in amnesia, where amnesic patients are impaired on some memory tasks but not others. The dissociations are taken as evidence for separate explicit and implicit memory systems. We argue against this perspective. We simulate two key dissociations between classification and recognition in a computational model of memory, A Theory of Nonanalytic Association. We assume that amnesia reflects a quantitative difference in the quality of encoding. We also present empirical evidence that replicates the dissociations in healthy participants, simulating amnesic behaviour by reducing study time. In both analyses, we successfully reproduce the dissociations. We integrate our computational and empirical successes with the success of alternative models and manipulations and argue that our demonstrations, taken in concert with similar demonstrations with similar models, provide converging evidence for a more general set of single-system analyses that support the conclusion that a wide variety of memory phenomena can be explained by a unified and coherent set of principles.}

Eighteen second-grade classrooms were randomly assigned to treatment or control conditions. A cluster randomized controlled trial was employed, with 294 students nested within classrooms and classrooms nested within condition. The Sci2 program was implemented for a total of 10 lessons (5 hr) in treatment classrooms, whereas control classrooms provided business-as-usual science instruction. Overall treatment effects were observed on three of four science outcome measures. The reported effects were moderate to large, with effect sizes (Hedges’ g) ranging from 0.48 to 0.94. Moderation analyses indicated that science knowledge at pretest did not moderate Sci2’s effects. Implications for practice and research are discussed.}

Third and fourth graders were asked to find estimates for two-digit addition problems (e.g., 52 + 39). Children were tested in three conditions: (1) time-unlimited visual, (2) time-limited visual, or (3) time-limited auditory conditions. Moreover, we assessed children’s working-memory updating and arithmetic fluency. Children were told which strategy to use on each problem to assess arithmetic performance while executing strategies, in Experiment 1, and were asked to choose the best strategy of three available strategies to assess strategy selection, in Experiment 2. Presentation modality influenced strategy execution (i.e., children were faster and more accurate in problems under visual than auditory conditions) but only in children with low updating abilities. In contrast, presentation modality had no effect on children’s strategy selection. Presentation duration had an effect on both strategy execution and strategy selection with time-limited presentation leading to a decline in children’s performance. Interestingly, specifically in children with low updating abilities, time-limited presentation led to poorer performance. Hence, efficient updating seemed to compensate for detrimental effects of auditory in comparison to visual and time-limited in comparison to time-unlimited presentation. These findings have important implications for determining conditions under which children execute strategies most efficiently and select the best strategy on each problem most often, as well as for understanding mechanisms underlying strategic behaviour.}

The focus of this research is on how the issue of naturalization of Syrians as Turkish citizens has been presented in Turkish newspapers and to what extent the dominant perspective on the issue has shifted over time. For our computational textual analysis of Turkish newspaper materials published between 2012 and 2019, we compiled a corpus consisting of 15,276 news items from four newspapers featuring the co-occurrence of the words “Syria*” (Suriye*) and “citizen*” (vatandaş*) in the main body of their text. The newspapers include mainstream and pro-government (Milliyet with liberal tendencies, Sabah with center-right tendencies), and left-wing (Sol, Evrensel) perspectives. A two-step textual analysis was conducted on the corpus. First, dictionary-based topic modeling was used to chart which broader topics Turkish citizenship of Syrians is predominantly linked to the data, and how the predominance of topics shifted over time. Second, a collocation analysis of the word “refugee” (mülteci) yields a more fine-grained picture of the specific words and expressions that tend to appear often when Syrian refugees are discussed. In both steps, an aggregated general analysis was complemented with separate newspaper-specific analyses, thus allowing for the comparison of different newspapers. Findings show that Syrians in Turkey predominantly feature in the context of diplomatic and societal topics. While mainstream news sources approach the issue less critically, left-wing newspapers show more sensitivity to migrant rights in Turkey.}

abstract = {This article is a case-based review that introduces applied statisticians to a number of issues and methods that arise in clinical studies with paired digital images as outcomes. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is the imaging modality used in two examples. The first is a physical simulation of relevant clinical features of SPECT images using a customized head phantom scanned under different experimental conditions. The objective is to demonstrate and compare several current methods for image registration, i.e., image superimposition in some optimal manner to obtain a common frame of reference within which to make pixel-by-pixel comparisons. Image registration together with image normalization to correct for spurious differences in background activity levels enable quantification of differences in paired images. The physical simulation assesses quantification accuracy. The second example involves two SPECT images of the same brain tumour patient taken about two months apart. The objective here is to demonstrate several tools from morphological image analysis for image segmentation, i.e., separation of “figure” and “ground”, and simple image regression to detect patterns of differences in time, again after registration and normalization. The clinical context of both examples helps to keep the review in practical focus and is a useful starting point for descriptions of many standard tools in applied medical image analysis. References to relevant literature are provided for readers wanting to study particular subjects in depth. As medical image analysis becomes more sophisticated, more cost-conscious and scrutinized more intensively, proper attention to the computational and statistical bases for practical conclusions become even more crucial.}

abstract = {Snow-drifting disasters frequently occur in snowy regions with strong winds and can cause traffic interruptions. Cuttings are particularly vulnerable to severe snowdrift disasters, making designing cutting sections in regions prone to drifting snow challenging. To address this issue, a series of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted to study the impact of cutting section parameters on snowdrift development in cuttings with varying depths and slopes. Initially, the wind velocity and wall friction velocity were carefully analyzed in the initial state of the cutting. The evolution process of snow distribution in different cuttings was then compared. Furthermore, the influence of parameters on wind velocity development was analyzed. Based on the flow patterns and snow distribution, cuttings involved in drifting snow disasters can be divided into two types, depending on whether there are vortices in the cutting. When the slope gradient changes from 1/1 to 1/2, the flow in the cutting will not separate and reattach, indicating that the critical slope angle for two types of cutting is 27°. As the slope gradient decreases, the leeward drift will move from the area near the crest to the foot of the slope. Increasing the depth of the cutting not only reduces the accumulation of snow on the road surface but also provides scope to improve the safety reserve capacity of the slopes.}

abstract = {A curriculum enhancement project of embedding MATLAB and Simulink to a mechanical engineering (ME) vibrations and controls course is presented in this paper. MATLAB/Simulink is a popular software tool for vibration analysts and control designers, which is consistently regarded as one of the most in-demand technical skills that employers are looking for. In the past, the ME students at Mississippi State University (MSU) did not have the training opportunity to use MATLAB/Simulink for design and analysis of vibration and control systems. With the support of a teaching grants, the author created an experimental lab section to ask students to design and build vibration and control devices, and integrated these device into his vibrations and controls course. In this study, the author develops a computer lab section based on the implementation of MATLAB/Simulink, which complements with the experimental lab section to provide the students with a full lab experience. The experimental-computational lab allows the students to not only observe and characterize the dynamic response of vibration and control systems through experimental operations and measurements, but also validate experimental results and confirm experimental phenomena through computational analysis. As well as exploring dynamic behaviors of the systems in a variety of conditions through numerical simulations with different settings. An example of student project is presented to show an experimental-computational study conducted by a student team using MATLAB/Simulink software tool and self-developed data acquisition systems based on a base excitation model demonstrated in class. A questionnaire was conducted at the end of that class and results confirms that the implementation of MATLAB/Simulink into the course effectively develops the ME students’ programming skills and strengthens their capacity in modeling, simulating, and analyzing vibration, control, and other dynamic systems. The developed computational lab and the current experimental lab complementarily promote student understanding of principles and concepts conveyed in classroom lectures.}

abstract = {Objectives: This study proposes a computational model to evaluate patient room design layout and features that contribute to patient stability and mitigate the risk of fall. Background: While common fall risk assessment tools in nursing have an acceptable level of sensitivity and specificity, they focus on intrinsic factors and medications, making risk assessment limited in terms of how the physical environment contributes to fall risk. Methods: We use literature to inform a computational model (algorithm) to define the relationship between these factors and the risk of fall. We use a trajectory optimization approach for patient motion prediction. Results: Based on available data, the algorithm includes static factors of lighting, flooring, supportive objects, and bathroom doors and dynamic factors of patient movement. This preliminary model was tested using four room designs as examples of typical room configurations. Results show the capabilities of the proposed model to identify the risk associated with different room layouts and features. Conclusions: This innovative approach to room design evaluation and resulting estimation of patient fall risk show promise as a proactive evidence-based tool to evaluate the relationship of potential fall risk and room design. The development of the model highlights the challenge of heterogeneity in factors and reporting found in the studies of patient falls, which hinder our understanding of the role of the built environment in mitigating risk. A more comprehensive investigation comparing the model with actual patient falls data is needed to further refine model development.}

abstract = {Documents have been increasingly recognised as important objects of investigation in Science and Technology Studies (STS); however, so far, much less attention has been given to the study of documents produced in Digital Humanities. The author proposes therefore to use the method of the ‘STS of documents’ and analyse Feasibility documents that aim to assess technical and design requirements based on research questions and to organise a project workflow. Drawing on the ethnography of King’s Digital Lab, the article investigates Feasibility documents produced by the lab within the Agile-based Software Development Lifecycle framework. The article aims to show that Feasibility documents (1) inform ethnographic work about lab workflow and management and in doing so, are able to capture the interconnectedness of work layers and practices; (2) enable an empirical analysis of digital research projects and the process of translation from research questions, to methods, to technical solutions; (3) are critical structuring objects that structure the research process and relationships between involved actors and are structured by local institutional strategies and decisions. The author conducts a ‘feasibility analysis’ that reveals the project management and development stages: the analytical process (the translation of research questions into technical solutions); the production process (the move from technical and design practices to research answers) and the infrastructure and management process (project workflow and sustainability solutions). Drawing on Agre’s critical technical practice and Digital Humanities’ theories of critical production, the article seeks to shift attention from end-product digital artefacts towards the complex process of their creation, which can unpack a range of social, technological and management issues. In doing so, it also aims to provide a methodological framework for the analysis of documents produced in Digital Humanities that have the potential to unearth new questions about the socio-technical nature of digital production.}

abstract = {Abstract A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics modelling was carried out to investigate effects of variable valve timing (VVT) and variable valve actuation (VVA) on gas exchange and fuel-air mixing processes in a diesel homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine with early fuel injection. Four VVT or VVA strategies were conducted for this study: first, a negative valve overlap (NVO) strategy with fixed exhaust-valve-opening (EVO) and intake-valve-closing (IVC) timings but variable valve lifts, referred to as the NVO strategy; second, the NVO strategy with fixed valve profiles but variable EVO and IVC timings, referred to as the EVO strategy; third, the NVO strategy with fixed valve lifts and fixed EVO and IVC timings but variable exhaust-valve-closing (EVC) and intake-valve-opening timings, referred to as the EVC strategy; fourth, VVA with just variable valve lifts, referred to as the VMAX strategy. The results indicate that suitable NVO settings will enhance in-cylinder tumble and then increase turbulence intensity before compression end, although the increased NVO has a negative contribution to swirl ratio. It was found that reducing valve lifts alone is not an efficient way to retain the residual gas, but the function of reduced valve lifts will become significantly obvious by combining it with increasing NVO. For the effect of NVO on in-cylinder temperature, longer NVO not only will increase in-cylinder temperature because of the higher residual gas rate but also will improve the in-cylinder temperature homogeneity. On lowering the maximum valve lift or increasing the NVO, the unmixed region of the in-cylinder charge shrinks. The fuel-rich region expands because of the high intake velocity and enhanced turbulence intensity. This is beneficial to the forming of a global homogeneous charge. It has been noted from the current study that, as the droplet distribution may be influenced more by the in-cylinder air motion caused by NVO when the average droplet size is smaller, it is recommended that future studies explore the effects of VVT and VVA on diesel HCCI mixing and combustion with various advanced fuel injection strategies.}

We discuss two use cases: scientific reproducibility of results in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM—previously ACME) and performance reproducibility in molecular dynamics workflows on HPC platforms. To capture and persist the provenance and performance data of these workflows, we have designed and developed the Chimbuko and ProvEn frameworks. Chimbuko captures provenance and enables detailed single workflow performance analysis. ProvEn is a hybrid, queryable system for storing and analyzing the provenance and performance metrics of multiple runs in workflow performance analysis campaigns. Workflow provenance and performance data output from Chimbuko can be visualized in a dynamic, multilevel visualization providing overview and zoom-in capabilities for areas of interest. Provenance and related performance data ingested into ProvEn is queryable and can be used to reproduce runs. Our provenance-based approach highlights challenges in extracting information and gaps in the information collected. It is agnostic to the type of provenance data it captures so that both the reproducibility of scientific results and that of performance can be explored with our tools.}

abstract = {Abstract Numerical simulation of three-dimensional dynamic stall (DS) of helicopter rotor blades has been undertaken using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on the Navier-Stokes equations. The CFD method has been carefully validated against experimental data before being used to study the topology of the three-dimensional DS vortex and the effects of yaw and rotation on its shape and trajectory. The three-dimensional unsteady viscous computations were found to give a wealth of results at the expense of significant amounts of CPU time. To alleviate this problem and to develop a faster model for the aerodynamic loads encountered during three-dimensional DS, a neural network (NN) was put forward. The NN was trained using both CFD and experimental data and was subsequently used as a method for interpolating DS loads between known states for which CFD data were available. The NN was found to work well for such interpolations, although its capability to extrapolate outside the training envelope was somehow limited. Nevertheless, the NN was found to be a very efficient technique for reconstructing three-dimensional DS and has demonstrated great potential as a method for reducing non-linear aerodynamics to a simple computational model.}

abstract = {A fast computational method of the aerodynamic characteristics of fan and booster with inlet distortion is developed in this paper. This method is based on a time-marching throughflow model, and the governing equations are circumferentially averaged Navier-Stokes equations. A model of distributed inviscid blade force and viscid blade force is adopted to reproduce the flow deflection and loss. The deviation angle and loss parameters are interpolated from a database which is extracted from 3-D simulation results of compressor with uniform inlet. After a validation case is performed, the aerodynamical performances of a multistage fan and booster with inlet radial and circumferential distortion are computed. The results show the predictive ability of this method, and the acceptable computational time cost indicates the future application potential of this method during the design stage of a new turbomachinery.}

abstract = {Fully three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic simulations with detailed combustion chemistry of a turbulent jet ignition system installed in a rapid compression machine are presented. The turbulent jet ignition system is a prechamber-initiated combustion system intended to allow lean-burn combustion in spark ignition internal-combustion engines. In the presented configuration, the turbulent jet ignition prechamber has a volume that is 2% of the volume of the main combustion chamber in the rapid compression machine and is separated from the main chamber by a nozzle containing a single orifice. Four simulations with orifice diameters of 1.0 mm, 1.5 mm, 2.0 mm, and 3.0 mm respectively are presented in order to demonstrate the effect of the orifice diameter on the combustion behavior of the turbulent jet ignition process. Data generated by the simulations is shown including combustion chamber pressures, temperature fields, jet velocities and mass fraction burn durations. From the combustion pressure trace, the jet velocity, and other field data, five distinct phases of the turbulent jet ignition process are identified. These phases are called the compression phase, the prechamber combustion initiation phase, the cold jet phase, the hot jet phase, and the flow reversal phase. The four simulations show that the orifice diameter of 1.5 mm provides the fastest ignition and the fastest overall combustion as reflected in the 0–10% and 10–90% mass fraction burn duration data generated. Meanwhile, the simulation for the orifice diameter of 1.0 mm produces the highest jet velocity and has the shortest delay between the spark and the exit of a jet of hot gases into the main chamber but produces a slower burn duration than the simulation for the larger orifice diameter of 1.5 mm. The simulations for orifice diameters of 2.0 mm and 3.0 mm demonstrate that the combustion speed is reduced as the orifice diameter increases above 1.5 mm. Finally, a discussion is given which examines the implications that the results generated have in regard to implementation of the turbulent jet ignition system in an internal-combustion engine.}

abstract = {The multiclass percentile user equilibrium (MCPUE) problem discussed in this paper assumes that travelers, subject to uncertainty in a transportation network, strive to minimize reserved travel time (also known as the travel time budget) to ensure a probability of arriving at their destinations on time. An MCPUE, defined as an extension of the Wardrop equilibrium in a probabilistic network, is achieved when no travelers, regardless of their preferred on-time arrival probability, can reduce their reserved travel time by unilaterally changing their routes. Efficient numerical procedures for computing the MCPUE are studied in this paper. Specifically, a proposed new gradient projection algorithm avoids path enumeration through a column generation procedure based on a reliable shortest path algorithm. Implementation details of inner iterations, which are critical to the overall efficiency of the algorithm, are also discussed. Numerical experiments are conducted to test the computational performance of the proposed algorithm.}
