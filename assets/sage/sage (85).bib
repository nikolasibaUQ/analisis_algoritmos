abstract = {Lime stabilization is a common technique used to improve the engineering properties of clayey soils. The process of lime stabilization can be split into two parts. First, the mobilization and crowding of ions or molecules from hydrated lime at net negative surface charge sites on expansive clay colloids. Second, the formation of pozzolanic products including calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) because of reactions within lime-soil mixtures. The pozzolanic reaction is generally considered to be more durable, while the adsorption has been associated with more easily reversible consistency changes. This study offers a protocol to assess whether the stabilization process is dominated by durable C-S-H (pozzolanic) reactions or a combination of cation exchange and pozzolanic reactions. Expansive clays with plasticity indices >45% from a major highway project in Texas are the focus of lime treatment in this study. The protocol consists of subjecting lime-soil mixtures to a reasonable curing period followed by a rigorous but realistic durability test and investigating the quality and quantity of the pozzolanic reaction product. Mineralogical analyses using quantitative X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicates the formation of different forms of C-S-H. In addition, geochemical modeling is used to simulate the lime-soil reactions and evaluate the effect of pH on the stability of C-S-H. The results indicate C-S-H with Ca/Si ratio of 0.66 as most the stable form of C-S-H among other forms with Ca/Si ratio ranging from 0.66 to 2.25. The effect of reducing equilibrium pH on C-S-H is also evaluated. A reduction in pH favored dissolution of all forms of C-S-H indicating the need to maintain a pH ≥ 10.}

abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 has been highly susceptible to mutations since its emergence in Wuhan, China, and its subsequent propagation due to containing an RNA as its genome. The emergence of variants with improved transmissibility still poses a grave threat to global health. The spike protein mutation is mainly responsible for higher transmissibility and risk severity. This study retrieved SARS-CoV-2 variants structural and nonstructural proteins (NSPs) sequences from several geographic locations, including Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, and North and South America. First, multiple sequence alignments with BioEdit and protein homology modeling were performed using the SWISS Model. Then the structure visualization and structural analysis were performed by superimposing against the Wuhan sequence by Pymol to retrieve the RMSD values. Sequence alignment revealed familiar, uncommon regional among variants and, interestingly, a few unique mutations in Beta, Delta, and Omicron. Structural analysis of such unique mutations revealed that they caused structural deviations in Beta, Delta, and Omicron spike proteins. In addition, these variants were more severe in terms of hospitalization, sickness, and higher mortality, which have a substantial relationship with the structural deviations because of those unique mutations. Such evidence provides insight into the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein vulnerability toward mutation and their structural and functional deviations, particularly in Beta, Delta, and Omicron, which might be the cause of their broader coverage. This knowledge can help us with regional vaccine strain selection, virus pathogenicity testing, diagnosis, and treatment with more specific vaccines.}

abstract = {Minimum miscibility pressure is the least required pressure for complete mixing of gas and oil in the reservoir conditions. It is an important parameter in the processes of gas injection in a miscible manner and its precise determination is very vital in choosing the type of injecting gas and planning injecting equipment for increasing the recovery efficiency. The common method is determining MMP in slim tube or 1-D simulation of slim tube. Usually determining the minimum miscibility pressure via slim tube apparatus is an expensive and time-consuming test and to carry it out it is necessary to have a sample of reservoir oil and suggested injecting gas. Occasionally it is possible that for some unknown reasons despite spending much time and money it won’t bring up any result. As a result, for determining this parameter, finding another method which has a higher precision in addition to being swift and less expensive is very necessary. On the other hand, there are several simulation methods to determine minimum miscibility pressure. These methods are so fast rather than slim tube experiment and relatively precise. MMP can be estimated numerically using compositional simulation, method of characteristics (MOC), mixing-cell methods, intelligent methods, and empirical correlations. However, nowadays one dimensional (1-D) slim tube simulation based on compositional simulation is very common. In this paper a suggestive method is proposed for determining MMP. A mixing rule method coupled with artificial neural network model (ANN) based on a numerous experiment data. Accuracy and computational time of artificial neural network method were compared to common prior models and correlations. The results show although intelligent methods are so fast, 1-D slim tube simulation is still a proper method to determine MMP in high accuracy. Average absolute relative error for MMP value is 1.5% for 1-D slim tube simulation, while the number for ANN is 3.25%. However, ANN method is recommended for fast MMP estimation.}

abstract = {This paper argues that analyses of the ways in which Big Data has been enacted in other academic disciplines can provide us with concepts that will help understand the application of Big Data to social questions. We use examples drawn from our Science and Technology Studies (STS) analyses of -omic biology and high energy physics to demonstrate the utility of three theoretical concepts: (i) primary and secondary inscriptions, (ii) crafted and found data, and (iii) the locus of legitimate interpretation. These help us to show how the histories, organisational forms, and power dynamics of a field lead to different enactments of big data. The paper suggests that these concepts can be used to help us to understand the ways in which Big Data is being enacted in the domain of the social sciences, and to outline in general terms the ways in which this enactment might be different to that which we have observed in the ‘hard’ sciences. We contend that the locus of legitimate interpretation of Big Data biology and physics is tightly delineated, found within the disciplinary institutions and cultures of these disciplines. We suggest that when using Big Data to make knowledge claims about ‘the social’ the locus of legitimate interpretation is more diffuse, with knowledge claims that are treated as being credible made from other disciplines, or even by those outside academia entirely.}

Participants were 15 6th grade secondary school students enrolled in an IT course at a public secondary school. Observations, screenshots and interviews were analyzed together to find out what students do and what they think during problem solving process. As a result, three main steps (focus, fight and finalize) were extracted from students’ behavioral patterns. The results suggest that three steps occur in linear or cyclic manner with regard to the programming constructs required for the solution of the problem. Implications for instructors who desire to provide a better learning experience on problem solving through block-based programming are also included.}

abstract = {This article reviews some of the recent work on the remarkable cognitive capacities of food-caching corvids. The focus will be on their ability to think about other minds and other times, and tool-using tests of physical problem solving. Research on developmental cognition suggests that young children do not pass similar tests until they are at least four years of age in the case of the social cognition experiments, and eight years of age in the case of the tasks that tap into physical cognition. This developmental trajectory seems surprising. Intuitively, one might have thought that the social and planning tasks required more complex forms of cognitive process, namely Mental Time Travel and Theory of Mind. Perhaps the fact that children pass these tasks earlier than the physical problem-solving tasks is a reflection of cultural influences. Future research will hope to identify these cognitive milestones by starting to develop tasks that might go some way towards understanding the mechanisms underlying these abilities in both children and corvids, to explore similarities and differences in their ways of thinking.}

abstract = {Owing to the limited installation space and duct size, coupled fittings are common in the duct systems of buildings. The coupling effect leads to changes in drag and fan energy consumption. This study investigates duct drag and flow field characteristics under coupling conditions. Experiments and numerical simulations with the Reynolds stress model are conducted. Flow field changes, flow field deformation, and drag changes in the duct are analyzed. Regardless of the coupling form, the velocity near the inner arc is fast, whereas that near the outer arc is slow. Under three different coupling connection conditions (S-shaped, L-shaped, and U-shaped), the outlet velocity gradient of the U-shaped coupling connection is the least obvious. After the fluid flows through the bend, a significant centerline velocity reduction can be observed, even greater than that in the bend. The lowest centerline velocity lies within the range of 2.5 D to 4.5 D after the bend. Coupling connection has an insignificant effect on upstream duct resistance. The resistance of single bend is less than that of the downstream bend for the coupled bend and greater than that of the upstream bend under coupling conditions. Practical application: Coupling effect is common in practical application of ventilation engineering. This effect leads to the change of fluid resistance loss of ducts and pipes. However, few researchers focus on this effect. This study finds that regardless of the coupling form, the velocity near the inner arc is fast, whereas that near the outer arc is slow. It means the guide vane should be set near inner arc. L-shaped coupling connection has the largest downstream piping resistance. The resistance of the downstream piping under S-shaped coupling is the least, thus L-shaped coupling connection should be avoided as far as possible in practical application.}

abstract = {Leaders have been classified as having charismatic, ideological, or pragmatic (CIP) leadership styles, each characterized by distinct patterns in cognition and interaction. Although each CIP style has been shown to facilitate certain aspects of the creative process for followers, questions remain regarding the impact of leadership style on overall follower creative performance. One factor likely to influence this relationship is leader distance, composed of the physical distance, perceived social distance, and perceived task interaction among leaders and followers. Past research has also emphasized the role of leaders’ mental models as they relate to follower performance. Less understood, however, is how the mental models of followers may affect this process. Using the CIP model of leadership, this study explores leader distance and leader–follower mental model congruence on follower creative performance. Results indicated that while leadership style does not directly influence follower creativity, it interacts with leader distance to shape creative outcomes. Results further indicated that while general mental model congruence is not predictive, alignment on specific mental model dimensions contributes to enhanced creative performance among followers. Implications and future research directions are discussed.}

Specifically, we examined the responsiveness of 260 seventh grade students identified as MD or MDRD to a 6-week treatment (SBI) on measures of proportional problem solving. Results indicated that students in the SBI condition significantly outperformed students in the control condition on a measure of proportional problem solving administered at posttest (g = 0.40) and again 6 weeks later (g = 0.42). The interaction between treatment group and students’ difficulty status was not significant, which indicates that SBI was equally effective for both students with MD and those with MDRD. Further analyses revealed that SBI was particularly effective at improving students’ performance on items related to percents. Finally, students with MD significantly outperformed students with MDRD on all measures of proportional problem solving. These findings suggest that interventions designed to include effective instructional features (e.g., SBI) promote student understanding of mathematical ideas.}

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to perform an in silico evaluation of bovine meat proteins as potential precursors of biologically active peptides, as well as to determine whether such peptides can be released by selected proteolytic enzymes. The sequences of 19 bovine meat proteins were processed using the BIOPEP database and program. The profiles of potential biological activity of protein fragments were determined and the following parameters were calculated: the frequency of occurrence of fragments with given activity (A), the frequency of release of fragments with given activity by selected enzymes (AE), and the relative frequency of release of fragments with given activity by selected enzymes (W). Among the examined proteins, collagen and elastin appear to be the richest potential source of bioactive peptides, in particular of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, antithrombotic fragments, inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase IV and peptides regulating gastric mucosal activity. The high number of bioactive fragments in collagen and elastin is associated with a high content of glycine and proline, amino acids that are most abundant in biologically active fragments. Of the two investigated proteolytic enzymes, Proteinase K — an enzyme with broad specificity (e.g., against peptide bonds formed by the carboxyl groups of proline) can release considerably more biologically active fragments than Proteinase P1 — an enzyme with narrow specificity, not including proline residues.}

This research suggests that future computational design algorithms could benefit from incorporating scenario-based methods developed in the field of evidence-based design, in which studies are concerned about improving qualitative goals. Through this case study, we describe the process of prototyping a computational design algorithm based on the Functional Scenario Analysis approach, applying the algorithm to evaluate case studies, visualizing findings, and extracting design strategies based on the analysis results. This method offers a new vision of how computational design can benefit informed decision-making processes and generate design alternatives aligned with a project’s design goals.}

As the number of sequences increases, the length of time taken to complete an MCMC analysis increases as well. Here, we investigate an approach to distribute the MCMC analysis across a cluster of computers. To do this, we use bootstrapped topologies as fixed genealogies, perform a single MCMC analysis on each genealogy without topological rearrangements, and pool the results across all MCMC analyses. We show, through simulations, that although the standard MCMC performs better than the bootstrap-MCMC at estimating the effective population size (scaled by mutation rate), the bootstrap-MCMC returns better estimates of growth rates. Additionally, we find that our bootstrap-MCMC analyses are, on average, 37 times faster for equivalent effective sample sizes.}

abstract = {In this article, noise spectrum of marine propellers is investigated in uniform flow under non-cavitating and cavitating conditions. New results are presented for this research field. Hydrodynamic performance of both non-cavitating and cavitating marine propellers is first analyzed by viscous and potential based flow solvers. In viscous solver, sheet cavitation on propeller blades is simulated with Schnerr–Sauer cavitation model based on Rayleigh Plesset equation using volume of fluid approach. Numerical hydrodynamic results based on viscous solver is compared with potential solver and then validated with experimental data of benchmark David Taylor Model Basin 4119 model propeller. Later, noise spectrum of model propellers is predicted by a hybrid method which combines Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes and Ffowcs Williams Hawkings equations. Computed noise spectrum is compared with other numerical studies in the literature for the selected model propeller. In addition, hydrodynamic and hydroacoustic pressures are compared in near field to show reliability of numerical solution. Effects of blade number on hydrodynamic performance and noise spectrum are also investigated. Numerical results indicated that as blade number increases, propeller noise level decreases for different loading conditions due to decreased blade loading (circulation) per blade. However, propeller efficiency increases as blade number decreases.}

abstract = {In this paper, steady, laminar, incompressible, and two-dimensional micropolar flow between a porous disk and a nonporous disk is considered. By introducing suitable similarity transformations, the problem is reduced to a set of nonlinear boundary value problems. Optimal homotopy asymptotic method is employed to obtain the series solutions for velocity and microrotation distribution. The accuracy of results is examined by the fourth-order Runge–Kutta numerical method. The results are presented to study the velocity and rotation profiles for different physical parameters such as: Reynolds number, vortex viscosity parameter, spin gradient viscosity, and microinertia density parameter. As a result, the magnitude of the injection velocity has strong influence on the flow velocities and the microrotation.}

abstract = {Understanding differences in the genetic architecture of complex traits between the two sexes has significant implications for evolutionary studies and clinical diagnosis. However, our knowledge about sex-specific genetic architecture is limited largely because of a lack of analytical models that can detect and quantify the effects of sex on the complexity of quantitative genetic variation. Here, we derived a statistical model for mapping DNA sequence variants that contribute to sex-specific differences in allele frequencies, linkage disequilibria, and additive and dominance genetic effects due to haplotype diversity. This model allows a genome-wide search for functional haplotypes and the estimation and test of haplotype by sex interactions and sex-specific heritability. The model, validated by simulation studies, was used to detect sex-specific functional haplotypes that encode a pain sensitivity trait in humans. The model could have important implications for mapping complex trait genes and studying the detailed genetic architecture of sex-specific differences.}
