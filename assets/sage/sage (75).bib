abstract = {Abstract An overview over flamelet modelling for turbulent non-premixed combustion is given. A short review of previous contributions to simulations of direct injection (DI) diesel engine combustion using the representative interactive flamelet concept is presented. A surrogate fuel consisting of 70 per cent (liquid volume) n-decane and 30 per cent α-methyl-naphthalene is experimentally compared to real diesel fuel. The resemblance of their physical and chemical properties is shown to result in very similar combustion and pollutant formation for both fuels. In order to account for variations of the scalar dissipation rate within the computational domain, a method using multiple flamelets, called the Eulerian particle flamelet model, is used. A strategy is described for subdividing the computational domain and assigning the resulting subdomains to different flamelet histories represented by Eulerian marker particles. Experiments conducted with an Audi DI diesel engine and diesel fuel are compared to simulations using the surrogate fuel. The use of multiple flamelets, each having a different history, significantly improves the description of the ignition phase, leading to a better prediction of pressure, heat release and exhaust emissions of soot and NOx. The effect of the number of flamelet particles on the predictions is discussed.}

abstract = {This study tested the hypothesis that individual differences in generalized control perception for 43 undergraduate adults may be reflected in Spontaneous Eye Blink Rates during conversation in an interview. Control perception was assessed by means of Rotter’s internal-external Locus of Control questionnaires, while Spontaneous Eye Blink Rates were computed from filmed videos of interviews consisting of a series of questions which could presumably have triggered different mental states. Pearson correlations and linear regression analyses indicated that the individual differences in Spontaneous Eye Blink Rates did not differ significantly across different questions, but that Spontaneous Eye Blink Rates measured over the entire interview correlated positively and significantly with an internal Locus of Control (r = .26). This could be interpreted as modest but corroborative evidence that a personality trait reflecting control perception may have a biological component. The possible roles of dopamine neurotransmission and frontal cortex involvement in higher cognition and Locus of Control are discussed.}

abstract = {This article describes an efficient algorithm based on residual power series to approximate the solution of a class of partial differential equations of time-fractional Fokker–Planck model. The fractional derivative is assumed in the Caputo sense. The proposed algorithm gives the solution in a form of rapidly convergent fractional power series with easily computable coefficients. It does not require linearization, discretization, or small perturbation. To test simplicity, potentiality, and practical usefulness of the proposed algorithm, illustrative examples are provided. The approximate solutions of time-fractional Fokker–Planck equations are obtained by the residual power series method are compared with those obtained by other existing methods. The present results and graphics reveal the ability of residual power series method to deal with a wide range of partial fractional differential equations emerging in the modeling of physical phenomena of science and engineering.}

abstract = {With emergent subspecialties like data journalism bringing new skillsets and job roles, professionals and journalism educators find it difficult to imbibe the fast-changing industry demands. Such challenges in some countries and media industries put journalism educators in an advantageous position, offering them an agency to actively shape the contours of industry practice than getting shaped by it. From this perspective, the present study tries to understand data journalism practices in India and suggests certain insights to integrate data journalism training in programmes offered by Indian journalism education. By probing insights from the literature on data journalism education and by examining existing data journalism practices in India, the study calls for intervention with a pedagogic strategy to impart better data-sourcing practices, coding skills and critical data literacy among the students as an antidote to the prevalent DIY culture and overdependence on data aggregates. The pedagogic strategy should convey the importance of audience centrality and ethics in data journalism practice. It argues that such an approach can, in effect, improve industry practices as well as the quality of journalism education in India.}

abstract = {Group hole nozzles (GHN) are injector tips with clusters of small holes used in place of a single large hole. In this work, GHN with two holes per cluster and a diverging angle of 15° between the holes were studied using experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and comparisons were made with conventional diesel injectors. First, experiments were performed in a high temperature pressure vessel (HTPV) to understand the free spray behavior. HTPV experiments revealed that the diverging GHN had slower penetration with a more dispersed spray and a shorter lift-off length relative to the conventional injector. The GHN also exhibited higher natural luminosity compared to the conventional injector, which is indicative of increased soot formation with the GHN. CFD model validated with HTPV experimental data was used to study the sensitivity to the angle between the holes and the hole count per cluster. Results showed that soot formation increased as the divergence angle increased from 0° to 15°. Furthermore, as the divergence angle increased, increasing the hole count per cluster increased the soot formation significantly. Following the HTPV study, the injectors were tested on a single-cylinder heavy-duty diesel engine at a high-load operating condition. Results showed that the diverging GHN injector produced a lower mixing-controlled combustion rate compared to the conventional injector. The slower burn rates resulted in lower NOx and higher soot emissions for the diverging GHN injector. CFD simulations of the engine experiments predicted the slower burn rate seen with the diverging GHN injector. In-cylinder visualization of the CFD results showed that slower penetration with the diverging GHN results in reduced mixing upon surface interaction, and an inability to utilize the fresh air in the outer regions of the combustion chamber which resulted in richer local equivalence ratios and higher soot emissions compared to the conventional injector.}

abstract = {The debate over symbolic versus sub-symbolic representations of human cognition has been continuing for thirty years, with little indication of a resolution. The argument is this: Does the human cognitive system use symbols as a representation of knowledge, and does it process symbols and their respective constituents? Or does the human cognitive system use a distributed representation of knowledge, and is it somehow capable of processing this distributed representation of knowledge in a complex and meaningful way? This paper argues for an integrated symbolic and sub-symbolic approach to the representation of cognition. The lines of reasoning used as evidence to bolster this argument for an integrated approach are the cognitive architecture the Adaptive Character of Thought-Rational (ACT-R), and biology, where it is argued that symbolic and sub-symbolic representations of cognition are part of an intellectual continuum, with sub-symbolic representations at the low end and symbolic representations at the higher end.}

abstract = {In this study, to define the distribution of CO2 and methanol concentration in the anode channel, three-dimensional (3D) two-phase homogeneous computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling for the anode channel and one-dimensional (1D) two-phase mathematical modelling for the porous media have been considered. In the anode channel, two flow configurations, single-serpentine flow field (SSFF), and parallel flow field (PFF) were studied. Here also, the effects of inlet mass flowrate, flow configurations, inlet temperature of aqueous solution, and inlet feed concentration on the CO2 concentration in the anode channel and cell performance have been investigated. To define the interface boundary conditions between the channel and diffuser layers, the CFD modelling of the anode channel was coupled with the mathematical modelling in the porous media. The results show that the corner of the channel rib is the proper site for coalescence of CO2 gas bubbles. The finer distribution of methanol concentration and less number of gas bubbles at the SSFF configuration have been observed. This leads to a better performance of the cell in the SSFF configuration relative to the PFF configuration. With increase of the mass flowrate, the molar concentration of CO2 (gas bubbles) reduces and the cell performance improves. With increase in the temperature of aqueous methanol solution, cell performance will improve. The main reasons should be attributed to the enhanced activity of the catalyst and increase of diffusion coefficient of the methanol solution. The CO2 gas bubbles will emerge more at higher temperatures, but it is clear that the effect of enhanced activity of the catalyst and increase of the diffusion coefficient of the methanol surmounts that of numerous CO2 gas bubbles, thus leading to the improvement of the cell performance.}

In the experimental approach, the performances of the QDSSCs were validated. The properties of the QD-sensitised TiO2 electrode were characterised with FESEM, TEM, EDS, and UV–visible spectroscopy. It was observed that Ag2S–Bi2S3 QDSSC treated with post heat treatment exhibited better efficiency. UV–VIS spectroscopy result showed that the same sample had better absorption below the 570 nm wavelength. Efficiency obtained was at the low side due to charge recombination.}

This review selected and analyzed 17 studies published from 1987 to 2022 in peer-reviewed journals using a rigorous five-stage scoping framework. Data extraction and analysis were conducted in Covidence. The results revealed eight types of technological tools used to enhance creativity in the music classroom, in which sequencer software and GarageBand were the most commonly used type of technological tools and applications respectively. Technology’s support for creativity was also discussed from the perspectives of Lubart’s four roles of computers: (a) computer as nanny, (b) computer as pen-pal, (c) computer as coach, and (d) computer as colleague. The results showed a dearth of research on how technology can become students’ partners to help them generate creative ideas.

abstract = {An engine is being developed to utilise some of the heat of a wood-burning stove to produce a small quantity of electricity. The heat is used to maintain a temperature gradient in a regenerator consisting of very narrow passages in which the gas (air) is in intimate thermal contact with the material. By the thermo-acoustic principle, a strong sound wave can be developed if the regenerator is incorporated in an acoustic loop so that acoustic energy is returned to it and amplified. The excess power generated can be extracted by a linear alternator. This article describes a model of the thermal, acoustic and electrical processes, and a procedure for calculating the performance of a complete loop. Comparison of the computed results with data from three configurations of apparatus shows that the acoustic elements of the problem are quite accurately described. However, there are discrepancies between the calculated thermal and electrical parameters, and the limited measurements for a practically useful arrangement of the components.}

OBJECTIVE: To develop a computational methodology to help assess functional vision in premature infants by tracking iris distances. METHODS: This experimental study was carried out with children up to two years old. A pattern of image capture with the visual stimulus was proposed to evaluate visual functions of vertical and horizontal visual tracking, visual field, vestibulo-ocular reflex, and fixation. The participants’ visual responses were filmed to compose a dataset and develop a detection algorithm using the OpenCV library allied with FaceMesh for the detection and selection of the face, detection of specific facial points and tracking of the iris positions is done. A feasibility study was also conducted from the videos processed by the software. RESULTS: Forty-one children of different ages and diagnoses participated in the experimental study, forming a robust dataset. The software resulted in the tracking of iris positions during visual function evaluation stimuli. Furthermore, in the feasibility study, 8 children participated, divided into Pre-term and Term groups. There was no statistical difference in any visual variable analyzed in the comparison between groups. CONCLUSION: The computational methodology developed was able to track the distances traveled by the iris, and thus can be used to help assess visual function in children.}

abstract = {Peripheral artery stenting (PAS) is an effective alternative for peripheral endarterectomy. Smart stents can be used to minimize the problems of interaction between peripheral arteries and smart stent. To evaluate the biomechanical properties of smart stents and their interactions with the peripheral artery, a 3D nonlinear finite element method (FEM) model that was composed of a peripheral artery and a smart stent was built. The present simulation modeled smart superelasticity material based on thermodynamics of the Helmholtz free energy (Auricchio theory) and Peripheral artery based on hyperelastic models (Mooney-Rivlin and Ogden). Additionally, the present study used FEM to assess the influences of the material properties, strain level, and friction coefficient (with attention to smart stent’s materials properties) of the newly designed smart stent during crimping and its interaction with the peripheral artery. The results showed that the smart stent with high Af: Austenite finish temperature, 90% crimping, and friction coefficient of 0.1 between smart stent and peripheral artery performed better mechanically and clinically, which can be attributed to suitable Chronic Outward Force (COF), high Radial Resistive Force (RRF), whole mechanical hysteresis regarding superelastic performance, the high martensite formation, the low stress on the peripheral artery, and the high strain on the internal curvature of the smart stent and peripheral artery. Moreover, it was found that the Mooney-Rivlin model showed a better mechanical performance that the Ogden model given the distribution of stress and strain level on the peripheral artery. These models were appropriate for the description of the peripheral artery performance and smart stent behavior with considering material properties, strain level, and friction coefficient during the interaction process.}

abstract = {In this paper, we present results from a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model for the mixing process used to disperse synthetic fibers in wet-lay process. We used CFD software, FLUENT, together with the MIXSIM user interface to accurately model the impeller geometry. A multiple reference frame (MRF) model and standard k-e turbulence model were used to model the problem. After obtaining a converged solution for the mixing tank with water, a discrete phase model was constructed by injecting spherical particles into the flow. A mixing tank with baffles and a centrally located impeller was used in experiments. PET fibers (1.5 denier, 6.35, 12.7, and 38.7 mm) at a concentration of 0.01% were mixed in water for the study. In regions behind the baffles, where the model predicted higher concentration of particles, experimental results showed a 34% higher concentration relative to the region in the high turbulence zone near the center. Instantaneous sheets were formed by rapidly dipping and removing a flat wire mesh strainer into the tank at two different locations to assess the state of dispersion in the tank. The sheets were transferred onto a blotting paper and examined under a microscope to count defects. Results show that the number of rope defects was 43% higher in sheets drawn from the region behind the baffles than in the sheets drawn from regions near the center of the tank. Changing baffles from a rectangular to a triangular cross section decreased the number of rope defects, but increased the number of log defects in the sample sheets at the same location. The CFD model can be used to optimize mixing tank design for wet lay fiber dispersion. The model provides further insight into the mixing process by predicting the effect of changes in design parameters on dispersion quality.}

abstract = {Things we can do because of learning are called outcomes of learning. Outcome based education (OBE) was propounded by William Spady in the 90s to bring the focus of formal education to what the students learn rather than what they were taught. OBE is a system of education giving priority to ends, purpose, accomplishments, and results. All decisions about the curriculum, assessment, and instruction are driven by the exit learning outcomes the students should display at the end of a program or a course. This paper presents a method of writing outcomes for General higher education programs. Outcomes for a higher education program are defined at three levels as program outcomes (POs), program specific outcomes (PSOs), and course outcomes (COs). The most important aspect of an outcome is that it should be observable and measurable. These are best written in a well-defined framework of taxonomy of learning. Bloom’s taxonomy of learning identifies three domains of learning: Cognitive, affective and psychomotor. Revised Bloom taxonomy of cognitive domain has two dimensions cognitive levels and knowledge categories. It is proposed that CO statements be written within a well-defined structure: Action, knowledge elements, conditions, and criteria. Tagging COs with POs, PSOs, cognitive levels and the number of classroom hours associated facilitates the computation of attainment of COs, POs, and PSOs.}

It identifies and assesses some challenges to the right to a fair trial that appear in case this kind of tools are employed by judges and parties in judicial proceedings. Further, the article offers a reflection on possible strategies to tackle the identified challenges, including the adoption of the appropriate method to address legal analytics in court procedures, the need for proper training of judges or certification and auditing schemes.}

abstract = {Specific genetic abnormalities (alterations in growth-related genes), either inherited or acquired during lifetimes, may deregulate normal cell growth by interfering with very basic cellular, biochemical and biophysical processes. In order to be able to prevent such unregulated growth of cells, which may lead to cancer, we will have to understand the basic principles of genome organisation better, the mechanisms of genetic information storage, and the molecular structure and functioning of the genes and gene families themselves. This review gives a short overview of the various hierarchical levels at which an attempt is made, using different methods, to collect genomic information relevant to cancer research. We will start with cytogenetic and genetic linkage maps at the lowest resolution, work with ordered clone and complementary DNA libraries and with nucleotide sequences at medium resolution, and investigate fine details of the atomic and electronic structures of the molecules involved at the highest resolution. Very different disciplines – biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, genetics, artificial intelligence research and others – have to cooperate closely in approaching the above-mentioned ambitious goals. One of their common denominators is their intensive use of computers as tools in organising genomic information and in trying to convert it to biological knowledge.}

abstract = {This paper describes a module for the teaching of diffusion to mechanical engineering students that can be part of a course on numerical methods or advanced engineering mathematics and as a precursor to a heat transfer course. The purpose of the module is to pull together many of the mathematical concepts in the early education of mechanical engineering students while at the same time introducing them to other important topics – an application of finite differences to the numerical approximation of partial differential equations, the importance of controlling round-off error in computational algorithms, and the time complexity of some numerical models. Students learn these topics through the execution of computer experiments. The first set of experiments cover the numerical approximation of heat conduction in a ring, and a second set cover the numerical approximation of the reaction and diffusion of chemicals that will produce the markings on an animal’s tail. The learning outcomes of the module are evaluated with data from pre- and post-module surveys given to mechanical engineering students in several sections of a required course in numerical methods.}

abstract = {The flexion effect of a flexible wing during the hovering flight is systematically studied by using computer simulations when Reynolds number is kept at 140. The aerodynamic forces and flow vortex are investigated by solving the two-dimensional time-dependent incompressible Navier–Stokes equations using the finite volume method. The wing is modelled as a thin plate which has a rigid leading portion and a flexible aft part. The simulations are performed for a variation of the location of rotational centre and the amplitude of the flexion, and the corresponding changes of the aerodynamic forces and vortex shedding mechanism in the wake structure are investigated. Form the quantitative comparisons, the present simulations reveal that a moderate flexion during the hovering fly can provide a better performance for a flapping wing, while an excessive flexion will lead the aerodynamic performance become worse. Though the flexion does not change the force trace of the hovering wing, the magnitude of the instantaneous peak forces and mean periodic forces are definitely changed by the chordwise deformation. Compared with a rigid hovering wing, the dynamic flexion during hovering alters the intensity of the leading edge vorticity and the transfer direction of the wake. Here, the present results indicate that the aerodynamic forces can be altered by adding some deformation characteristics to the trailing edge of the wing. Furthermore, the appropriate flexion can be used to alter the aerodynamic performance of a wing and will be helpful for design and control of the flexible microflying vehicles.}
