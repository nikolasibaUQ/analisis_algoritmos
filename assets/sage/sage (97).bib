abstract = {Rapid growth in data, computational methods, and computing power is driving a remarkable revolution in what variously is termed machine learning (ML), statistical learning, computational learning, and artificial intelligence. In addition to highly visible successes in machine-based natural language translation, playing the game Go, and self-driving cars, these new technologies also have profound implications for computational and experimental science and engineering, as well as for the exascale computing systems that the Department of Energy (DOE) is developing to support those disciplines. Not only do these learning technologies open up exciting opportunities for scientific discovery on exascale systems, they also appear poised to have important implications for the design and use of exascale computers themselves, including high-performance computing (HPC) for ML and ML for HPC. The overarching goal of the ExaLearn co-design project is to provide exascale ML software for use by Exascale Computing Project (ECP) applications, other ECP co-design centers, and DOE experimental facilities and leadership class computing facilities.}

abstract = {Indigenous people are significantly underrepresented in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). The solution to this problem requires a more robust lens than representation or access alone. Specifically, it will require careful consideration of the ecological contexts of Indigenous school age youth, of which more than 70% live in urban communities (National Urban Indian Family Coalition, 2008). This article reports emergent design principles derived from a community-based design research project. These emergent principles focus on the conceptualization and uses of technology in science learning environments designed for urban Indigenous youth. In order to strengthen learning environments for urban Indigenous youth, it is necessary, we argue, that scholars and educators take seriously the ways in which culture mediates relationships with, conceptions of, and innovations in technology and technologically related disciplines. Recognizing these relationships will inform the subsequent implications for learning environments.}

abstract = {In this article, we present a study focused on developing students’ understanding the ecology through participation in a technology-supported urban planning simulation—specifically, 11 high school students in Madison, Wisconsin acted as urban planners to redesign a local shopping street using a Geographic Information System (GIS) model. This experimental design was situated within the theory of pedagogical praxis, which suggests that modeling learning environments on authentic professional practices enables youth to develop a deeper understanding of important domains of inquiry (Shaffer, 2004). Results presented here suggest that through participation in the project students: a) developed an understanding of ecology; and b) developed this understanding through the urban planning practices and the features of the GIS model used during the project. Thus, we propose that this augmented by reality learning environment modeled on the professional practices of urban planners extends the theory of pedagogical praxis into the domain of ecology and offers a useful method for developing ecological understanding through participation in simulations that incorporate the authentic tools and practices of urban planning.}

abstract = {Respiratory disease is a significant problem worldwide, and it is a problem with increasing prevalence. Pathology in the upper airways and lung is very difficult to diagnose and treat, as response to disease is often heterogeneous across patients. Computational models have long been used to help understand respiratory function, and these models have evolved alongside increases in the resolution of medical imaging and increased capability of functional imaging, advances in biological knowledge, mathematical techniques and computational power. The benefits of increasingly complex and realistic geometric and biophysical models of the respiratory system are that they are able to capture heterogeneity in patient response to disease and predict emergent function across spatial scales from the delicate alveolar structures to the whole organ level. However, with increasing complexity, models become harder to solve and in some cases harder to validate, which can reduce their impact clinically. Here, we review the evolution of complexity in computational models of the respiratory system, including successes in translation of models into the clinical arena. We also highlight major challenges in modelling the respiratory system, while making use of the evolving functional data that are available for model parameterisation and testing.}

Many of these projects have focused on alternative matter–mind mixtures and in/organic variation, concerned that past theories of sociality have dismissed the vibrancy and animacy of the nonhuman material world. This paper explores the power of speculative fiction to help us rethink empiricism in posthuman ecologies of the Anthropocene, in the midst of post-truth conditions and growing science denialism. We foreground speculative fiction as a way to open up scientific imaginaries, rethinking the relationship between nature, technics, and human “sense” making. We show how such texts offer alternative images of research methods for studying pluralist ecologies and new forms of worldly belonging.}

abstract = {Based on Unconscious Thought Theory (UTT) and a series of experimental and correlational studies, Dijksterhuis and his colleagues conclude that when making complex choices/decisions, conscious thought—deliberation while attention is directed at the problem—leads to poorer choices/decisions than “unconscious thought”—deliberation in the absence of conscious attention directed at the problem. UTT comprises six principles said to apply to decision making, impression formation, attitude formation and change, problem solving, and creativity. Because the implications of UTT for psychological research and theory are considerable, the authors critically examined these six principles (and the studies used to support them) in light of the extant scholarship on unconscious processes, memory, attention, and social cognition. Our examination reveals that UTT is a theory of the unconscious that fails to take into account important work in cognitive psychology, particularly in the judgment and decision making area. Moreover, established literatures in social psychology that contradict fundamental tenets of UTT and its empirical basis are ignored. The authors conclude that theoretical and experimental deficiencies undermine the claims of the superiority of unconscious thinking as portrayed by UTT.}

abstract = {The idea of computational processes, which take place in nature, for example, DNA computation, is discussed in the literature. DNA computation that is going on in the immunoglobulin locus of vertebrates shows how the computations in the biological possibility space could operate during evolution. We suggest that the origin of evolutionarily novel genes and genome evolution constitute the original intrinsic computation of the information about new structures in the space of unrealized biological possibilities. Due to DNA computation, the information about future structures is generated and stored in DNA as genetic information. In evolving ontogenies, search algorithms are necessary, which can search for information about evolutionary innovations and morphological novelties. We believe that such algorithms include stochastic gene expression, gene competition, and compatibility search at different levels of structural organization. We formulate the increase in complexity principle in terms of biological computation and hypothesize the possibility of in silico computing of future functions of evolutionarily novel genes.}

This article analyses educational technology policy in Ireland from 1997 to 2017 and draws attention to an underlying economic agenda for technology integration in schools, set against a backdrop of neoliberal discourses. The study found that the challenge of integrating technology is no longer understood as simply a challenge of “integration” but rather as a realignment of the existing education system toward a more student-centered experience. Most recent policy also recognizes the complex and contextually bound nature of the associated change process suggesting a maturation of understanding in respect of the intersection between technology and education. The article also highlights the symbolic function of policy and the role it plays in representing the educational system in a particular light to national and international audiences. Recognizing the symbolic function of educational technology policy and the neoliberal ideology underpinning it can help identify the reasons for the apparent failures of past attempts to integrate technology in schools as well as informing future policy iterations.}

It is argued that the sciences of complexity have implications for our thinking in mainly three areas. First, they revise our conceptions of systems, causal relations, and determinism and depict a picture of mostly indeterministic reality composed of open systems. Second, they offer an “endophysical” and phenomenological view of system - observer relations. Third, although they are heavily quantitative, they illustrate the importance of qualitative interpretations in quantitative analyses and thus bridge the chasm between quantitative and qualitative methodologies. The insights of the sciences of complexity can help us improve our understanding of the complexities of public policy and administrative processes.}

abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers faced challenges conducting data collection. However, emerging communication technologies, such as web-conferencing platforms, provided an alternative mode of data collection. Among these platforms, Zoom stands out for its functional affordances and unique features that support data collection methods, including screen-capturing, digital photography, drawing, polling, and artifact-based interviews, which attempt to reveal a child’s viewpoint and ability. In this article, we explore the feasibility of using Zoom to conduct educational research by investigating the mathematical learning experience among 26 primary 1 and 2 students in Hong Kong on two topics—understanding time and addition and subtraction. Five mathematics teachers were recruited to participate in 2-month online workshops with assessments among three groups of students to understand the suitability for data collection. Based on teachers’ observations and students’ responses, our findings suggest that Zoom is a viable and effective tool for qualitative data collection. It offers a cost-effective method for researchers and educators to examine students’ mathematical performance in an online environment. We also investigate students’ perceptions of online assessment strategies, perceived usefulness of various Zoom functions, and explore the benefits and challenges teachers and students perceived throughout mathematical education using Zoom. However, several technical difficulties were encountered, such as the digital literacy gap and privacy concerns. Therefore, improving students’ digital literacy for remote learning and triangulation is important for online mathematical data collection and assessments.}

abstract = {Information technology and computer science represent one area of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) that have experienced significant growth in recent years. As such, federal policy has urged schools to embed new types of STEM courses into the curriculum. As one very prominent example, computer science (CS)-focused courses are a growing branch of career and technical education (CTE)—that is, CS-CTE. While previous research has examined coursetaking patterns and subsequent outcomes of CS-CTE courses for the general student population, little is known about how participation in these courses may benefit students with learning disabilities (SWLDs). From a pedagogical perspective, CS-CTE courses, and CTE courses in general, may be uniquely positioned to improve schooling outcomes for SWLDs. Using data from the nationally representative High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, we explored characteristics of CS-CTE participants, how CS-CTE may promote the development of key STEM attitudes (e.g., identity, self-efficacy, and utility), and how any relationships may differ by learning disability status. Using a double propensity score matching estimations, we found CS-CTE participation related to positive development of STEM identity and STEM self-efficacy for students without learning disabilities. For the SWLD population, CS-CTE participation was associated with growth in STEM self-efficacy and STEM utility. Policy implications discuss the gap in computer science employment between SWLDs and non-SWLDs, the prevalence of state-related computer science policies, and how to continue to promote STEM identity growth.}

abstract = {Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations and experimental steady flow tests (flow discharge, swirl, and tumble) were carried out to study the in-cylinder flow in a commercial four-valve spark ignition engine. The present investigation was aimed at analysing and controlling the generation of macro-vortex structures (swirl and tumble) during the inlet process. A comparative study of the most commonly employed tumble benches along with in-house design was performed, the last showing some advantages with respect to the others. The outcomes from the simulations were in agreement with experimental results. Mainly, the tumble generation rate was in general proportional to the valve lift. However, tumble was reduced drastically at medium valve lift due to a change in the vortex pattern. A stagnation zone was observed between inlet valves. CFD calculations successfully captured this tumble-fall effect, which was related to characteristic changes in the vortex pattern downstream of the inlet valves at medium valve lift. This affects tumble production without affecting the mass flowrate efficiency. Finally, at high valve lifts the tumble production and the vortex pattern were recovered. The capability of the cylinder head to induce swirl, tumble, or combined swirl–tumble by modifying the valve timing or by introducing adjustable flow deflectors was evaluated using CFD. Several valve timing strategies were analysed: some of them produced significant swirl, but introduced high mass flowrate losses. On the other hand, adjustable flow deflectors were shown to be an interesting alternative to induce swirl–tumble at low load and to improve tumble at high load.}

abstract = {This article investigates the motivations of African American and Latino girls (N = 41) who navigate urban Southwest school districts during the day, but voluntarily attend a 2-year, culturally responsive multimedia program after school and into the summer. Understanding that girls from economically disadvantaged settings are indeed motivated to become technological innovators but often do not have access to the necessary resources to follow their interest, our program—entitled COMPUGIRLS—assumes a culturally responsive computing approach. This research examines particular features of the program (e.g., asset building, reflections, and connectedness) that attracted and retained the Latina (74%) and African American (19%) adolescent (ages 13-18) participants as well as to what extent the culturally relevant aspects of the curriculum assist with program retention and/or affect the students’ vision of themselves as a future technologist. An evaluative approach gathered 2 years of data from the participants. Field notes from observations and interviews were transcribed and reviewed to extract themes and areas of convergence. As a standpoint theory project, the authors center the girls’ voices as the primary data sources. Two primary themes emerged from the data to explain girls’ sustained motivation. The first was the challenge of learning and mastering the technology. For many, this also included disproving the stereotypes of their abilities by age, gender, and race. The second theme was being able to manipulate technology and learning experiences as a means of self-expression and research, particularly if the results could be used to inform their community and peers. The authors posit that much of the program impact was because of the culturally responsive practices (asset building, reflection, and connectedness) embedded within the curriculum. Implications for urban educators and program developers are considered.}

The evidence to answer these questions was derived from an analysis of quantitative and qualitative survey responses from 843 teacher educators from approximately half (n = 541) of the accredited teacher education programs in the country. The results showed that teacher educators are increasingly integrating technology across the curriculum, that there is a fairly low level of TPACK adoption, and that conceptions of TPACK vary greatly. The study helps to better understand these teacher educator practices in relationship to the literature on preparing teachers to use technology to support student learning.}

abstract = {The business model of architecture has been accused of being technologically deficient. Through case studies, this paper investigates alternatives to the status quo of computation in architecture, with a focus on design-oriented service providers. It first examines the discourse on computation within the field, then describes the experiments of a relevant design firm before discussing implications for the wider industry. In the process, the paper articulates the gap between theoretical computing applications and the realities of the architecture business. It addresses difficult technological adaptations within the industry with concrete use cases of integrated computing expertise, highlighting opportunities, benefits, and, more importantly, the need for a computational workforce.}

abstract = {Sixty-five Year 2 children with ages ranging from six to seven years participated in a teaching experiment to introduce functional thinking. The results show that young children are capable of generalising, can provide examples of relations and functions, can describe the inverse of such relationships and give valid reasons for how they found the inverse relationships. They also indicate that specific features of instruction assist this process, particularly abstracting underlying mathematical relationships, notably the materials used by the teacher and the children, the types of activities and the questions asked by the teacher. This leads to specific implications for the teaching of arithmetic in the early years.}
