abstract = {Many complex systems can be accurately modeled as a set of coupled time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). However, solving such equations can be prohibitively expensive, easily taxing the world’s largest supercomputers. One pragmatic strategy for attacking such problems is to split the PDEs into components that can more easily be solved in isolation. This operator splitting approach is used ubiquitously across scientific domains, and in many cases leads to a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that need to be solved as part of a larger “outer-loop” time-stepping approach. The SUNDIALS library provides a plethora of robust time integration algorithms for solving ODEs, and the U.S. Department of Energy Exascale Computing Project (ECP) has supported its extension to applications on exascale-capable computing hardware. In this paper, we highlight some SUNDIALS capabilities and its deployment in combustion and cosmology application codes (Pele and Nyx, respectively) where operator splitting gives rise to numerous, small ODE systems that must be solved concurrently.}

The introduction pursues a number of themes addressed in the section’s contributions, including pharmacological logic, transindividuation, computational practices, bifurcation and negentropy (means of slowing entropic processes at individual and collective levels). All of these themes pertain to the climate crises the world collectively faces and posit means by which futures can be conceived in less detrimental and destructive economic, social, technological and intellectual ways. The Internation Collective as represented and furthered in this special section responds to the demands of climate crises through a macroeconomic model designed to combat entropy at various scales, from the bio-chemical to the biosphere.}

abstract = {High-level motor computations reflect abstract components far apart from the mere motor performance. Neural correlates of these computations have been explored both in nonhuman and human primates, supporting the idea that our brain recruits complex nodes for motor representations. Of note, these computations have exciting implications for social cognition, and they also entail important challenges in the context of autism. Here, we focus on these challenges benefiting from recent studies addressing motor interference, motor resonance, and high-level motor planning. In addition, we suggest new ideas about how one maps and shares the (motor) space with others. Taken together, these issues inspire intriguing and fascinating questions about the social tendency of our high-level motor computations, and this tendency may indicate that we are “motorically” wired to others. Thus, after furnishing preliminary insights on putative neural nodes involved in these computations, we focus on how the hypothesized social nature of high-level motor computations may be anomalous or limited in autism, and why this represents a critical challenge for the future.}

Three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations with turbulence and combustion models are solved using commercial computational fluid dynamics software. Both infinitely fast kinetics and single-step finite rate H2–air kinetics are used to find out the effect of chemical kinetics in the thermochemical behaviour of the flow field. Grid independence of the results is demonstrated and gridconvergence index-based error estimate provided. k-ω turbulence model performs better, in comparison to k–ϵ and shear stress transport models, in predicting the surface pressure. Single-step finite rate chemistry (SSC) performs extremely well in predicting the flow features in the combustor. Computed temperature and species mole fraction and wall pressure distributions with SSC match better with the experimental results compared to fast chemistry calculation and detailed chemistry calculation of other workers. It has been observed that simple chemistry can describe H2–air reaction in scramjet combustor reasonably well.}

abstract = {Much research examines the state-dissident nexus by large-n studies and rational choice theories. This article contributes an analysis of dissident reasoning through a computational evaluation of ethnographic interviews. The analysis shows that dissident decision-making is based on tit-for-tat deliberations: Dissidents choose violent means primarily in response to violent repression, and nonviolent means in response to nonviolent repression. Ordinary citizens not participating in dissent consider positive state behavior or safety concerns instead. Consistent with arguments that state-dissident interactions are reciprocal, these findings reveal unexpected cognitive similarities between political dissent and cooperation, which is often associated with tit-for-tat deliberations. They also show the importance of state repression compared with other motivators of dissent, including perceived relative deprivation and social contagion. The findings identify heuristic patterns of reasoning which suggest that dissidents may be more open to change and, ultimately, cooperation with state authorities than what is argued by repressive states.}

abstract = {An internal circadian clock regulates the electrical activity of cardiac myocytes controlling the expression of potassium channel interacting protein–2 (KChIP2), which is a key regulator of cardiac electrical activity. Here, we examine how the circadian rhythm of KChIP2 expression affects the dynamics of human and murine ventricular action potentials (APs), as well as the intervals in the equivalent electrocardiograms (ECGs) reflecting the duration of depolarization and repolarization phases of the cardiac ventricular APs (QRS and QT intervals), with mathematical modeling. We show how the internal circadian clock can control the shape of APs and, in particular, predict AP, QRS, and QT interval prolongation following KChIP2 downregulation, as well as shortening of AP, QRS, and QT interval duration following KChIP2 upregulation. Based on the circadian expression of KChIP2, we can accurately predict the circadian rhythm in cardiac electrical activity and suggest the transient outward potassium currents as the key current for circadian rhythmicity. Our modeling work predicts a smaller effect of KChIP2 on AP and QT interval dynamics in humans. Taken together, these results support the role of KChIP2 as the key regulator of circadian rhythms in the electrical activity of the heart; we provide computational models that can be used to explore circadian rhythms in cardiac electrophysiology and susceptibility to arrhythmia.}

Here, an industrial complex cold box equipped with a number of plate-fins is simulated by computational fluid dynamics. The model predicts the outlet vapor fraction, pressure drop, and outlet temperature with average absolute relative deviations of 0.17%, 3.3%, and 12.89% for all streams, respectively. The influence of obstruction in streams B and C on the computational fluid dynamics results are studied. When stream B or C is blocked, the remaining open streams experience an increase in pressure drop, temperature, and vapor fraction, which negatively affects the heat exchanger’s performance over a long time. Finally, the computational fluid dynamics results of the cold box are compared with those of commercial software Aspen-EDR. Even though Aspen-EDR predicts an acceptable mean temperature and vapor fraction (phase change) along channels, it calculates pressure drop incorrectly. So, Aspen-EDR, computationally efficient software, can be used for modeling of mean temperature and phase change of flow in an industrial multi-stream cold box.}

The goal of the present work is to provide two novel and secure two-party distance computation protocols based on a semihonest model, the first with aid of a third party and the second based on randomization technique. Both of these protocols can extend the calculated value into a real number field. The output of the distance computation and the intermediate values in the proposed protocols are also private and not accessible to a third party or any other attackers. When executing these two protocols, security is guaranteed, and the performances of communication and computation of them are found to be satisfactory when compared to those of other similar protocols.}

abstract = {The growing availability of expansive social media trace data (SMTD) offers researchers promising opportunities to create rich depictions of societal and social phenomena. Despite this potential, research analysing such data often struggles to construct novel theoretical insight. This paper argues that holistically incorporating temporality enhances data collection and data analysis, subsequently facilitating process theory construction from SMTD. Recommendations to integrate temporality are outlined in the proposed Temporal Dynamics Framework and Methodology (TDFM). We apply the TDFM to investigate the temporal dynamics of mental health discourse on Twitter (now X) across different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, theoretically framed in the context of innate psychological needs satisfaction. The findings reveal dynamic shifts in social media use, indicating that different phases of the pandemic triggered changes in the needs motivating, and being motivated by, social media use. This illustrative case reflectively evaluates the TDFM’s usefulness in contextualising SMTD collection, analytical strategies, and process theory construction by incorporating a dynamic perspective on time.}

abstract = {Efficient exploitation of exascale architectures requires rethinking of the numerical algorithms used in many large-scale applications. These architectures favor algorithms that expose ultra fine-grain parallelism and maximize the ratio of floating point operations to energy intensive data movement. One of the few viable approaches to achieve high efficiency in the area of PDE discretizations on unstructured grids is to use matrix-free/partially assembled high-order finite element methods, since these methods can increase the accuracy and/or lower the computational time due to reduced data motion. In this paper we provide an overview of the research and development activities in the Center for Efficient Exascale Discretizations (CEED), a co-design center in the Exascale Computing Project that is focused on the development of next-generation discretization software and algorithms to enable a wide range of finite element applications to run efficiently on future hardware. CEED is a research partnership involving more than 30 computational scientists from two US national labs and five universities, including members of the Nek5000, MFEM, MAGMA and PETSc projects. We discuss the CEED co-design activities based on targeted benchmarks, miniapps and discretization libraries and our work on performance optimizations for large-scale GPU architectures. We also provide a broad overview of research and development activities in areas such as unstructured adaptive mesh refinement algorithms, matrix-free linear solvers, high-order data visualization, and list examples of collaborations with several ECP and external applications.}

abstract = {Over the past few years, we have seen the emergence of “big data”: disruptive technologies that have transformed commerce, science, and many aspects of society. Despite the tremendous enthusiasm for big data, there is no shortage of detractors. This article argues that many criticisms stem from a fundamental confusion over goals: whether the desired outcome of big data use is “better science” or “better engineering.” Critics point to the rejection of traditional data collection and analysis methods, confusion between correlation and causation, and an indifference to models with explanatory power. From the perspective of advancing social science, these are valid reservations. I contend, however, that if the end goal of big data use is to engineer computational artifacts that are more effective according to well-defined metrics, then whatever improves those metrics should be exploited without prejudice. Sound scientific reasoning, while helpful, is not necessary to improve engineering. Understanding the distinction between science and engineering resolves many of the apparent controversies surrounding big data and helps to clarify the criteria by which contributions should be assessed.}

These studies often result in large amounts of data produced and the objective is to generate meaningful interpretations from them. This can sometimes mean combining and integrating different datasets through data fusion techniques. The most strategic course of action when dealing with products of unknown profile is to use exploratory approaches. For omics, this means using untargeted analytical methods and exploratory data analysis techniques. The current study aimed to perform data fusion on untargeted multimodal (negative and positive mode) liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry data using multiple factor analysis. The data fusion results were interpreted using agglomerative hierarchical clustering on biplot projections. The study reduced the thousands of spectral signals processed to less than a hundred features (a primary parameter combination of retention time and mass-to-charge ratios, RT_m/z). The correlations between cluster members (samples and features from) were calculated and the top 10% highly correlated features were identified for each cluster. These features were then tentatively identified using secondary parameters (drift time, ion mobility constant and collision cross-section values) from the ion mobility spectra. These ion mobility (secondary) parameters can be used for future studies in wine chemical analysis and added to the growing list of annotated chemical signals in applied sciences.}

abstract = {Helicopters can experience brownout when flying close to a dusty surface. The uplifting of dust in the air can remarkably restrict the pilot’s visibility area. Consequently, a brownout can disorient the pilot and lead to the helicopter collision against the ground. Given its risks, brownout has become a high-priority problem for civil and military operations. Proper helicopter design is thus critical, as it has a strong influence over the shape and density of the cloud of dust that forms when brownout occurs. A way forward to improve aircraft design against brownout is the use of particle simulations. For simulations to be accurate and comparable to the real phenomenon, billions of particles are required. However, using a large number of particles, serial simulations can be slow and too computationally expensive to be performed. In this work, we investigate an message passing interface (MPI) + graphics processing unit (multi-GPU) approach to simulate brownout. In specific, we use a semi-implicit Euler method to consider the particle dynamics in a Lagrangian way, and we adopt a precomputed aerodynamic field. Here, we do not include particle–particle collisions in the model; this allows for independent trajectories and effective model parallelization. To support our methodology, we provide a speedup analysis of the parallelization concerning the serial and pure-MPI simulations. The results show (i) very high speedups of the MPI + multi-GPU implementation with respect to the serial and pure-MPI ones, (ii) excellent weak and strong scalability properties of the implemented time-integration algorithm, and (iii) the possibility to run realistic simulations of brownout with billions of particles at a relatively small computational cost. This work paves the way toward more realistic brownout simulations, and it highlights the potential of high-performance computing for aiding and advancing aircraft design for brownout mitigation.}

abstract = {Data collection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can become extremely expensive in terms of power consumption if all measurements have to be fetched. However, since multiple applications do not require data from all nodes but to compute a function over a smaller data set, much of the available data on the network can be considered irrelevant and not worthy of spending energy. In this context, in-network filtering schemes can be used to forward only relevant data towards a sink node for processing purposes. In this work, we propose and evaluate two schemes that can drive this filtering process. Both of them are based on the integration of metaheuristics and learning algorithms inspired by nature. In particular, we consider the computation of the maximum function as case study for these schemes. We investigate the trade-off between communications costs, which are directly associated with power consumption, and error costs due to fetching not all relevant data. We show by simulation that communication costs can be significantly reduced with respect to traditional schemes while keeping the computation error bounded.}

abstract = {Mental rotation concerns the cognitive processes that allow an agent mentally to rotate the image of an object in order to solve a given task, for example to say if two objects with different orientations are the same or different. Here we present a system-level bio-constrained model, developed within a neurorobotics framework, that provides an embodied account of mental rotation processes relying on neural mechanisms involving motor affordance encoding, motor simulation and the anticipation of the sensory consequences of actions (both visual and proprioceptive). This model and methodology are in agreement with the most recent theoretical and empirical research on mental rotation. The model was validated through experiments with a simulated humanoid robot (iCub) engaged in solving a classical mental rotation test. The results of the test show that the robot is able to solve the task and, in agreement with data from psychology experiments, exhibits response times linearly dependent on the angular disparity between the objects.

abstract = {We describe a scalable version of the FLO67 program written in the loop style that is characteristic of Fortran 77. This single scalable source program can be com piled and run on conventional scalar processors, vec tor computers, or massively parallel computers, with respectable performance on all platforms. Initial runs have been on the IBM RISC System/6000, the Sun SPARC, and the Connection Machine supercomputer. This article presents and discusses interesting frag ments of the program, focusing on issues of code scalability.}

abstract = {In order to perform increasingly complex underwater tasks, we have designed a hydraulic underwater non-spherical wrist manipulator with a binocular vision system and a six-dimensional force sensor mounted behind the end-effector, which can improve the path accuracy and automation capabilities of the system. The system lays a foundation for the high precision and autonomous deep-sea operation and can improve its intelligence level. In this paper, we focus on solving the singularity avoidance problem of the hydraulic underwater manipulator for accurate control, and propose a computationally efficient singularity avoidance method to improve the path accuracy of the manipulator with the non-spherical wrist. Firstly, the singular configurations of the manipulator are analyzed. Secondly, the Jacobian is decomposed into sub-block matrices to obtain the singular factors according to the singular configurations. Thirdly, the singularities are avoided by the approximate damped reciprocal method. Theoretical analysis shows that the computation costs of the proposed method are only one-third to one-half of that of the traditional methods. The simulation results prove that the proposed method can largely improve the path accuracy of the manipulator with less computation costs, which shows that our method would have a certain significance in improving the precision and real-time response of deep-sea operations.}

abstract = {With detailed chemical kinetics being employed in combustion simulations, its major computational challenge is the time-intensive nature of chemical kinetics integration due to the large number of chemical species and wide range of chemical timescales involved. In this work, an extended tabulated dynamic chemistry approach with dynamic pruning method is carried out to simulate complex spray combustion for non-premixed combustion process. The thought of extended tabulated dynamic chemistry approach with dynamic pruning is achieved by selecting the optimum acceleration method as well as its error tolerances at different combustion stages depending on combustion characteristics involving the low-temperature combustion. The present method is applied to realistically complex combustion systems involving spray flame of n-heptane fuel and non-premixed combustion engine. Computation efficiency of the proposed method is compared with the results using different accelerating methods, including dynamical adaptive chemistry, in situ adaptive tabulation, and coupled method of tabulated dynamical adaptive chemistry. The results show that transient computational cost will decrease for low-temperature combustion by reducing ambient oxygen concentration clearly in spray flame. Meanwhile, very low computational efficiency is presented once the autoignition occurs, especially at the initial oxygen concentration of 21%. Based on the feature, extended tabulated dynamic chemistry approach with dynamic pruning with different dynamic adaptive chemistry error tolerances is proposed to improve computational efficiency. Extended tabulated dynamic chemistry approach with dynamic pruning with larger error tolerance improves around two times for decreased amplitude of transient computational cost at high-temperature combustion stage, and at the same time, the computational accuracy is also improved by comparing the important intermediate species obtained by direct integration. For applications in diesel engine, the results show that extended tabulated dynamic chemistry approach with dynamic pruning can accurately capture the first-stage ignition feature that determines the high-temperature combustion stage. In addition, extended tabulated dynamic chemistry approach with dynamic pruning with the smaller in situ adaptive tabulation error tolerance of 0.001 only used at the high-temperature combustion stage significantly improves the performance on diesel engine simulation with a larger chemistry mechanism. The present method further significantly improves computational efficiency with an overall speedup factor of 10 with high-accuracy compared with result using direct integration.}
