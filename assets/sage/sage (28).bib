abstract = {In computational fluid dynamics models for hemodynamics applications, boundary conditions remain one of the major issues in obtaining accurate fluid flow predictions. For major cardiovascular models, the realistic boundary conditions are not available. In order to address this issue, the whole computational domain needs to be modeled, which is practically impossible. For simulating fully developed turbulent flows using the large eddy simulation and dynamic numerical solution methods, which are very popular in hemodynamics studies, periodic boundary conditions are suitable. This is mainly because the computational domain can be reduced considerably. In this study, a novel periodic boundary condition is proposed, which is based on mass flow condition. The proposed boundary condition is applied on a square duct for the sake of validation. The mass-based condition was shown to obtain the solution in 15% less time. As such, the mass-based condition has two decisive advantages: first, the solution for a given Reynolds number can be obtained in a single simulation because of the direct specification of the mass flow, and second, simulations can be made more quickly.}

abstract = {Some of the most influential theories in organizational sciences explicitly describe a dynamic, multilevel process. Yet the inherent complexity of such theories makes them difficult to test. These theories often describe multiple subprocesses that interact reciprocally over time at different levels of analysis and over different time scales. Computational (i.e., mathematical) modeling is increasingly advocated as a method for developing and testing theories of this type. In organizational sciences, however, efforts that have been made to test models empirically are often indirect. We argue that the full potential of computational modeling as a tool for testing dynamic, multilevel theory is yet to be realized. In this article, we demonstrate an approach to testing dynamic, multilevel theory using computational modeling. The approach uses simulations to generate model predictions and Bayesian parameter estimation to fit models to empirical data and facilitate model comparisons. This approach enables a direct integration between theory, model, and data that we believe enables a more rigorous test of theory.}

abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases persist as a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, despite significant advances in diagnostic and surgical approaches. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) represents a branch of fluid mechanics widely used in industrial engineering but is increasingly applied to the cardiovascular system. This review delves into the transformative potential for simulating cardiac surgery procedures and perfusion systems, providing an in-depth examination of the state-of-the-art in cardiovascular CFD modeling. The study first describes the rationale for CFD modeling and later focuses on the latest advances in heart valve surgery, transcatheter heart valve replacement, aortic aneurysms, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The review underscores the role of CFD in better understanding physiopathology and its clinical relevance, as well as the profound impact of hemodynamic stimuli on patient outcomes. By integrating computational methods with advanced imaging techniques, CFD establishes a quantitative framework for understanding the intricacies of the cardiac field, providing valuable insights into disease progression and treatment strategies. As technology advances, the evolving synergy between computational simulations and clinical interventions is poised to revolutionize cardiovascular care. This collaboration sets the stage for more personalized and effective therapeutic strategies. With its potential to enhance our understanding of cardiac pathologies, CFD stands as a promising tool for improving patient outcomes in the dynamic landscape of cardiovascular medicine.}

While declaring this pipeline, the government assumes the needs of the economy and young people’s needs are (or should be) synchronised. We challenge this assumption and the policy it sustains with data from questionnaires, workshops and interviews with 50 young people from communities in South Wales (including a former mining town and a deprived inner city area) about digital technology’s role in their everyday life. We use a new typography to compare the reality of their socially and economically structured lives to the governmental policy discourse that makes them responsible for their country’s future economic success. To explain these young people’s creative and transgressive use of technology, we also make an empirically grounded contribution to the ongoing theoretical debates about structure and agency.}

abstract = {Conflicts involving caste issues, mainly concerning the lowest caste rights, pervade modern Indian society. Caste affiliation, being rigorously enforced by the society, is an official contemporary reality. Although caste identity is a major social discrimination, it also serves as a necessary condition for affirmative action like reservation policy. In this article, we perform an original and rigorous analysis of the discourse involving the theme “caste” in India newspapers. To this purpose, we have implemented a computational analysis over a big dataset of the 2016 and 2017 editions of three major Indian newspapers to determine the most salient themes associated with “caste” in the news. We have used an original mix of state-of-the-art algorithms, including those based on statistical distributions and two-layer neural networks, to detect the relevant topics in the news and characterize their linguistic context. We concluded that there is an excessive association between lower castes, victimization, and social unrest in the news that does not adequately cover the reports on other aspects of their life and personal identity, thus reinforcing conflict, while attenuating the vocality and agency of a large section of the population. From our conclusion, we propose a positive discrimination policy in the newsroom.}

abstract = {a. In 1973, the Department of Defense (DoD) created the Office of Net Assessment (ONA) with a charter and unique approach to strategic analysis. This approach questioned the suitability of systems analysis to assess long-term, dynamic competition between complex military organizations, and turned to more qualitative methods as analytic alternatives. Developments in computing technology and modeling methods over the last two decades, most notably agent-based modeling (ABM), provide new opportunities to address the central analytic questions that motivated the original development of net assessment as a distinctive practice of strategic analysis. By employing ABM to simulate and analyze the behavior of strategic, adaptive, boundedly rational actors, which have previously frustrated mathematical analysis, a new generation of computational models can provide opportunities to add rigor to net assessment.}

abstract = {Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) operation for coronary artery disease with different types of grafts has a large clinical application world wide. Immediately after this operation patients are usually relieved of their chest pain and have improved cardiac function. However, after a while, these bypass grafts may fail due to for example, neointimal hyperplasia or thrombosis. One of the causes for this bypass graft failure is assumed to be the blood flow with low wall shear stress. The aim of this research is to estimate the wall shear stress in a graft and thus to locate areas were wall shear stress is low. This was done with the help of a blood flow computer model. Postoperative biplane angiograms of the graft were recorded, and from these the three-dimensional geometry of the graft was reconstructed and imported into the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program FLUENT. The stationary diastolic flow through the grafts was calculated, and the wall shear stress distribution was estimated. This procedure was carried out for one native vessel and two different types of bypass grafts. One bypass graft was a saphenous vein and the other one was a varicose saphenous vein encased in a fine, flexible metal mesh. The mesh was attached to give the graft a defined diameter. The computational results show that each graft has distinct areas of low wall shear stress. The graft with the metal mesh has an area of low wall shear stress (< 1 Pa, stationary flow), which is four times smaller than the respective areas in the other graft and in the native vessel. This is thought to be caused by the smaller and more uniform diameter of the metal mesh-reinforced graft.}

Even after controlling for political ideology—which has been the most significant explanatory factor in determining trust in science within a survey framework—we found those with concerns over boundary-crossing (i.e. concerns or perceptions that science overlaps with politics, the government, and funding) were less likely to trust science than their counterparts.}

abstract = {Aerodynamics research in cycling has underpinned innovative bicycle design, new refined riding positions and optimised rider apparel. There has been a rise in the level of aerodynamics research focused on cycling since the turn of the millennium, enabled by significant increases in computational power and the availability of software/hardware. However, cycling research has not yet fully embraced para-cycling, with limited studies conducted on the aerodynamic performance of hand-cyclists and other para-cyclists. Wind tunnel experiments and computational fluid dynamics simulations were conducted in this research for the analysis of hand-cycling aerodynamics, focused on competitive H1–H4 category hand-cyclists. A quarter-scale representative geometry of a hand-cyclist was used in high-speed wind tunnel experiments. The accuracy of the simulations performed with the three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations was found to be dependent on the turbulence model choice and near-wall grid resolution. Computational fluid dynamics simulations predicted the magnitude of the drag and lateral forces to an accuracy of 2.5% using the shear stress transport turbulence model. This study also presents the impact of wheel diameter and disc wheels on hand-cycling aerodynamics via computational fluid dynamics simulations, providing a deeper understanding of the aerodynamic characteristics unique to the hand-cycling discipline in the sport of competitive cycling. Drag reductions of up to 8.9% were found when utilising 20-inch diameter spoked wheels, opposed to the 26-inch wheels. Variations in wheel diameter between the front and rear wheels were found to have a significant impact on the CDA in part through altering the pitch angle of the hand-cycle.}

Despite recent gains in our understanding of drug-induced toxicity, however, it is urgent that the utility and limitations of our current predictive tools be determined in order to identify gaps in our understanding of mechanistic and chemical toxicology. Using recently published computational regression analyses of in vitro and in vivo toxicology data, it will be demonstrated that significant gaps remain in early safety screening paradigms. More strategic analyses of these data sets will allow for a better understanding of their domain of applicability and help identify those compounds that cause significant in vivo toxicity but which are currently mis-predicted by in silico and in vitro models. These ‘outliers’ and falsely predicted compounds are metaphorical lighthouses that shine light on existing toxicological knowledge gaps, and it is essential that these compounds are investigated if attrition is to be reduced significantly in the future. As such, the modern computational toxicologist is more productively engaged in understanding these gaps and driving investigative toxicology towards addressing them.}

These predispositions neglect architecture’s cultural and material dimensions, resulting in universalizing tectonics that erase nuances of place, culture, and expression in design. How may we celebrate local tectonic languages while also revisiting them through computer-based systems in architecture? The project examined here highlights novel possibilities for cultural expression and craftsmanship through computational design methods, retaining the expressive potential of a local craft while de-familiarizing its cultural context. I analyze how shape grammars and digital fabrication methods deployed in design, de-familiarizes the craft of wire-bending in costuming in the Trinidad Carnival. I present and apply new rules for the craft’s computational description based on material tests and an architectural application to expand discourses on critical regionalism. I adopt Tabbarah’s term “computational regionalism” to describe this process and elaborate it as a five-step sequence. Computational regionalism employs computational methods to translate local craft knowledge and tectonic languages into new interpretations and poetics of construction. Its process of creative de-familiarization raises critical questions about the local and the universal.}

For example, those with a more analytic thinking style are more skeptical about religious, paranormal, and conspiratorial concepts. In addition, analytic thinking relates to having less traditional moral values, making less emotional or disgust-based moral judgments, and being less cooperative and more rationally self-interested in social dilemmas. Analytic thinkers are even less likely to offload thinking to smartphone technology and may be more creative. Taken together, these results indicate that the propensity to think analytically has major consequences for individual psychology.}

abstract = {Computational Biology is a fast-growing field that is enriched by different data-driven methodological approaches and by findings and applications in a broad range of biological areas. Fundamental to these approaches are the mathematical and computational models used to describe the different states at microscopic (for example a biochemical reaction), mesoscopic (the signalling effects at tissue level), and macroscopic levels (physiological and pathological effects) of biological processes. In this paper we address the problem of combining two powerful classes of methodologies: Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) methods which are now producing a revolution in biotechnology and medicine, and Petri Nets (PNs) which allow system generalisation and are central to various mathematical treatments, for example Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) specification of the biosystem under study. While the former is limited to modelling metabolic networks, i.e. does not account for intermittent dynamical signalling events, the latter is hampered by the need for a large amount of metabolic data. A first result presented in this paper is the identification of three types of cross-talks between PNs and FBA methods and their dependencies on available data. We exemplify our insights with the analysis of a pancreatic cancer model. We discuss how our reasoning framework provides a biologically and mathematically grounded decision making setting for the integration of regulatory, signalling, and metabolic networks and greatly increases model interpretability and reusability. We discuss how the parameters of PN and FBA models can be tuned and combined together so to highlight the computational effort needed to perform this task. We conclude with speculations and suggestions on this new promising research direction.}

abstract = {Computational biology allows and encourages the application of many different parallelism-based technologies. This special issue brings together high-quality state-of-the-art contributions about parallelism-based technologies in computational biology, from different points of view or perspectives, that is, from diverse high-performance computing applications. The special issue collects considerably extended and improved versions of the best papers, accepted and presented in PBio 2015 (the Third International Workshop on Parallelism in Bioinformatics, and part of IEEE ISPA 2015). The domains and topics covered in these seven papers are timely and important, and the authors have done an excellent job of presenting the material.}

abstract = {Background: Although the abnormal depositions of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), converging evidence shows that the individual’s neurodegeneration trajectory is regulated by the brain’s capability to maintain normal cognition. Objective: The concept of cognitive reserve has been introduced into the field of neuroscience, acting as a moderating factor for explaining the paradoxical relationship between the burden of AD pathology and the clinical outcome. It is of high demand to quantify the degree of conceptual cognitive reserve on an individual basis. Methods: We propose a novel statistical model to quantify an individual’s cognitive reserve against neuropathological burdens, where the predictors include demographic data (such as age and gender), socioeconomic factors (such as education and occupation), cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and AD-related polygenetic risk score. We conceptualize cognitive reserve as a joint product of AD pathology and socioeconomic factors where their interaction manifests a significant role in counteracting the progression of AD in our statistical model. Results: We apply our statistical models to re-investigate the moderated neurodegeneration trajectory by considering cognitive reserve, where we have discovered that 1) high education individuals have significantly higher reserve against the neuropathology than the low education group; however, 2) the cognitive decline in the high education group is significantly faster than low education individuals after the level of pathological burden increases beyond the tipping point. Conclusion: We propose a computational proxy of cognitive reserve that can be used in clinical routine to assess the progression of AD.}

abstract = {How do children learn to read? How do deficits in various components of the reading network affect learning outcomes? How does remediating one or several components change reading performance? In this article, we summarize what is known about learning to read and how this can be formalized in a developmentally plausible computational model of reading acquisition. The model is used to understand normal and impaired reading development (dyslexia). In particular, we show that it is possible to simulate individual learning trajectories and intervention outcomes on the basis of three component skills: orthography, phonology, and vocabulary. We therefore advocate a multifactorial computational approach to understanding reading that has practical implications for dyslexia and intervention.}
