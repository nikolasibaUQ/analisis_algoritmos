abstract = {Cuttings transport from wellbore annulus to the surface via drilling fluids is one of the most important problems in gas and oil industries. In the present paper, the effects of viscoelastic property of drilling fluids on flow through wellbore annulus are studied numerically by use of computational fluid dynamics simulation in OpenFOAM software. This problem is simulated as the flow between two coaxial annulus cylinders and the inner cylinder is rotating through its axes. Here, the Giesekus model is used as the nonlinear constitutive equation. This model brings the nonlinear viscosity, normal stress differences, extensional viscosity and elastic property. The numerical solution is obtained using the second order finite volume method by considering PISO algorithm for pressure correction. The effect of elasticity, Reynolds number, Taylor number and mobility factor on the velocity and stress fields, pressure drop, and important coefficient of drilling mud flow is studied in detail. The results predicted that increasing elastic property of drilling mud lead to an initial sharp drop in the axial pressure gradient as well as Darcy-Weisbach friction coefficient. Increasing the Reynolds number at constant Taylor number, resulted an enhancing in the axial pressure drop of the fluid but Darcy-Weisbach friction coefficient mainly reduced.}

abstract = {The paper presents computational fluid dynamics-based numerical simulation of the through-thickness air permeability of woven structures, applying the theory of jet systems. The flow through the interstices between the warp and weft threads is modeled as an “in-corridor”-ordered jet system, formed by nine jets, issuing from nine pores of the woven structure. Fifteen cases were simulated and three different turbulence models were applied in the simulation: k-ɛ, k-ω and Reynolds stress model. The five simulated woven structures were manufactured and their air permeability was measured experimentally. The performed validation of the numerical results with the experimental values of the air permeability showed very good correlation with the experimental results. The analysis and the verification showed that the method can be applied for further investigation not only of the woven fabrics’ air permeability, but also for investigation of the flow after a textile barrier of a woven type.}

abstract = {Abstract A computational study has been conducted to analyse the performance of a centrifugal compressor with different types of diffusers under various levels of impeller—diffuser interactions. Vaneless (VLD), vaned (VD), low solidity vaned (LSVD), and partial vaned diffusers (PVD) are used for this purpose. The study is carried out using commercial software ANSYS CFX. The interaction level is varied by varying the radial gap between the impeller and diffuser by keeping the diffuser vane at three different radial locations. Numerical simulations have been conducted for four different flow coefficients. At design flow coefficient maximum efficiency occurs when the leading edge is at R3 (ratio of radius of the diffuser leading edge to the impeller tip radius) = 1.10 for all vane-type diffuser configurations. At below design flow coefficient higher stage efficiency occurs when the diffuser vanes are kept far away (R3 = 1.15) and at above design flow coefficient R3 = 1.05 gives better efficiency. The highest diffuser pressure recovery coefficient (Cp) is observed for VD at design flow coefficient. For VLD, the Cp value increases with flow coefficient. In the case of VD and LSVD configurations the exit flow from the impeller is disturbed when the diffuser vanes are closer, and these disturbances are more evident in the last 10 per cent of the impeller flow. In the case of the impeller with PVD the interaction effects are minimum.}

The analysis consists of experimental tests and CFD simulations, performed in both wind tunnel and on-track scenarios. A method for the computation of the aerodynamic uplift and for the assessment of the contact force imbalance between the leading and trailing collectors is proposed. The method is based on the virtual work principle, and exploits both the numerical forces resulting from CFD analysis, and the Jacobian terms obtained from a kinematic analysis of the pantograph. The proposed model takes into account stationary phenomena, and it is fully validated by means of experimental results.}

abstract = {Although in the ionizing radiation field many concepts and processes are currently recognized as radiobiological, there are also probabilistic ones, and a probabilistic treatment makes a better understanding about them. The purpose of this study is to develop a new radiobiological simulator that calculates the tumor control probability (TCP) for a tumor heterogeneously irradiated from a fractioned treatment. The three possible types of cells and the results of interactions of ionizing radiation with each cell of a determined volume are analyzed. For an irradiated region with a dose per fraction d, the simulator determines the radiation biological effects using the cell kill (K) and cell sub-lethal damage, volume, cell density, cell repair of damaged cells during the interfractions, and number of fractions. K is determined from its probabilistic complement, the cell survival (S), described with the linear-quadratic (LQ) S(d) model as K = 1 −LQ S(d). TCP is calculated from computational simulations as in the ratio of simulations with K = 100% and their total. This application opens new avenues for theoretical and experimental investigations concerning simulations of radiation treatments, and methodologies for therapy optimizations. Our simulator represents a novel methodology as TCP is calculated without analytical formulas, but based on its own probabilistic definition.}

abstract = {There is a growing interest in organic Rankine cycle turbogenerators because of their ability to efficiently utilize external heat sources at low-to-medium temperature in the small-to-medium power range. High-temperature organic Rankine cycle turbines typically operate at very high pressure ratio and expand the organic working fluid in the dense-vapour thermodynamic region, thus requiring computational fluid dynamics solvers coupled with accurate thermodynamic models for their performance assessment and design. In this article we present a steady-state three-dimensional viscous computational fluid dynamics study of the Tri-O-Gen organic Rankine cycle radial turbine, including the radial nozzle, the rotor and the diffuser. The turbine operates with toluene as the working fluid, whose accurate thermophysical properties are obtained with a look-up table approach. Based on the three-dimensional simulation results, together with a two-dimensional fluid dynamic optimisation procedure documented elsewhere, an improved nozzle geometry is designed, manufactured and experimentally tested. Measurements show it delivers 5 kWe or 4% more net power output, as well as improved off-design performance.}

Other variables included SAT–I Verbal and Mathematics scores and self-rated mathematics ability. Participants were 65 college students. There was no significant relationship between the tolerance variable and computational estimation performance. There was a modest negative relationship between Agreeableness and estimation performance.

The paper also investigates, by means of computational fluid dynamics, the pressure drop occurring in the pump chamber during the first part of the inlet stroke in order to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to cavitation. The model includes the compressibility of the working fluid and the lift of the inlet valve as a function of the pressure field on the inlet valve surfaces. It also takes into account the valve spring preload in the overall balance of forces moving the valve. Simulation of the valve motion was achieved by providing the solver with two user-defined functions. The plunger lift–time history was defined by the crank diameter and connecting rod length.

Therefore, the flow uniformity of the overhead ventilation duct system is very important for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning performance of a train. In this study, design optimization was conducted to increase the flow uniformity of the overhead ventilation duct system for a train by combining computational fluid dynamics and design of experiment methods. To perform the study, the flow uniformity of the base model was evaluated using numerical analysis whose reliability was verified. Design parameters of the overhead ventilation duct system were selected, and an effectiveness evaluation was performed for each design parameter by using 2k factorial design. Based on the results of the effectiveness evaluation for the design parameters, optimum models having improved flow uniformity were designed using the response surface method. The performances of the optimum models were also evaluated by the same numerical analysis that was applied to the base model. The flow uniformity of the optimum models was improved by controlling the opening ratios of the perforated plates and guide vane shape. In addition, nonuniform flow components locally existing in the base model were suppressed.}

abstract = {The heat pipes in solar applications uses are important and it is significantly growing nowadays. Capable of meeting the world’s challenges with a threat to the climate; a shortage of conventional energy sources, usually fossil fuels, high electricity costs, and it is inexpensive; therefore, the renewable energy of solar energy is an excellent source, reaching total amount of energy is 34,00,000 EJ in each year, all over the world. This is between 7000 and 8000 times the annual global primary energy consumption. Thereby, a Concentrating Solar Parabolic Trough Collector is suggested in this paper, which can be used to analyze the performance of various heat pipes. Using solar parabolic trough collector to analyze the performance of different heat pipes rather than considering the supply of electric power input. Using a parabolic trough collector that concentrates solar energy on an evacuated tube heat pipe, which converts radiation energy into electrical energy heat, the experimental work demonstrates the use of solar energy. Condensers, evaporators, and three heat pipes consisting of aluminum galvanized iron, and stainless steel materials are the main components. A porous wick structure and an ammonia solution-filled working fluid consist of each heat pipe. Continuously recirculating the working fluid through temperature variation. The readings are taken using connected thermocouples on three heat pipes by continuously varying the mass flow rate. The vacuum pressure gauge to maintain the heat pipes generates the vacuum inside space. At various mass flow rates of heated water from the parabolic trough collector, experimentation was also performed. The result of this study calculates the mass flow rate at the end of the process of the different heat pipes used here. Furthermore, different inclinations are estimated in a variety of situations, such as at temperatures of 15°, 30°, 45°, and 60°. In the experimental analysis, outlet temperatures of heat pipes are measured and the temperature distribution contours are evaluated using the analysis of computational fluid dynamics.}

abstract = {Computational cognitive models typically focus on individual behavior in isolation. Models frequently employ closed-form solutions in which a state of the system can be computed if all parameters and functions are known. However, closed-form models are challenged when used to predict behaviors for dynamic, adaptive, and heterogeneous agents. Such systems are complex and typically cannot be predicted or explained by analytical solutions without application of significant simplifications. In addressing this problem, cognitive and social psychological sciences may profitably use agent-based models, which are widely employed to simulate complex systems. We show that these models can be used to explore how cognitive models scale in social networks to calibrate model parameters, to validate model predictions, and to engender model development. Agent-based models allow for controlled experiments of complex systems and can explore how changes in low-level parameters impact the behavior at a whole-system level. They can test predictions of cognitive models and may function as a bridge between individually and socially oriented models.}

The flow field through the impeller was analysed to investigate the effect of blade twists and to determine the forces on the blades. A modified impeller design is suggested whose diameter is less than the existing one, which helps in reducing the centrifugal forces. The flow field analysis of the modified impeller shows improvement in the flow through the impeller channels with better performance and reduction in forces on the blades.}

Here the goal is to go beyond a mapping of the main meaning of a text to mimic the kinds of questions and concerns that have traditionally been the focus of a hermeneutically grounded close reading, a reading that focuses on what Kenneth Burke described as the poetic meanings of a text.

abstract = {The establishment of a healthy indoor environment requires the accurate evaluation of an individual’s exposure to pollutants. The concentration of indoor chemical pollutants is a representative indicator for such evaluation and is generally measured on-site. Moreover, material flow analysis (MFA), using macroscopic statistical data, is a reasonable method for objectively evaluating pollution on a wide scale; however, no effective strategy exists for the prediction of indoor air pollution, nor for the assessment of an individual’s exposure from social stock data. Accordingly, we developed a novel integration method comprising MFA and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with a computer-simulated person (CSP) to establish a framework for evaluating indoor pollutant concentration and individual exposure of residents. We focused on diethyl-hexyl phthalate (DEHP) and first estimated the amount of DEHP-containing product accumulation in Japan by MFA. Second, we conducted a thorough survey and measurement of DEHP emission rates. Using these results as boundary conditions for indoor CFD with CSP, the individual exposure of a resident, in a standard residential house, was quantitatively evaluated. The total daily exposure per unit of body weight was estimated to be more than 100 (μg/kg/d) in the worst-case scenario which was considered the upper limit for exposure in this analysis.}

abstract = {Objective. Sinus ventilation is often associated with sinusitis, a common condition causing significant pain and reduced quality of life. Clinical implications of the diverse anatomy of ostia connecting sinus to nose and the efficacy of surgical intervention in chronic sinusitis are poorly understood. This study aimed to measure sinus ventilation and explore variables in physical and mathematical models. Study Design. γ-Scintigraphy of krypton 81m (81mKr) was carried out in a stylized physical model of a human maxillary sinus. Computational simulations matched this model for validation and extrapolated to combinations of variables not possible experimentally for evaluation of transport mechanisms. Setting. Research laboratory in Department of Aeronautics. Imperial College London, and Department of Nuclear Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London. Methods. 81mKr distribution was measured with both single- and double-ostia sinuses. Computational simulations matched and extended the physical measurements and enabled separate identification and evaluation of transport mechanisms. Results. The presence of an additional ostium resulted in a 50-fold increase in the effective volume flow rate of gas replacement in the sinus. In the case of a single ostium, doubling the ostial diameter doubled the effective volume flow rate of gas exchange. Conclusion. γ-Scintigraphy of 81mKr enables quantitative assessment of effective volume flow rate in physical model sinuses. These flow rates obtained experimentally for single- and double-ostium sinuses match the computational predictions of matching geometries. The increased ventilation seen with an additional ostium or increased ostial diameters may not be clinically beneficial, because it could reduce nitric oxide concentration in the sinus.}

abstract = {In this work, the authors present a two-dimensional computational model for predicting the aeroelastic response as well as the output power of vertically arranged harvesters by taking into account all aerodynamic interactions. The piezo-aeroelastic framework consists of the following: (1) an aerodynamic model based on the unsteady vortex-lattice method to compute the aerodynamic forces; (2) a discrete parameter model for each harvester with 3 degrees of freedom (plunge motion, pitch motion, and the voltage generated by the piezoelectric effect); (3) an inter-model connection to exchange information between models at each time step; and (4) a numerical scheme based on the Hamming’s fourth-order predictor–corrector method to integrate all the governing equations in the time domain. The results obtained allow us to infer new insights into the flutter onset as well as the post-critical behavior of harvester arrangements. An interesting finding is that the flutter speed is significantly decreased as the distance between the harvesters is reduced. The results suggest the strong possibility of effective energy extraction at low flow speeds using properly distributed harvester arrangements. However, in post-critical conditions, the output power is significantly enhanced as the free-stream speed is increased.}

abstract = {Study Design Mechanical simulations. Objective Inadequate calibration of annuli negatively affects the computational accuracy of finite element (FE) models. Specifically, the definition of annulus average radius (AR) does not have uniformity standards. Differences between the elastic moduli in the different layers and parts of the annulus were not fully calibrated when a linear elastic material is used to define its material properties. This study aims to optimize the computational accuracy of the FE model by calibrating the annulus. Methods We calibrated the annulus AR and elastic modulus in our anterior-constructed lumbar model by eliminating the difference between the computed range of motion and that measured by in vitro studies under a flexion-extension loading condition. Multi-indicator validation was performed by comparing the computed indicators with those measured in in vitro studies. The computation time required for the different models has also been recorded to evaluate the computational efficiency. Results The difference between computed and measured ROMs was less than 1% when the annulus AR and elastic modulus were calibrated. In the model validation process, all the indicators computed by the calibrated FE model were within ±1 standard deviation of the average values obtained from in vitro studies. The maximum difference between the computed and measured values was less than 10% under nearly all loading conditions. There is no apparent variation tendency for the computational time associated with different models. Conclusion The FE model with calibrated annulus AR and regional elastic modulus has higher computational accuracy and can be used in subsequent mechanical studies.}
