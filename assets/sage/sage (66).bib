abstract = {Minimum miscibility pressure is the least required pressure for complete mixing of gas and oil in the reservoir conditions. It is an important parameter in the processes of gas injection in a miscible manner and its precise determination is very vital in choosing the type of injecting gas and planning injecting equipment for increasing the recovery efficiency. The common method is determining MMP in slim tube or 1-D simulation of slim tube. Usually determining the minimum miscibility pressure via slim tube apparatus is an expensive and time-consuming test and to carry it out it is necessary to have a sample of reservoir oil and suggested injecting gas. Occasionally it is possible that for some unknown reasons despite spending much time and money it won’t bring up any result. As a result, for determining this parameter, finding another method which has a higher precision in addition to being swift and less expensive is very necessary. On the other hand, there are several simulation methods to determine minimum miscibility pressure. These methods are so fast rather than slim tube experiment and relatively precise. MMP can be estimated numerically using compositional simulation, method of characteristics (MOC), mixing-cell methods, intelligent methods, and empirical correlations. However, nowadays one dimensional (1-D) slim tube simulation based on compositional simulation is very common. In this paper a suggestive method is proposed for determining MMP. A mixing rule method coupled with artificial neural network model (ANN) based on a numerous experiment data. Accuracy and computational time of artificial neural network method were compared to common prior models and correlations. The results show although intelligent methods are so fast, 1-D slim tube simulation is still a proper method to determine MMP in high accuracy. Average absolute relative error for MMP value is 1.5% for 1-D slim tube simulation, while the number for ANN is 3.25%. However, ANN method is recommended for fast MMP estimation.}

abstract = {Intelligent driving has been benefiting from advances in automotive big data analysis and on-demand data communications, where efficient vehicle-to-cloud communication is a key technology able to collect a huge amount of data from vehicles. However, as the capacities of the network and computational resources of the cloud are not unlimited, simultaneous data transfer based on a best-effort manner results in a resource starvation problem. Therefore, an application is needed to prioritize data communication to alleviate the problem and complete the data transfer just in time. This paper highlights the problem of resource starvation led by best-effort data transfers. It proposes protocols for data communication and control that could enable just-in-time data communication, notably for data collection. We demonstrate through experiments that the proposed mechanism enables efficient and effective data collection over the shared network resources.}

abstract = {The ability to acquire a representation of the spatial environment and the ability to localize within it are essential for successful navigation in a-priori unknown environments. The hippocampal forma tion is believed to play a key role in spatial learning and localization in animals in general and rodents in particular. This paper briefly reviews the relevant neurobiological and cognitive data, and their relation to computational models of spatial learning and localization used in contempo rary mobile robots. It proposes a hippocampal model of spatial learning and localization, and characterizes it using a Kalman filter based tool for information fusion from multiple uncertain sources. The resulting model not only explains neurobiological and behavioral data from rodent experiments, but also allows a robot to learn a place-based metric representation of space and to localize itself in a stochastically optimal manner. The paper presents an algorithmic implementa tion of the model and results of several experiments that demonstrate its capabilities. These include the ability to disambiguate perceptually similar places, scale well with increasing errors, and the automatic acquisition of spatial information at multiple resolutions.}

abstract = {The main aim of the work was to investigate a simplified finite element simulation of the out-of-plane distortion caused by fusion butt welding. The thermal transient part of the simulation made use of a finite element analysis of the two-dimensional cross-section of the weld joint and the thermoelastic-plastic treatment was based on analytical algorithms describing transverse and longitudinal deformations, leading to predictions of transverse angular deformation and longitudinal contraction force. These results were then applied to a non-linear elastic finite element model to provide predictions of the final angular and overall deformations of the butt-welded plates. The validity of the simulation was investigated via full-scale tests on 4m x 1.4m x 5 mm steel plates, butt welded using a flux-cored Ar-CO2 metal-inert gas process. Thermography and thermocouple arrays were used to validate the thermal transient computations and out-of-plane deformations were measured using displacement transducers for transient deformations and a laser scanning system to measure the profiles of the whole plates before and after welding. The results of six full-scale tests are given and comparison with the simulations shows that the procedure provides good prediction of the angular and overall out-of-plane deformations. Prediction accuracy requires account to be taken of initial shape, gravity loading, and support conditions.}

abstract = {Learning programming is a painful process for most students, especially those learning text- based programming languages. In this study, based on the principle of Bandura’s social learning theory, the vicarious real-life experiences of several pioneers in the field of IT and programming were presented as 15-minutes stories to a group of 9th graders learning to code in Python. A quasi-experimental research design was used to examine the effects of the theory and associated technique on student achievement. The 27 participants in the experiment group watched these presentations before engaging in programming activities while a control group were also observed who received no extra motivational intervention. Those in the experiment group were found to have significantly improved their programming achievement compared to those in the control group. Additionally, the functionality and originality of the experimental group projects were significantly better than those produced in the control group. They reported that they had been motivated by the pioneer stories, and their interest and self-efficacy beliefs in relation to creating high level programming projects were increased. The results highlight the benefits obtained from proper application of a “pioneer-story technique” to improve text-based programming skills.}

The fluid is modelled conventionally as an ideal Bingham plastic to verify the subsequent use of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package for similar flows in more complex situations but with a futuristic view to including heat transfer, electrical conductance, thermal and shear rate effects on fluid properties, and unsteady motion. The CFD (Fluent) package incorporates a user-defined subroutine facility which allows non-Newtonian constitutive models to be incorporated. Both radial and concentric geometries are considered. The two approaches (conventional analysis and CFD) are seen to complement one another.}

To guarantee a successful educational innovation, schools seek out different parties for valuable opinions. Among them, parents are the important feedback providers, because their attitudes are influential on children’s academic performance. Moreover, their involvement and support are considered the key factor that facilitates an effective implementation of programming education at schools. This study aimed at developing and validating an instrument measuring parents’ perceptions of programming education among P-12 schools in Hong Kong. We propose that parents’ perceptions of programming education is a multidimensional construct which constitutes (a) understanding, (b) support, and (c) expectation. In total, 524 questionnaires were collected from the parents who attended programming workshops and seminars. Exploratory factor analysis shows evidence for the three-dimensional construct. Confirmatory factor analysis reconfirms the measurement structure. Implications of the study are discussed.}

abstract = {Stroke-related numbness and weakness (SRNW) are resultant symptoms of post-stroke sufferers. Existing research has supported the use of Huangqi Guizhi Wuwu Tang (HGWT) particularly for SRNW; however, their mechanisms of action have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of action of HGWT components targeting SRNW-related proteins through a computational molecular docking approach. Target proteins associated with SRNW were identified through DrugBank database and Open Targets database. Chemical compounds from each herb of HGWT were identified from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology and Analysis Platform (TCMSP). Autodock Vina was utilized and the cut-off criterion applied for protein-ligand complexes was a binding affinity score of ≤ -9.5 kcal/mol; selected protein-ligand complexes were identified using 3D and 2D structural analyses. The protein targets PDE5A and ESR1 have highlighted interactions with compounds (BS040, DZ006, DZ058, DZ118, and HQ066) which are the key molecules in the management of SRNW. PDE5A have bioactivity with the amino acid residues (Val230, Asn252, Gln133 and Thr166) throughout PDE5A-cGMP-PKG pathways which involved reduction in myofilament responsiveness. ESR1 were predicted to be critical active with site residue (Leu346, Glu419 and Leu387) and its proteoglycans pathway involving CD44v3/CD44 that activates rho-associated protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) and ankyrin increasing vascular smooth muscle. In conclusion, HGWT may provide therapeutic benefits through strong interactions between herbal compounds and target proteins of PDE5A and ESR1. Further experimental studies are needed to unequivocally support this result which can be valuable to increase the quality of life of post-stroke patients.

The use of computational and experimental approaches greatly enhanced the understanding of how the actuators worked as well enabled the program to be completed for a lower cost than if either the modelling or the experiments had been neglected. Wind tunnel experiments were used with computational fluid dynamics results to provide aerodynamic coefficients for six-degree of freedom (6-DOF) simulations. The 6-DOF simulations were used to predict the performance of the projectile in the range, thus ensuring that good range data were acquired and reducing the necessary number of set-up rounds. It was found that there were cases where experimental methods were necessary, although the modelling provided the researchers with a greater detail of flow interactions and provided forces that were difficult to measure.}

abstract = {A computational model to design plastic food packaging is proposed. The model minimizes the cost of the multi-layer structure satisfying the specific product requirements, using a heuristic optimization algorithm. The product requirements are defined by the expected shelf life, the storage conditions, the water sorption isotherms of foods and the maximum allowable gain or loss of gases (O2, CO2, N2, etc.) and moisture for the packaged food. In order to assure the food shelf life, these product requirements should be fulfilled to estimate the maximum permeance values of the plastic package. The computational algorithm automatically generates different multi-layer film structures that satisfy the product requirements. This algorithm combines different polymeric materials taking into account the barrier properties and cost of each layer, the compatibility between layers, the maximum number of layers and the minimum and maximum film thickness for each layer. Temperature and relative humidity corrections for the permeance calculations are considered. Permeance calculations of several barrier films are compared with oxygen transmission rate (OTR) and water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) measurements. The optimization model algorithm is evaluated by means of standard numerical routines and numerical benchmarking.}

In this paper, numerical studies are done to investigate the supersonic combustion of hydrogen and air co-flow in presence of the ramp edge. In this study, flame maintenance and combustion formation in a dual-combustion ramjet engine are fully investigated. The primary emphasis of this work is to disclose the impact of produced shocks due to the existence of ramp edge on the structure of fuel and air-jet immediately downstream of injector. The shock interactions of two different angles (10 deg and 30 deg) of the ramp edge are investigated. Favre-averaged conservation equations are considered for the simulation of compressible flows inside the combustor. Various mechanisms expressing the flame spreading characteristics are also examined. Depending on the angle of the ramp edge, the produced shock waves influence on size and strength of vortices. Our findings also show that high angles of ramp edge augment the fluctuation of the vortices by the splitter and consequently, fuel mixing enhances in the combustion chamber of ramjet engine. Our findings also confirm that the similar jet pressure would be more effective on the vortex production downstream of the splitter. The application of ramp edge with angle of 30 deg would increase average momentum thickness of the mixing layer up to 55%.}

abstract = {The process of coating textiles with a blade coater has been investigated with CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) software. The simulations have uncovered a pressure drop in the area between the edge of the knife and the textile. This drop can be explained by the varying height of the flow channel which is made of the knife and the textile in conjunction with the no slip condition that is applied to the walls. In the simulations this drop became arbitrarily deep with increasing viscosity leading to negative absolute pressure levels. This may be a hint that the no slip condition is not valid in this scenario that involves shear rates of the order of 103/s and dynamic viscosities of around 10 to 100Pas. With a proposed slip condition for the textile the pressure drop became less pronounced. At the same time the flow rate through the gap between knife and textile was reduced leading to a thinner coating. This can be a hint that a slip between coating material and textile can cause distortions in the coating up to a complete disruption which is reported frequently by the industry. This could eventually be avoided by reducing the varying height of the flow channel. Alternatively a vertical lift of the textile due to the negative pressure was taken into account. This lift appeared only with low tensions of the textile of about 1N/m and showed no influence on coating thickness and pressure drop.}

In contrast, simulators for more general formalisms, such as Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS), need to support a wider set of models. Their inability to use domain information prevents DEVS simulators from achieving as high performance as their domain-specific variants. To solve this problem, we introduce a way to enhance the simulation performance of DEVS models through the use of computational resource usage models, often termed “activity” models. These models augment general-purpose DEVS models with domain-specific information, which can be used by the simulator. We apply this information in the context of data structure optimization, load balancing, and model allocation. Activity-awareness is a non-invasive extension to the DEVS formalism, meaning that activity-augmented models remain perfectly valid for use in activity-unaware simulators. Similarly, models without activity can still be simulated by an activity-aware simulator. Our approach is validated by making PythonPDEVS, a Parallel DEVS simulator, activity-aware and evaluating the performance impact on a set of benchmark models.}

abstract = {This article presents the results from exploring the impact of using a parametric design tool on designers’ behavior in terms of using design patterns in the early conceptual development stage of designing. It is based on an empirical cognitive study in which eight architectural designers were asked to complete two architectural design tasks with similar complexity, respectively, in a parametric design environment and a geometric modeling environment. The protocol analysis method was employed to study the designers’ behavior. In order to explore the development of design patterns in the empirical data, Markov model analysis is utilized. Through Markov models analysis of the parametric design environment and geometric modeling environment results, it was found that there are some significantly different design patterns being used when designing in a parametric design environment compared to designing in a geometric modeling environment. The article articulates these differences and draws conclusions from these results.}

abstract = {The three-dimensional time-domain computational fluid dynamics approach is employed to calculate and analyze the sound attenuation behavior of water-filled perforated pipe silencers. Transmission loss predictions from the time-domain computational fluid dynamics approach and the frequency-domain finite element method agree well with each other for the straight-through and cross-flow perforated pipe silencers without flow. Then, the time-domain computational fluid dynamics approach is used to investigate the effects of flow velocity, diameter, and porosity of orifices on the sound attenuation behavior of the silencers. The numerical predictions demonstrate that the flow increases the transmission loss, especially at high frequencies. Based on the above analysis, partially plugged straight-through perforated pipe silencer is proposed to improve the sound attenuation performance by increasing the flow velocity through the orifices. In order to eliminate the pass frequency of the perforated pipe silencers and improve the sound attenuation performance in mid- to high-frequency range, a folded straight-through perforated pipe silencer is designed and its sound attenuation behavior is analyzed numerically using the time-domain computational fluid dynamics approach.}
