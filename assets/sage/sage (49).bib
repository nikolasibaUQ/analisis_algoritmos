abstract = {The efficient global optimization method is a global optimization technique that can select the next sample point automatically by infill sampling criteria and search for the global minimum with less samples than the conventional global optimization needs. Infill sampling criteria function consists of the predictor and mean square error provided from the kriging model, which is a stochastic metamodel. Also, the constrained efficient global optimization method can minimize the objective function when dealing with constraints under the efficient global optimization concept. In this study, the constrained efficient global optimization method was applied to the RAE2822 airfoil shape design formulated with constraint. But the noisy computational fluid dynamics data caused the kriging model to fail to depict the true function. The distorted kriging model would make the efficient global optimization deviate from the correct search. This distortion of kriging model can be handled with the interpolation (p = free) kriging model. With the interpolation (p = free) kriging model, however, the search for efficient global optimization solution was stalled in a narrow feasible region, so there were less chances to update the objective and constraint functions. Then the accuracy of the efficient global optimization solution may not be good enough, so the three-step search method is proposed to obtain an accurate global minimum as well as prevent the distortion of kriging model for the noisy constrained computational fluid dynamics problem.}

abstract = {Hospitals are plagued with a multitude of logistical challenges amplified by a time-sensitive and high intensity environment. These conditions have resulted in burnout among both doctors and nurses as they work tirelessly to provide critical care to patients in need. We propose a new machine-learning-powered matching mechanism that manages the surgeon-nurse-patient assignment process in an efficient way that saves time and energy for hospitals, enabling them to focus almost entirely on delivering effective care. Through this design, we show how incorporating artificial intelligence into management systems enables teams of all sizes to meaningfully coordinate in highly chaotic and complex environments.}

abstract = {Bruner, Goodnow, and Austin’s (1956) research on concept development is re-examined from a connectionist perspective. A neural network was constructed which associates positive and negative instances of a concept with their corresponding attribute values. Two methods were used to help preserve the ecological validity of the input: 1) closely mapping the input to the actual visual stimuli; and 2) structuring the output layer based on Gagne’s (1962, 1985) work on human concept learning. This resulted in the addition of output units referred to as attribute context constraints. These units required the network to demonstrate the identification of attributes both relevant and irrelevant to the task of classification. Results suggest that the simultaneous learning of attributes guided the network in constructing a faster and more generalizable representation than when attribute constraints were absent. Results are discussed with respect to the advantages of computational approaches to studying learning.}

abstract = {A novel high-order three-scale (HOTS) computational method for elastic behavior analysis and strength prediction of axisymmetric composite structures with multiple spatial scales is developed in this paper. The multiple heterogeneities of axisymmetric composite structures we investigated are taken into account by periodic distributions of representative unit cells on the mesoscale and microscale. First, the new micro–meso–macro coupled HOTS computational model for elastic problems of axisymmetric composite structures is established based on multiscale asymptotic analysis, which breaks through the traditional multiscale assumptions and includes three main components. Two classes of mesoscopic and microscopic auxiliary cell functions are constructed on the mesoscale and microscale, respectively. The macroscopic homogenization problems are defined on global axisymmetric structures by twice up-scaling procedures from microscale to mesoscale and then from mesoscale to macroscale. Moreover, the asymptotic HOTS solutions are constructed for approximating multiscale elastic problems of axisymmetric structures and the numerical accuracy analysis of the HOTS solutions is given in detail. Then, the strength prediction formulas for axisymmetric composite structures with multiple spatial scales are presented based on the high-accuracy elastic behavior analysis from the proposed HOTS computational model. Furthermore, the corresponding HOTS numerical algorithm based on the finite element method (FEM) is presented for analyzing the mechanical behaviors and predicting the strength of axisymmetric composite structures with multiple spatial scales in detail. Finally, some numerical examples are reported to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed HOTS computational method. In this study, a unified three-scale computational framework is offered, which enables the simulation of mechanical behaviors of axisymmetric composite structures with multiple spatial scales.}

We prove that (a slight restriction of) AP is in NC1 in dimension one, leaving the general case open. Moreover, we prove that AP is P-complete in dimension two. The proof of this latter result is based on a reduction from the monotone circuit value problem by building logic gates and wires which work with an initial sand distribution in KSPM. These results are also related to the known prediction problem for sandpiles which is in NC1 for one-dimensional sandpiles and P-complete for dimension 3 or higher. The computational complexity of the prediction problem remains open for the Bak’s model of two-dimensional sandpiles.}

The aim of this research is to delve into how the graphical user interface (GUI) integrates into contemporary audiovisual discourse, focusing on its potential as a spatial metaphor. To that end, a theoretical framework is built on the concept of space as a tool and its instrumentalization in the GUI throughout the years, with a view to design a taxonomy in relation to the different ways in which the GUI integrates into digital image composition. The article concludes that the ability to operate in the virtual and physical space, moving between the logic of the tool and its potential as spatial metaphor, provides the GUI with the necessary specificity to be considered a key cultural element for analysing new media’s visual identity.}

abstract = {The accuracy of power production predictions made using a linear model, Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program, and the computational fluid dynamics model, Meteodyn WT, was assessed for a Seongsan wind farm on Jeju Island, South Korea. The actual data on power production from 10 Vestas V80 2 MW wind turbines were collected through a supervisory control and data acquisition system. Wind data were collected over a period of 1 year from a 70-m-height met mast which was about 1.6 km away from the wind farm. The two applications were used for estimating the annual energy production for both an entire wind farm and an individual wind turbine and accomplished this by assessing five different wind farm sizes ranging from 5 km × 5 km to 20 km × 20 km. The results showed that Meteodyn WT software performed better than the Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program in predicting power production for all the five domain sizes studied. For the entire wind farm, the relative error in annual energy production prediction was from 2.5% to 3.5% when running Meteodyn WT, while ranging from 3.8% to 11.5% when running WindPRO. While a little overestimation in the capacity factor occurred using the WindPRO application, a little underestimation was found using Meteodyn WT.}

We view the monster as a computational entity, which we approach through our theory of game-play coupled with the concepts of loss aversion and endowment effect. Of particular interest is player perception of the threat posed by monsters as they perturb the experience of progression and the sensation of control within the game. We scrutinize this aspect from a situational as well as an existential perspective. Furthermore, we advance an analytical scheme of the threat of the computational monster, which is radically different from the traditional academic approach with its emphasis on the representation of monsters. Overall, we argue that the threat players perceive when facing monsters in computer games springs more from the computational nature of monsters—how they upset progression and the feeling of control—and less from the representation of the monster(s).}

The authors present a computational hypothesis that describes the skeleton as emerging from the interaction of three factors: (a) The topological map is represented as a bipartite graph of places and paths, where a path is a one-dimensional ordered set of places; (b) a traveler incrementally accumulates topological relationships, including the relation of a place to a path serving as a dividing boundary separating two regions; and (c) the wayfinding algorithm prefers paths rich in boundary relations so they are likely to acquire more boundary relations. This positive-feedback loop leads to an oligarchy of paths rich in boundary relations. The authors present preliminary computational and empirical tests for this hypothesis, and provide initial results.}

The framework is developed through an extensive literature review, drawing from a diverse range of sources. It integrates technical proficiencies, soft skills, adaptability, a global perspective, stakeholder collaboration, experiential learning, predictive skills, and a commitment to continuous curriculum updates to create a holistic educational model. The conceptual framework places technical skills at its core, and expertise in emerging technologies. Soft skills such as critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration, are integrated to foster a well-rounded skill set. A transdisciplinary approach encourages exploration beyond traditional LIS boundaries. The LISI4C framework also underscores the importance of sense-making, adaptability, and a global perspective in preparing graduates for the dynamic 4IR landscape. This paper contributes to the LIS education field by offering a forward-looking LISI4C framework that aligns LIS curriculum with the requirements of 4IR. The framework draws upon key elements, including technical proficiencies, soft skills, adaptability, a global perspective, stakeholder collaboration, experiential learning, predictive skills, and continuous curriculum updates, to create a holistic and forward-looking educational model.}

In particular, the introduction of material variation reconfigures the design space. Through the precise specification of their stiffness, it is possible to control and pre-calibrate the bending behaviour of a composite element. This material capacity challenges architecture’s existing methods for design, specification and prediction. In this paper, we demonstrate how architects might connect the designed nature of composites with the design of bending-active structures, through computational strategies. We report three built structures that develop architecturally oriented design methods for bending-active systems using composite materials. These projects demonstrate the application and limits of the introduction of advanced engineering simulation into an architectural workflow, and the extension of architecture’s existing physics-based approaches.}

It proposed a hybrid shell element model considering the strain-rate-sensitive failure criterion. This model innovatively provided a resolution of the yarn level to better capture the unique properties of the woven fabric, such as yarn crimp, sliding contact between yarns, stress transmission on yarns and yarn broken. The fabric is modeled using a hybrid shell element analysis approach aim of reducing the complexity and computational expense while ensuring accuracy. The response characteristics of fabric under high velocity ballistic impact are studied by applying a 3D finite element program DYNA3D in this paper and the experimental investigation had been taken by Shim et al. According to the computational and experimental results, transverse deflection distribution and stress transmission of fabrics are presented. The ballistic limit, energy absorption, remaining velocity are calculated by simulation models and compared with the experimental results. This approach is also validated by comparing it against a 2D uniform shell model and a 3D interlacing shell model. The results show that the hybrid model can accurately reflect the buckling and fluctuation behavior of fabrics and has a relatively few computational consumption at the same time.}

The dielectric response of these anisotropic and periodic structures was mathematically represented through a quasi-static approximation using the Laplace equation. The amount of inclusions was varied in order to represent diluted and concentrated systems and structures were assessed for the whole feasible range of volume fractions.

The temperature stratification method obtains relatively accurate computation results and takes a relatively short computation time, which is about 2 to 3 hours. Therefore, this method is most suitable for the performance analysis of this system. The deviation of the computational results of the uniform temperature method is great, and the time consumed is similar to that of the temperature stratification method. Therefore, this method is not recommended herein. Based on the above analyses, the temperature stratification method is applied to analyze the influence of the embedded depth of water tank, the thickness of thermal insulation material, and the collection area on the performance of this system.

abstract = {Infrared radiation signatures of gas turbine engine exhaust are suppressed markedly when equipped with a serpentine nozzle compared to an axisymmetric nozzle. The aim of this paper is to research more detailed flow characteristics of the serpentine nozzle, and to this end a double serpentine nozzle cold fluid test was conducted in this paper, static pressures on the nozzle walls surface were measured, and schlieren flow visualizations downstream of the nozzle exit were observed. Then numerical simulations of the experimental model were carried out using CFD software with k-ɛ turbulence model adopted. And the effects of geometric design parameters (the length ratio of first S length to second S length and the centerline distributions) on serpentine nozzle performance were investigated numerically. Detailed flow characteristics were presented including the distributions of static pressure, Ma number (streamlines), wall shear stress (limited streamlines), and the total pressure. Results show good agreement between the experimental data and computation. Static pressure distributions on the upper and down walls surface of double serpentine nozzle are completely different compared to the traditional axisymmetric nozzle. The rapid turning and steep passage slope of the serpentine nozzle would result in high friction loss and strong secondary flow loss, hence the value of the length ratio of first S passage to second S passage is recommended to be chosen from 2:5 to 2:3. The centerline distributions are crucial to the nozzle design for its influence on air acceleration inside the nozzle. The centerlines with a rapid turning at the exit would result in a high Ma number, which brings on high friction loss and secondary loss at the turnings. For maximum efficiency of centerline distributions, it is recommended that curves with a gentle turning at each serpentine passage exit should be chosen.}
