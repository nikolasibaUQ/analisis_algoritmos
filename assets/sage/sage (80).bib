abstract = {This study tested the potential of a technological intervention procedure for promoting letter-naming and initial-phoneme detection skills among preschoolers at risk for Specific Learning Disorder. The study rational is based on evidence for paired associated learning of visual-verbal stimuli, integrated with the use of a tangible technological device (educational floor robot) as means for promoting letter knowledge. Two intervention groups (N = 60) participated. The intervention lasted for eight sessions of phonological training; each dedicated to one target letter. Participants were asked to navigate the robot’s path from a current stopping point to the next according to phonological information processing. Both groups went through the same procedure, but using a different type of mat (one with and one without a visual form of the letter). A control group (N = 30) of at-risk preschoolers received no intervention except for their preschool educational routine. We found that children who participated in phonological training with linkage to the visual form of the letter scored higher in post-intervention tests. Among other proposed explanations, we mention the advantages of using a tangible robot and seemingly three-dimensional letters, along with the tendency to consider visual features while processing language stimulus among children with dyslexia.}

abstract = {The carbon nanotubes/nanofibers reinforced composites (CNRC) show great mechanical properties. There are several methods to simulate the mechanical properties of composites. Among the modeling techniques, embedded region (ER) shows the possibility for direct multi-scale simulation. A comparative study among beam element embedded model, solid element embedded model, as well as common solid element model is carried out. Programs developed in Matlab are utilized to generate geometric configurations, and finite element models are obtained from MSC.Patran with a script written in the Patran command language (PCL). Besides, a set of parametric studies are performed to investigate the influence of the aspect ratios of nanofibers and load cases on the mechanical properties of CNRC. The result shows that the ER technique is reliable to represent composites though neglecting the localized stress concentration, and beam element embedded models are trustworthy only for nanofibers with a large aspect ratio.}

abstract = {As a special measure in lightweight design, residual stresses can be used for improving the stability and vibration behaviour of thin-walled structures. In contrast to the common practice of inducing proper residual stresses by mechanically caused local plastic deformation, in the present paper it is shown by numerical procedures as well as by experiments how such beneficial residual stresses can be produced by a proper heat treatment using laser. This is shown by simple plate examples, for proof of concept. A finite element approach is combined with algorithms simulating the heat input from laser beams. The analyses comprise investigations of a single laser dot for studying the fundamental behaviour of laser treatment according to the abovementioned aspects, and – for practical applications – continuously moving and intermittently acting beams are considered. Unwanted effects, such as distortions and possible instabilities appearing during the laser treatment, are considered as well, and methods are presented for avoiding them. A number of generic laser tracks as well as patterns of laser dots of different configurations are investigated. Experiments were performed which confirm the potential of laser treatment of plates for improving stability and dynamic behaviour.}

abstract = {Backgrounds Hemodynamics plays an important role in the natural history of the process of rupture and recurrence of intracranial aneurysms. This study aimed to investigate the role of hemodynamics for recurrence in a vertebral artery dissecting aneurysm (VADA). Methods A patient with a ruptured VADA firstly treated by low-profile visualized intraluminal support (LVIS)-assisted coiling, and was implanted with a Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) after aneurysm recurrence. Finite element analysis and computational fluid dynamics simulations were conducted in 6 serial imaging procedures, and the calculated hemodynamics was correlated with aneurysm recurrence. Results Wall shear stress (WSS) was not effectively suppressed, resulting in aneurysm recurrence with initial entry tear to occur above the protuberance after 7 months of LVIS stent-assisted coiling. With the implantation of PED, WSS, inflow stream and velocity at the aneurysm neck significantly decreased. During the 3-month follow-up after PED deployment, there was significant shrinkage of the sac and the blood flow in the sac was reduced considerably. The 27-month follow-up after PED deployment indicated the aneurysm was stable. Conclusions The present case study suggests that insufficient suppression of high WSS and high inflow velocity at the neck of the parent artery, especially near the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, might be associated with aneurysm recurrence.}

All too often, with so much information and so many activities involved, it is difficult for decision-makers to determine in an objective fashion an appropriate course of action. It would appear that a holistic rather than a reductionist approach would be advantageous. The aim of this paper is to review how formal systems thinking can aid decision-making in complex situations. Consideration is given as to how the use of a number of systems modelling methodologies can help in gaining an understanding of a complex decision situation. This in turn can enhance the possibility of a decision being made in a more rational, explicit and transparent fashion. The arguments and approaches are illustrated using examples taken from the public health arena.}

abstract = {This study reflects on Harold Kincaid and Jule Zahle’s view that there is no necessary association between methodological individualism and agent-based models because the analysis of social phenomena in terms of the latter cannot always be regarded as an implementation of the former. Their view remains in contention with the standpoint of several philosophers of science and social scientists, including Chen and Di Iorio. Kincaid and Zahle’s main argument against such a standpoint is that agent-based simulation is compatible with holistic explanations that are at odds with methodological individualism. The following study argues that Kincaid and Zahle’s conclusion remains untenable since it stems from inaccurate historical assumptions concerning the tradition of methodological individualism and the way the individualism-holism debate is understood within this tradition.}

abstract = {The accuracy of power production predictions made using a linear model, Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program, and the computational fluid dynamics model, Meteodyn WT, was assessed for a Seongsan wind farm on Jeju Island, South Korea. The actual data on power production from 10 Vestas V80 2 MW wind turbines were collected through a supervisory control and data acquisition system. Wind data were collected over a period of 1 year from a 70-m-height met mast which was about 1.6 km away from the wind farm. The two applications were used for estimating the annual energy production for both an entire wind farm and an individual wind turbine and accomplished this by assessing five different wind farm sizes ranging from 5 km × 5 km to 20 km × 20 km. The results showed that Meteodyn WT software performed better than the Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program in predicting power production for all the five domain sizes studied. For the entire wind farm, the relative error in annual energy production prediction was from 2.5% to 3.5% when running Meteodyn WT, while ranging from 3.8% to 11.5% when running WindPRO. While a little overestimation in the capacity factor occurred using the WindPRO application, a little underestimation was found using Meteodyn WT.}

While popular accounts of the Bitcoin network correctly report the massive scale of energy it consumes and its potential environmental ramifications, in practice, the material geographies of Bitcoin are highly uneven and intertwined with specific infrastructural, ecological, and economic systems. In this article, we examine Bitcoin’s impacts on Chelan County, untangling the processes that occur as the distributed, digital infrastructure consumes the very real material resources of one place to produce digital goods used in another. In so doing, we examine not only the material costs of networks like Bitcoin, but also their historical ties to older processes of accumulation.}

As the fast-growing population of English learners (ELs) is expected to meet college- and career-ready content standards, the purpose of this article is to highlight key issues in aligning ELP standards with content standards. The overarching question is how to align ELP standards with academically rigorous and language-intensive disciplinary practices of content standards while respecting and maintaining the nature of the discipline within each area. I begin by describing contributions and shortcomings of content standards and ELP standards. Next, I propose consideration of three components in aligning ELP standards with content standards: (a) norms of disciplinary practices across content areas, (b) developmental progressions of disciplinary practices across K–12 grade levels or bands and across content areas, and (c) language use across levels of English proficiency. For each component, the challenges in establishing alignment and potential trade-offs in addressing these challenges are discussed. Finally, I highlight how these challenges present opportunities for substantive collaboration between EL education and content areas to move these fields forward and ensure ELs achieve academically rigorous content standards while developing ELP.}

abstract = {Background: A recent COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a large death toll rate globally and even no cure or vaccine has been successfully employed to combat this disease. Patients have been reported with multi-organ dysfunction along with acute respiratory distress syndrome which implies a critical situation for patients and made them difficult to breathe and survive. Moreover, pathology of COVID-19 is also related to cytokine storm which indicates the elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-18 along with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Among them, the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 has been reported to be induced via binding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS)-CoV-2 to the host receptors. Methodology: Interleukin-6 blockade has been proposed to constitute novel therapeutics against COVID-19. Thus, in this study, 15 phytocompounds with known antiviral activity have been subjected to test for their inhibitory effect on IL-6. Based on the affinity prediction, top 3 compounds (isoorientin, lupeol, and andrographolide) with best scores were selected for 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation and MMGB/PBSA binding free energy analysis. Results: Three phytocompounds including isoorientin, lupeol, and andrographolide have shown strong interactions with the targeted protein IL-6 with least binding energies (−7.1 to −7.7 kcal/mol). Drug-likeness and ADMET profiles of prioritized phytocompounds are also very prominsing and can be further tested to be potential IL-6 blockers and thus benficial for COVID-19 treatment. The moelcular dynamics simulation couple with MMGB/PBSA binding free energy estimation validated conformational stability of the ligands and stronger intermolecular binding. The mean RMSD of the complexes is as: IL6-isoorientin complex (3.97 Å ± 0.77), IL6-lupeol (3.97 Å ± 0.76), and IL6-andrographolide complex (3.96 Å ± 0.77). In addition, the stability observation was affirmed by compounds mean RMSD: isoorientin (0.72 Å ± 0.32), lupeol (mean 0.38 Å ± 0.08), and andrographolide (1.09 Å ± 0.49). A similar strong agreement on systems stability was unraveled by MMGB/PBSA that found net binding net ~ −20 kcal/mol for the complexes dominated by van der Waal interaction energy. Conclusion: It has been predicted that proposing potential IL-6 inhibitors with less side effects can help critical COVID-19 patients because it may control the cytokine storm, a major responsible factor of its pathogenesis. In this study, 3 potential phytocompounds have been proposed to have inhibitory effect on IL-6 that can be tested as potential therapeutic options against SARS-CoV-2.}

Methods Twelve commercially available antibiotics were tested S. aureus and S. epidermidis by antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST). Qualitative analysis of phytochemicals was performed to evaluate the presence of certain secondary metabolites. The activity of Z. armatum extracts against S. aureus and S. epidermidis was measured as a maximum zone of inhibition exhibited by each leaf and fruit extract. An in-silico study was conducted on flavonoids and alkaloids to show their binding affinity with the PBP2a receptor protein of S. aureus and TcaR of S. epidermidis. Results The AST revealed that S. aureus was resistant to Penicillin, Ampicillin, Clindamycin, Vancomycin, Rifampicin, Novobiocin, and Oxacillin, whereas S. epidermidis was resistant to Streptomycin, Oxacillin, Tetracycline, and Novobiocin. Qualitative analysis of phytochemicals resulted in the presence of Saponins, fixed oils, flavonoids, alkaloids, starch, and fatty acids in both leaf and fruit extracts. The maximum zone of inhibition against S. aureus was produced by methanolic leaf extracts of Z. armatum and chloroform fruit extracts. For S. epidermidis, the best activity was exhibited by benzene leaf extracts and methanolic fruit extracts. An in-silico study showed that flavonoids Nitidine and Nevadensin exhibited binding affinity with the PBP2a receptor protein higher than selected antibiotics, ie, Penicillin, Chloramphenicol, and Oxacillin. TcaR of S. epidermidis interacted with Tambuletin, followed by Nitidine and Kaempferol. Conclusion After in vitro testing, in silico analysis advised extracting and purifying the bioactive components from Z. armatum extracts that showed significant interaction with bacterial virulence proteins for use as natural antibiotics against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.}

Wall shear stress is thought to play a key role in the remodeling of the vessels exposed to abnormal levels and oscillating wall shear stress. In this study we sought to develop a framework suitable for thorough in vivo analyses of wall shear stress and vessel morphology of a-v fistulas in patients. Methods Using ultrasound and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) transverse image stacks from six patient a-v fistulas were obtained. From the image stacks three-dimensional geometries of the patient fistulas were created using dedicated segmentation software. Geometries of three a-v fistulas were imported into Finite Element software in order to perform fluid flow simulations of blood flows and frictional forces on the vessel walls in the a-v fistulas. Boundary conditions for the simulations were obtained using both a MRI Phase Contrast and an Ultrasound Doppler technique. Results The segmentation of the six fistulas of very different age and morphology (two end-to-side and four side-to-side) showed the ability of the approach to create geometries of various fistula morphologies. Simulations of the three fistulas showed an instant picture of the present status of the exposure to different levels of wall shear stress and the morphological status in the vessel remodeling process. Conclusion The study demonstrated the capability of the CFD framework to analyze patient a-v fistulas on a regular basis using both MRI and ultrasound-based approaches.}

In the current article, we extend this finding by simulating the performance of 3-month-old infants on a visual search task, using a multi-channel, image-filtering model of early visual processing. Model parameters were systematically varied to simulate developmental change in three neural components of visual selective attention: degree of oculomotor noise, growth of horizontal connections in visual cortex, and duration of recurrent processing in parietal cortex. While two of the three components—horizontal connections and recurrent parietal processing—are each able to account for the visual search performance of 3-month-olds, recurrent parietal processing also suggests a coherent pattern of developmental change in visual selective attention during early infancy. We conclude by highlighting plausible neural mechanisms for modulating recurrent parietal activity, including the development of feedback from prefrontal cortex.}

abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to examine and compare Singaporean physical education teachers’ attitudes towards information and communication technologies in physical education across different demographic groups that included gender, age, teaching experience, and school level. A total of 422 Singaporean full-time physical education teachers (mean age = 38.47 years, standard deviation = 8.31) completed the Physical Education Teachers’ Subjective Theories Questionnaire to assess their perspectives towards the integration of information and communication technologies into physical education teaching practice. Mann–Whitney U and Kruskal–Wallis H tests were conducted to examine the differences in participants’ attitudes across different demographic groups. Results revealed that attitudes towards information and communication technologies significantly differed between teachers of different gender, age, and teaching experience. However, no significant difference was found in attitudes towards information and communication technologies among teachers of different school levels. The findings of this study can inform policy-makers and stakeholders with an interest in promoting the integration of information and communication technologies in physical education.}

abstract = {Abstract In this article, aerodynamic optimization of a near-sonic passenger plane was conducted, starting with a conventional tail configuration. The genetic algorithm (GA) combined with the Euler simulations were used to maximize the lift-to-drag ratio (L/ D) at Mach 0.95. First, the wing planform shape, twist, and thickness ratios were optimized. As a result, information about the aerodynamic design parameters was obtained and the optimal individual was designed with high inboard sweep angle, long chord length at the root, and less outboard aerofoil thickness. Then, the point of junction was optimized by applying the optimized wing and fuselage. Through the optimization process, the incidence angles of the wing were reduced, and the shapes of the root leading edge were then sharpened to reduce the interference drag. By its aerodynamic performance, the optimized wing/body configuration showed the aerodynamic feasibility of near-sonic flight.}

abstract = {This article introduces a generative model of category representation that uses computer vision methods to extract category-consistent features (CCFs) directly from images of category exemplars. The model was trained on 4,800 images of common objects, and CCFs were obtained for 68 categories spanning subordinate, basic, and superordinate levels in a category hierarchy. When participants searched for these same categories, targets cued at the subordinate level were preferentially fixated, but fixated targets were verified faster when they followed a basic-level cue. The subordinate-level advantage in guidance is explained by the number of target-category CCFs, a measure of category specificity that decreases with movement up the category hierarchy. The basic-level advantage in verification is explained by multiplying the number of CCFs by sibling distance, a measure of category distinctiveness. With this model, the visual representations of real-world object categories, each learned from the vast numbers of image exemplars accumulated throughout everyday experience, can finally be studied.}

abstract = {For designing bolted connections in machinery applications, it is necessary to estimate the stiffness of the threaded connection. This work provides a new method for computing the stiffness of engaged screw in bolted connections according to the load distribution in screw thread. Finite element analysis is performed by building the three-dimensional model of threaded connection. A set of tensile tests are exerted to validate the accuracy of the suggested model of threaded connection. A good agreement is obtained when the analytical results are compared with finite element analysis results, experimental data, and Yamamoto method. Results reveal that the ultimate strength of thread connections is obviously lower than that of thread material. In addition, the results of calculation and finite element analysis indicated that increasing Young’s modulus of material and the engaged length or decreasing thread pitch could increase the stiffness of the thread portion of a bolt and nut.}
