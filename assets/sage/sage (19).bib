abstract = {Purpose: This study sought to validate the Skills for Future Work Scale for its use with professional/vocational training (PT) and baccalaureate students. Methods: A total of 1,159 students were recruited. Structural equation analysis was performed using IBM Amos Graphics®. Results: Excellent fit indices were obtained, forming a final scale composed of nine indicators and two factors. The first dimension was associated with cognitive skills and adaptability, grouping together the skills of finding meaning, adaptable thinking, and understanding management. The second dimension comprises collaborative skills, as social intelligence and virtual collaboration. Discussion: Collaboration skills were more developed within those undertaking PT, while baccalaureate students had more strongly developed mastery over new media. This scale allows to know effectively the development of the work skills set by the European Union in the 2030 horizon. These findings contribute interesting data regarding the development of training strategies to support insertion into the job market.}

abstract = {Since the first phase of the lockdown in Malaysia, the cinema has been the place which best exemplifies the implementation of the control order in the venue-based sectors. After almost 2 years of physical distancing and lifestyle changes, the authority attempted to bring a new form of “normal life” to its residents. Such a decision witnessed more economic sectors were permitted to reopen, cinema among them. This study employed a mixed-method approach which aims to identify the emerging factors which inform about Malaysian audiences’ perception of cinema-going in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It examines the audiences with the help of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as this theory claims that people are more likely to act in a certain way if they feel certain behaviors will lead to specific results that are in keeping with their values. This study identified the attitude toward cinema reopening and readiness toward visiting cinema are able to significantly predict all the related factors of cinemagoers’ willingness in the post COVID-19 era. The results informed on the concerns of their family members, friends, and those with whom they have regular physical contact have become the agent of decision-making in terms of cinema-going.}

abstract = {Computer programming provides a framework for interdisciplinary learning in sciences, arts and languages. However, increasing integration of programming in K–12 shows that the block-based and text-based dichotomy of programming environments does not reflect the spectrum of their affordance. Hence, educators are confronted with a fundamental hurdle of matching programming environments with learners’ cognitive abilities and learning objectives. This study addresses this challenge by analyzing 111 articles evaluating the affordances of programming environments to identify both structural and theoretical models to support educators’ choice of programming environments. The following dimensions of programming environments were identified: connectivity mode, interface natural language, language inheritance, age appropriateness, cost of environment, output interface, input interface, and project types. For each of these dimensions, the synthesis of the literature ranged from examining its nature and effect on learning programming to the implications of choosing an environment and the critical gaps that future studies should address. The findings offer instructors useful parameters to compare and assess programming environments’ suitability and alignment with learning objectives.}

abstract = {The use of computational processes in architecture is a widespread practice which draws on a set of theories of computer science developed in the 60s and 70s. With the advent of computers, many of these methodologies were developed in research centres in the USA and the UK. Focussing on this period, this paper investigates the importance of the German Hochschule fur Gestaltung, Ulm (HfG) design school in the early stages of computation in design and architecture. Even though there were no computers in the school, it may be argued that its innovative pedagogy and distinguished faculty members launched analogical computational design methods that can be seen as the basis for further computational approaches in architecture. The paper draws on archive material, as well as at an original interview with Tomas Maldonado, to propose that the remarkable work pursued by Tomas Maldonado (the educational project), Max Bense (information aesthetics) and Horst Rittel (scientific methods) was fundamental in establishing HfG Ulm as the forerunner of computation in architecture.}

abstract = {Unlike other technologies that augment human physical skills and abilities, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies interact with human thinking skills nurtured through various educational processes. Hence, advances in these technologies challenge the education sector to reimagine the suitable intellectual formation of students in the AI age. It is observed that as soon as AI tools acquire certain cognitive skills, humans tend to delegate those skills to such tools, risking redundancy in their personal and professional lives. Therefore, anticipating an ever-increasing involvement of AI tools in various cognitive processes, educational systems must equip students with both AI-collaborative and AI-complementary thinking skills, making them resilient to the advancements of AI technologies. Furthermore, it demands that educators continually redefine the spectrum of thinking skills required for and imparted to students in the AI age. This article aims to develop a comprehensive taxonomy of educational objectives for AI-natives by reimagining thinking skills relevant in the AI age. It is intended to help educational policymakers worldwide reimagine the appropriate set of thinking skills relevant for students in the AI age. Additionally, the article provides important insights to restructure contemporary educational practices to meet the requirements of the holistic formation of the AI-natives.}

We focus, in particular, on how this adoption of novel forms of evidence impacts corpus design and interpretation (which we tie to matters of casing), theoretical elaboration (which we associate to moving empirical claims across scales and empirical domains), and verification (which we see as a process of reflexive scaffolding of theoretical claims). We provide an example of the use of this framework through a study of the marketization of social scientific knowledge in the United Kingdom.}

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the computational experiment approach, learning styles, epistemic beliefs, and engagement with the inquiry process on the learning performance of pre-service engineering students. The study used the Felder-Silverman learning style model (FSLSM), in order to provide information for the relation of FSLSM with the learning environment in order to examine whether the strength of learning styles has an effect on the students’ learning performance in mismatched courses. Our objective was: a) to investigate whether students with a strong preference for a specific learning style have more difficulties in learning, if their learning style is not supported in the learning environment; b) if the methodology of the computational experiment has an impact on students independently of their learning style; and c) if the epistemological beliefs are related to different learning styles. The learning environment was based on the methodology of the computational experiment and applications were developed using the Easy Java Simulator software, while the inquiry based teaching and learning process was adopted. The questionnaire responses were gathered from 79 pre-service engineering students in a higher education institute in Greece. Results indicate that students with no preferred learning style have a better learning performance in mismatched courses.}

abstract = {Background/Context: Bi/multilingual students’ STEM learning is better supported when educators leverage their language and cultural practices as resources, but STEM subject divisions have been historically constructed based on oppressive, dominant values and exclude the ways of knowing of nondominant groups. Truly promoting equity requires expanding and transforming STEM disciplines. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This article contributes to efforts to illuminate emergent bi/multilingual students’ ways of knowing, languaging, and doing in STEM. We follow the development of syncretic literacies in relation to translanguaging practices, asking, How do knowledges and practices from different communities get combined and reorganized by students and teachers in service of new modeling practices? Setting and Participants: We focus on a seventh-grade science classroom, deliberately designed to support syncretic literacies and translanguaging practices, where computer science concepts were infused into the curriculum through modeling activities. The majority of the students in the bilingual program had arrived in the United States at most three years before enrolling, from the Caribbean and Central and South America. Research Design: We analyze one lesson that was part of a larger research–practice partnership focused on teaching computer science through leveraging translanguaging practices and syncretic literacies. The lesson was a modeling and computing activity codesigned by the teacher and two researchers about post–Hurricane María outmigration from Puerto Rico. Analysis used microethnographic methods to trace how students assembled translanguaging, social, and schooled practices to make sense of and construct models. Findings/Results: Findings show how students assembled representational forms from a variety of practices as part of accomplishing and negotiating both designed and emergent goals. These included sensemaking, constructing, explaining, justifying, and interpreting both the physical and computational models of migration. Conclusions/Recommendations: Implications support the development of theory and pedagogy that intentionally make space for students to engage in meaning-making through translanguaging and syncretic practices in order to provide new possibilities for lifting up STEM learning that may include, but is not constrained by, disciplinary learning. Additional implications for teacher education and student assessment practices call for reconceptualizing schooling beyond day-to-day curriculum as part of making an ontological shift away from prioritizing math, science, and CS disciplinary and language objectives as defined by and for schooling, and toward celebrating, supporting, and centering students’ diverse, syncretic knowledges and knowledge use.}

Training demands are thus arising for specific skills and competencies that would make current students and employment seekers more employable. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the twenty-first century’s major employability skills and competencies as well as the main demand trends for skills and competencies. METHODS: An international panel of experts (from Spain, Thailand and Poland), from both, academic and professional business backgrounds, were asked to quantitatively project the importance of different generic and specific skills and competencies over the next five years. They were asked to do so twice, once before and once after a four-year interval (in 2016 and in 2019). Each time, they were interviewed to discuss the results. RESULTS: The most valued employability skills were of a generic nature, in all three countries. Regarding specific skills, those of a social and managerial nature were the most highly valued. Work experience and formal education became less relevant for employability. CONCLUSIONS: The study’s results can lead to recommendations on how to design a more employability-oriented curriculum in educational institutions.}

The purpose of the study is to examine why this occurred, and the authors looked at the teachers’ modeling discourse. Using two theories to connect to practice (terministic screens, and schema theory), the authors collected data via the surveys, interviews, and email reflections. The authors analyzed the results via coding to explore participants’ concept of models and the potential difficulties of implementing computer modeling in their classrooms. Findings show that the term model was interpreted differently by the PD’s faculty team and participants. Further, the authors found that the majority of presenters held differing theories of models than the participants. Participant concepts of models did improve slightly after the PD, but lingering model concepts caused confusion with the anticipated PD results. Conclusions include five general modeling concepts which are presented and explained. Implications are provided showcasing articulated keys for delivering PD that assists in eliminating discursive and theoretical issues. Included are considerations for STEM teacher educators, PD providers, and K-12 teachers. The main study limitations include mixed K-12 teaching participants, distance between participants, a self-selected population, and non-generalizable findings based on qualitative work. Future directions are outlined.}

abstract = {Piaget’s (1953, 1955) increasingly controversial claim that infant knowledge depends upon action need not be rejected, provided the mechanisms underlying infant ability are conceptualized appropriately in computational terms. Computational concepts solve many problems caused by Piaget’s notions of perception, behaviour, schemes, reciprocal-assimilation and action. Artificial intelligence work on vision offers a way of explaining early perceptual abilities that is precise, internally coherent and able to encompass recent findings of innate organization. Concepts from the procedural programming languages offer a way of accounting for both internal and overt aspects of behaviour, and for the functional coordination of perception and behaviour that characterizes infant anion. This perspective challenges Piaget’s view that development necessitates a radical reconstruction of action-based knowledge. Conceptualized computationally, perceptual-behavioural action can be seen to involve representation in a nontrivial sense. Restructuring of action mechanisms can account for some central phenomena of infant development.}

abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics is taught in many universities and is a trending elective option among engineering students. Although analyzing computational fluid dynamics simulations is exciting enough, the theory is equation intensive, sometimes very abstract and also difficult to visualize for the novice. A creative thinking based approach termed synectics, which involves analogies, was therefore applied in classroom teaching to increase student comfort with the equations. For this purpose six analogies encompassing basic computational fluid dynamics concepts were developed along with pictorial representations, and are presented in this work. These analogies were integrated into classroom teaching via synectics procedures. Student feedback was positive and reflected higher engagement with the course compared to when the metaphoric activity was not implemented. This work attempts to demonstrate the feasibility and value of applying creative techniques, even when teaching a highly structured and equation oriented course such as computational fluid dynamics.}

abstract = {Coding is increasingly popular in schools around the world and is often taught by non-specialist teachers as an integrated task with other subject areas. In this article, we explore the relationship between computer science (CS) concepts and students’ multimodal expression in a coding animated narrative (CAN) task in the context of an integrated English-Technology unit of learning. Through this collective case study, we explore how CS concepts underpin semiotic elements of an animated narrative, analyse the factors that influence the extent to which students exercise those concepts, and reveal the tensions and opportunities that a CAN task may present for learning computer science concepts in regular, non-specialist, cross-curricular classrooms. The findings suggest that CAN tasks are unique in presenting opportunities for students to learn challenging CS concepts such as synchronisation and parallelism. At the same time, CAN tasks present tensions for teaching CS concepts in non-specialist classrooms, where student projects are often judged on their visual qualities. In such settings, procedural, rather than conceptual knowledge, may be a more efficient route to creative outcomes. It also means that drawing skills need to be prioritised. Role specialisation often led to better quality projects but at the expense of individual students’ conceptual development in computer science.}

abstract = {Although the current landscape in education emphasizes the importance of developing students’ information literacy in formal education settings, little attention has been paid to information literacy within the context of social media use. This study investigated the relationship between information literacy and social media competence (SMC) among 1843 university students. This was done in order to increase knowledge of the components that may be important for preparing university students to be information literate citizens in social media environments. Students’ information literacy and SMC were measured by the Student Information Literacy Test and the SMC-CS scale respectively. Correlation and regression analyses were utilized to explore the relationship between university students’ information literacy and their SMC. The results showed that university students’ ability to utilize information technology to solve problems, and their sense of responsible behavior in cyberspace, are the most critical factors in predicting students’ SMC. Based on the findings, theoretical and practical implications are discussed in terms of enhancing university students’ information literacy and SMC.}
