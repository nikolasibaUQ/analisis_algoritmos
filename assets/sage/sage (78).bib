abstract = {Cognitive radios are expected to play an important role in capturing the constantly growing traffic interest on remote networks. To improve the usage of the radio range, a cognitive radio hub detects the weather, evaluates the open-air qualities, and then makes certain decisions and distributes the executives’ space assets. The cognitive radio works in tandem with artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence methodologies to provide a flexible and intelligent allocation for continuous production cycles. The purpose is to provide a single source of information in the form of a survey research to enable academics better understand how artificial intelligence methodologies, such as fuzzy logics, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks, are used to various cognitive radio systems. The various artificial intelligence approaches used in cognitive radio engines to improve cognition capabilities in cognitive radio networks are examined in this study. Computerized reasoning approaches, such as fuzzy logic, evolutionary algorithms, and artificial neural networks, are used in the writing audit. This topic also covers cognitive radio network implementation and the typical learning challenges that arise in cognitive radio systems.}

abstract = {Software studies is a research field that focuses on the social and cultural implications of the software. They are grounded by interdisciplinarity, borrowing to digital humanities, cultural studies, or new media studies. Their application domains are as heterogeneous as software can be, from interfaces to new digital mediatic forms. This paper examines the relevance of software studies for journalism studies in the context of automated news production, where technological artifacts can also be understood as being shaped by professional values and cultural practices. It also explores methods nourished by software studies’ theories to tackle news automation through a process-oriented approach. The cursor is placed on the materiality of the upstream components of automated news production: the data that feed the systems and the process that will make the news. Automated news production appears as a remixed editorial process nourished by previous editorial experiences that will be standardized through a some-how imitation game where technological and human mediation interplay. This paper addresses the issue of transparency with the flattening of the processes at work, relying on theories and methodological tools based on software studies.}

The simulations are performed using KIVA-3V computer code coupled with reduced chemical kinetics. Low (40 per cent) to heavy (70 per cent) EGR rates are applied to study the effects of reduced intake oxygen concentration on combustion and emissions. Model predictions of cylinder pressure and emissions are first validated against experimental data. Model-predicted temporal and spatial evolution of in-cylinder mixture in φ—T coordinates is then used to explain the fundamentals of PCCI combustion and emissions. Using computational analysis, it is shown that lower exhaust soot emissions for the lower EGR dilution cases (45 per cent) are due to higher soot oxidation rates, and lower exhaust soot emissions for very high EGR rates (70 per cent) are due to lower soot formation rates. The trend seen in NOx emissions are primarily attributable to the inert effect of EGR dilution and varied ignition delay caused by varied percentages of oxygen in the intake mixture.}

This is an exploratory, naturalistic research study of students’ thoughts and behavior in this context. It differs from most earlier work in the field of computer-assisted graphing in three major ways: first, we focus broadly on a wide variety of types of graphs, used in several different subject matter contexts; second, we conduct research into problem solving processes in an unmodified whole-classroom environment; third, we supplement participant observations on student cognition with extensive behavioral sequence data gathered automatically and unobtrusively by the computer. We detail our attempts to develop, adapt, and apply quantitative methods of analysis of behavioral sequences which are potentially applicable to such data gathered for a large number of students.}

abstract = {The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of advance auditory cuing of control mode changes in an adaptively automated system on human performance and to explain cognitive behaviors at mode changes by using a computational cognitive model. A dual-task piloting simulation, involving tracking and tactical decision making, was developed to collect human performance data with auditory cuing or no cuing of mode transitions in the tactical task. Computational GOMS (goal, operators, methods, and selection) language models were coded to simulate user behavior on the basis of expectation of increased memory transactions (between long-term and working stores) at mode transitions. The models were applied to the same task simulation and scenarios performed by the humans. Human performance data did not reveal differences between cued and no-cue trials possibly because of distraction from the tracking (secondary loading) task. Comparison of results for human and model output demonstrated the model to be descriptive of the pattern of human performance across conditions but not accurate in predicting timing of memory use in preparing for manual control. A refined GOMS language model was coded on the basis of a modified assumption that memory stores are used on an ad hoc basis after high-workload mode transitions and with consideration of human parallel processing in dual-task performance. Results revealed the refined model to have greater plausibility for representing actual behavior. The manner of operator use of memory stores for controlling an adaptive system provides insight into the impact of cuing of mode transitions and a basis for future systems design.}

abstract = {A conceptual model of the human haptic system in relation to object identification is presented. The model encompasses major architectural elements including representations of haptically accessible object properties and exploratory procedures (EPs)—dedicated movement patterns that are specialized to extract particular properties. These architectural units are related in processing-specific ways. Properties are associated with exploratory procedures in keeping with the extent to which a given procedure delivers information about a given property. The EPs are associated with one another in keeping with their compatibility, as determined by parameters of motor execution and interactions with the object and the workspace. The resulting architecture is treated as a system of constraints which guide the exploration of an object during the course of identification. The selection of the next step in a sequence of exploration requires that constraints be optimally satisfied. A network approach to constraint satisfaction is implemented and shown to account for a number of previous empirical results concerning the time course of exploration, object classification speed, and incidental learning about object properties. This system has potential applications for robotic haptic exploration.}

The characteristics of the formed density profiles were defined and their correlations to the process parameters and Brinell hardness and elastic recovery were analysed. Compression ratio and closing time had the strongest effect on the formation of the density profile, as well as the hardness and elastic recovery. The amount of localised deformation (peak area) did not have significant effect on the Brinell hardness or elastic recovery, whereas, the highest density achieved (peak density) and its location (peak distance) dominated the effect. Brinell hardness and elastic recovery were found to correlate well with each other.}

abstract = {The quality of intradisciplinary thinking during research design is crucial not only for alleviating multifaceted problems – such as global environmental change – but potentially to avoid worsening them. This article builds on the emphasis placed on research framing by human, physical and critical physical geographers by drawing from ideas on iterative framing in transdisciplinarity studies – as related to collaboration between geography’s internal subdisciplines – as well as from Gilles Deleuze, especially in Difference and Repetition (Deleuze, 1994 (1968)). Here, research reframing is based on a critical engagement with the contrasts in subdisciplinary foci and research methodologies, which I argue is achieved through a consideration of contrasting axiologies and facilitated by subdisciplinary encounter. I explore this approach to intradisciplinary thinking using examples from the literature in geography and beyond. Given that collaboration across research methodologies is challenging, I demonstrate one example practical approach to such intradisciplinary thinking: mapping. Different map-making and map-using activities can reflect contrasting forms of data and understandings from the field, and can therefore act as a shared space of encounter for geographers of all kinds.}

Using data-driven models, we identify these cues after removing attractiveness cues. In Experiment 1, we show that both judgments of trustworthiness and attractiveness of faces manipulated by a model of perceived trustworthiness change in the same direction. To control for the effect of attractiveness, we build two new models of perceived trustworthiness: a subtraction model, which forces the perceived attractiveness and trustworthiness to be negatively correlated (Experiment 2), and an orthogonal model, which reduces their correlation (Experiment 3). In both experiments, faces manipulated to appear more trustworthy were indeed perceived to be more trustworthy, but not more attractive. Importantly, in both experiments, these faces were also perceived as more approachable and with more positive expressions, as indicated by both judgments and machine learning algorithms. The current studies show that the visual cues used for trustworthiness and attractiveness judgments can be separated, and that apparent approachability and facial emotion are driving trustworthiness judgments and possibly general valence evaluation.}

abstract = {Background: The most important hallmark in the neuropathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the formation of amyloid-β (Aβ) fibrils due to the misfolding/aggregation of the Aβ peptide. Preventing or reverting the aggregation process has been an active area of research. Naturally occurring products are a potential source of molecules that may be able to inhibit Aβ42 peptide aggregation. Recently, we and others reported the anti-aggregating properties of curcumin and some of its derivatives in vitro, presenting an important therapeutic avenue by enhancing these properties. Objective: To computationally assess the interaction between Aβ peptide and a set of curcumin derivatives previously explored in experimental assays. Methods: The interactions of ten ligands with Aβ monomers were studied by combining molecular dynamics and molecular docking simulations. We present the in silico evaluation of the interaction between these derivatives and the Aβ42 peptide, both in the monomeric and fibril forms. Results: The results show that a single substitution in curcumin could significantly enhance the interaction between the derivatives and the Aβ42 monomers when compared to a double substitution. In addition, the molecular docking simulations showed that the interaction between the curcumin derivatives and the Aβ42 monomers occur in a region critical for peptide aggregation. Conclusion: Results showed that a single substitution in curcumin improved the interaction of the ligands with the Aβ monomer more so than a double substitution. Our molecular docking studies thus provide important insights for further developing/validating novel curcumin-derived molecules with high therapeutic potential for AD.}

The second approach is based on the classical Newton-Raphson or modified Newton-Raphson methods, while for the linearized problem in each iteration the preconditioned Lanczos method is employed. Both methodologies combine the convergence properties of Newton-like methods and the low storage requirements of pure iterative methods by varying the storage demands for the preconditioning matrix according to the available computer storage facilities.}

Using the CFD, air velocities at different locations of the nozzle were obtained and then drag forces acting on hair and yarn were computed. Z-twisted carded cotton yarns were produced at ring spinning machine with and without placing nozzle. Three nozzles were used, each having air inlets at different axial angle. Using the results of simulation, the role of air drag forces and angle of impact of air current on reduction in yarn hairiness could be explained. Nozzle-Ring yarns had a lower number of S3-hairs than the regular ring yarn. The drag forces played a dominant role in reducing the hairs. The angle of air inlets controlled the impact angle of air on the hair. At very high impact angle, curving of protruding hair was bound to occur during its folding, signifying the difficulty in wrapping the hair over the yarn and, hence, a lower reduction in hairiness.}

abstract = {The serious geological hazards occurred frequently in the last few years. They have inflicted heavy casualties and property losses. Hence, it is necessary to design a geological information service system to analyze and evaluate geological hazards. With the development of computer and Internet service model, it is now possible to obtain rich data and process the data with some advanced computing techniques under network environment. Then, some technologies, including cyber-physical system, Internet of Things, and cloud computing, have been used in geological information management. Furthermore, the concept of cyber-physical-social-thinking as a broader vision of the Internet of Things was presented through the fusion of those advanced computing technologies. Motivated by it, in this article, a novel modeling and computing method for geological information service system is developed in consideration of the complex data processing requirement of geological service under dynamic environment. Specifically, some key techniques of modeling the information service system and computing geological data via cyber-physical system and Internet of Things are analyzed. Moreover, to show the efficiency of proposed method, two application cases are provided during the cyber-physical-social-thinking modeling and computing for geological information service system.}
