abstract = {Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education initiatives have placed pressure on teachers to bring technology tools into classroom, including three-dimensional (3D) printing. Yet, little research has examined what specific math skills are required for 3D printing technology. This article describes a follow-up analysis of findings from a quasi-experimental study that tested feasibility of 3D geometry instruction, Anchored Instruction with Technology Applications (AITA), designed to help students visualize and construct 3D models based on Enhanced Anchored Instruction. Although we found that AITA improved math outcomes of students with math learning disabilities (MLD) in the previous analysis, we only used composite scores encompassing a variety of math and spatial tasks. In this study, we employed item response theory and differential item functioning to examine the impacts of MLD on students’ spatial thinking skills, understand the types of items to assess the intended skills in a valid way, and provide a detailed information of whether student ability and MLD status have caused different results to assess students’ spatial thinking skills. Results showed that students with MLD struggle to learn spatial thinking skills, and AITA was a significant positive indicator to improve spatial thinking skills for both students with and without MLD.}

abstract = {Abstract The development of intimal hyperplasia at arterial bypass graft anastomoses is a major factor responsible for graft failure. A revised surgical technique, involving the incorporation of a small section of vein (vein cuff) into the distal anastomosis of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts, alters the distribution of intimal hyperplasia and improves graft performance. Numerical and in vitro flow visualization experiments have been conducted to identify the flow behaviour in the cuffed bypass model and to determine whether the improved performance of the cuffed system can be accounted for by haemodynamic factors. The flowfield at the cuffed anastomosis is characterized by an expansive recirculation. Separation occurs at the graft heel, and at the cuff toe as the blood enters the recipient artery. Wall shear stresses in the vicinity of the cuff heel are low, but high shear stresses and large spatial gradients in the shearing force act for a time on the artery floor. In the conventional model, a less disturbed flow prevails while the gradients of shear stress on the floor are smaller. Aspects of the anastomotic haemodynamics are worsened when the cuff is employed. The superior patency rates of cuffed bypasses may not be explained purely on the basis of local haemodynamic factors.}

abstract = {In order to improve the correctness and efficiency of fault diagnosis, a novel hybrid intelligence method based on integrating rough set, genetic algorithms, and radial basic function neural network (RGRN) was proposed for motor fault diagnosis in the complicated CNC system in this article. In the proposed RGRN method, combination and condition supplement algorithm was used to deal with the incomplete fault data and the original data were discretized using genetic algorithms to construct a decision table. Rough set theory as a new mathematical tool was used to eliminate the redundant and irrelevant attributes in order to obtain the minimum rule set for reducing the number of input nodes of the radial basic function neural network. Genetic algorithms were directly used to optimize the structure and weights of radial basic function neural network to establish an optimized radial basic function neural network (GRN) model; then, the minimum rule set was inputted into the GRN model in order to obtain the optimized RGRN model. Finally, the completed fault symptom information was inputted into the RGRN model to obtain the fault diagnosis results. The robustness of the RGRN method was tested. Simulating experiments on motor fault diagnosis in the complicated CNC system show the RGRN method not only improves the global optimization performance and quickens the convergence speed, but also obtains the robust solution with a better quality.}

abstract = {Why do some individuals pick up arms as opposed to others who live under the same conditions? Environmental and group theories fail to differentiate between these individuals. In response, we apply the cognitive mapping approach and model violence as decisions based on chains of beliefs about various types of factors, including state aggression, access to violent groups, religion, and personal characteristics. Based on a double-paired comparison, data are constructed from ethnographic interviews with Muslim and non-Muslim individuals engaging in violent and nonviolent activity in authoritarian and democratic states—Egypt and Germany. The analysis develops a computational model formalizing the cognitive maps into Bayesian networks. In 477,604 runs, the model (1) identifies the beliefs connected to decisions, (2) traces inference chains antecedent to decisions, and (3) explores counterfactuals. This suggests that both violent and nonviolent activities are responses to state aggression, and not to Islam, group access, or personal characteristics.}

abstract = {The conventional rotor spinning unit generates flow vortices in the transfer channel upstream region which affect the fiber configuration and consequently yarn properties. Geometry and spinning parameters such as transfer channel length, inlet width, rotor outlet pressure, opening roller speed, and diameter were found to be key parameters influencing airflow characteristics. To reduce the flow vortices in the upper stream region, modifications of the transfer channel were proposed, and their airflow fields were analyzed using computational fluid dynamics. Three designs were studied: a round transfer channel inlet, a bypass channel for extra air supply, and one with both the bypass and the round inlet. Analysis of airflow revealed that the design with both round transfer channel inlet and a bypass proved to be very effective in properly directing the flow and minimizing vortices. The design was also characterized by smoother velocity streamlines and maximum mass flow across the transfer channel. A conventional rotor spinning unit was modified in which a round transfer channel inlet corner and a bypass channel were utilized to conduct the experimental tests. Three sets of yarn samples were produced using the conventional and modified rotor spinning units under different rotor speed conditions. Yarn properties were tested. Properties such as tenacity, CVm%, and thin and thick places of the spun yarns produced by the new design improved compared to that of the conventional yarn.}

abstract = {In this paper, a computational fluid dynamics trimming method is proposed and compared with wind tunnel experiment and the blade element method. The NASA’s generic ROBIN helicopter model is adopted for transient simulations to obtain the final main rotor trimming conditions. Totally three steps were applied to the computational fluid dynamics method. The first step is associated with no cyclic pitch motion, the second is regarding pure longitudinal cyclic pitch motion and the last is concerning with pure lateral cyclic pitch motion. At the same time, a simple linear equation system between the roll and pitching moment was established to get the final longitudinal and lateral cyclic pitch angles for the main rotor through the above three steps. An overset grid approach was used where the volume around each blade was modeled in an individual overset grid region. The rotor rotation was resolved with three degrees per time-step. Turbulence was modeled with the well-known SST K-omega model with second-order convection. The helicopter was in straight forward flight with an advance ratio of . Three sources of stick angles, which are also called rotor trimming angles, were shown and compared with each other. And the corresponding results were also plotted with a type of history plot in the computational fluid dynamics condition. In the simulations, the results became quasi periodic after about 1.5 rotations and four rotor rotations were simulated for each case. The pitch moment coefficient and roll moment coefficient were all trimmed to about zero by the computational fluid dynamics trimming method while moments were not removed thoroughly in the other two source conditions.}

abstract = {Abstract In this paper, experiments were carried out on a direct-injection diesel engine using a common-rail system, in order to study the effects of multi-injection modes on the combustion characteristics and pollutant emissions. A soot model was proposed for the post-injection mode, namely the Hiroyasu—Kodota averaged-reaction-rate soot model, which took into account both the chemical kinetics reaction and the turbulent mixing motion of the spray jet. Through integrating the revised soot model into a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, the combustion process and pollutants formation of the tested engine were simulated. The in-cylinder gas pressure and combustion heat release rate showed satisfactory agreement with measurements. The experimental data demonstrated that the pilot-injection mode was one of the most effective measures for reducing combustion noise. Meanwhile an optimum split-injection mode consisting of an appropriate pilot-injection fuel quantity combined with an optimal pilot-injection—main-injection interval could be achieved to decrease the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission while not causing the particulate matter (PM) emission to deteriorate very much. Two innovative concepts of an active thermo-atmosphere and a passive inert atmosphere were presented from numerical simulation to discuss the effect of the pilot-injection mode on the combustion behaviour of the main injection. Regarding the post-injection mode, its prominent advantage was to decrease significantly the PM emission without an NOx emission penalty. Furthermore, by CFD modelling of the soot formation process, it can be observed that the turbulent mixing motion caused by the post-injection spray played a vital role in the soot oxidization process.}

abstract = {Two-phase computational fluid dynamics modelling is used to investigate the magnitude of different contributions to the wet steam losses in a three-stage model low pressure steam turbine. The thermodynamic losses (due to irreversible heat transfer across a finite temperature difference) and the kinematic relaxation losses (due to the frictional drag of the drops) are evaluated directly from the computational fluid dynamics simulation using a concept based on entropy production rates. The braking losses (due to the impact of large drops on the rotor) are investigated by a separate numerical prediction. The simulations show that in the present case, the dominant effect is the thermodynamic loss that accounts for over 90% of the wetness losses and that both the thermodynamic and the kinematic relaxation losses depend on the droplet diameter. The numerical results are brought into context with the well-known Baumann correlation, and a comparison with available measurement data in the literature is given. The ability of the numerical approach to predict the main wetness losses is confirmed, which permits the use of computational fluid dynamics for further studies on wetness loss correlations.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systemic-to-pulmonary shunt is a palliative procedure used to decrease pulmonary blood flow in congenital heart diseases. Shunt stenosis or occlusion has been reported to be associated with mortality; therefore, the management of thrombotic complications remains a challenge for most congenital cardiovascular surgeons. Despite its importance, the optimal method for shunt anastomosis remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The study investigates the clinical benefits of the punch-out technique over conventional methods in the anastomosis process of Systemic-to-pulmonary shunt, focusing on its potential to reduce shunt-related complications. METHODS: Anastomotic models were created by two different surgeons employing both traditional slit and innovative punch-out techniques. Computational tomography was performed to construct three-dimensional models for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. We assessed the flow pattern, helicity, magnitude of wall shear stress, and its gradient. RESULTS: The anastomotic flow area was larger in the model using the punch-out technique than in the slit model. In CFD simulation, we found that using the punch-out technique decreases the likelihood of establishing a high wall shear stress distribution around the anastomosis line in the model. CONCLUSION: The punch-out technique emerges as a promising method in SPS anastomosis, offering a reproducible and less skill-dependent alternative that potentially diminishes the risk of shunt occlusion, thereby enhancing patient outcomes.}

abstract = {Film cooling effectiveness has been studied by using a computational approach based on solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. A wind tunnel test configuration is considered with a total of four cooling hole geometries as a cylindrical hole, a cylindrical hole with an upstream wedge (called ‘ramp’ thereafter), a shaped diffuser, and a double console slot. In all cases, the hole centreline has an inclination angle of 35° against the mainstream airflow and the blowing ratio is unity. Choosing the cylindrical model as a baseline, simulations have been carried out for grid convergence and turbulence model influence studies. Results are compared with available experimental data and other numerical predictions and good agreement has been achieved. Further computations continue with three remaining geometries, using the baseline flow conditions and configuration. Comparing to the results from the baseline model, it was found that the centreline adiabatic cooling effectiveness has shown incremental increases for the ‘ramp’ model, while results from the console slot model and the shape diffuser model have exhibited significant improvements by a factor of 1.5 and 2, respectively. The reason for such a step change in cooling effectiveness is mainly due to the weakening of the vortex structures in the vicinity of the hole exit, thus significantly reducing the entrainment of surrounding ‘hot’ fluids.}

abstract = {The blood pump is an implantable device with strict performance requirements. Any effective structural improvement will help to improve the treatment of patients. However, the research of blood pump structure improvement is a complex optimization problem with multiple parameters and objectives. This study takes the splitter blade as the object of structural improvement. Computational fluid mechanics and neural networks are combined in research and optimization. And hydraulic experiments and micro particle image velocimetry technology were used. In the optimization study, the number of blades, axial length and circumferential offset are optimization parameters, and hydraulic performance and hemolytic prediction index are optimization targets. The study analyzes the influence of each parameter on performance and completes the optimization of the parameters. In the results, the optimal parameters of number of blades, axial length ratio, and circumferential offset are 2.6° and 0.41°, respectively. Under optimized parameters, hydraulic performance can be significantly improved. And the results of hemolysis prediction and micro particle image velocimetry experiments reflect that there is no increase in the risk of hemolytic damage. The results of this study provide a method and ideas for improving the structure of the axial spiral blade blood pump. The established optimization method can be effectively applied to the design and research of axial spiral blade blood pumps with complex, high precision, and multiple parameters and targets.}

abstract = {A FORTRAN G/H computer program was derived for an IBM series 360/370 computer system (or compatible systems such as Amdol or Honeywell) that provides at least 1536-K of core storage. This large amount of core storage is usually provided via a VS-1 or VS-2 virtual memory system. This program provides a factor analytic solution for large 3-dimensional data matrices. The computational procedures employed are based upon those presented in Method III of Tucker (1966).}

abstract = {The serious geological hazards occurred frequently in the last few years. They have inflicted heavy casualties and property losses. Hence, it is necessary to design a geological information service system to analyze and evaluate geological hazards. With the development of computer and Internet service model, it is now possible to obtain rich data and process the data with some advanced computing techniques under network environment. Then, some technologies, including cyber-physical system, Internet of Things, and cloud computing, have been used in geological information management. Furthermore, the concept of cyber-physical-social-thinking as a broader vision of the Internet of Things was presented through the fusion of those advanced computing technologies. Motivated by it, in this article, a novel modeling and computing method for geological information service system is developed in consideration of the complex data processing requirement of geological service under dynamic environment. Specifically, some key techniques of modeling the information service system and computing geological data via cyber-physical system and Internet of Things are analyzed. Moreover, to show the efficiency of proposed method, two application cases are provided during the cyber-physical-social-thinking modeling and computing for geological information service system.}

abstract = {This paper presents a new computational framework to describe the evolution of grain structure during metal additive manufacturing and to simulate an inelastic deformation of the additively manufactured material, taking into account the grain structure explicitly. A combined effect of grain structure and loading conditions on the evolution of the stress–strain state in additively manufactured specimens is investigated. The results of the research highlight the need to account for the realistic microstructure, to properly describe the mechanical behaviour of additively manufactured specimens and parts. This is part of a thematic issue on Small Scale Mechanics - EUROMAT.}
