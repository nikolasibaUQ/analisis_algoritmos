abstract = {System availability is a key performance measure in the process industry. It ensures continuous operation of facilities to meet production targets, personnel safety and environmental sustainability. Process machinery condition assessment, early fault detection and its management are vital elements to ensure overall system availability. These elements can be explored and managed effectively by extracting hidden knowledge from machinery vibration information to improve plant availability and safe operations. This article describes a decision tree–based computational intelligence model using machinery vibration data to detect machinery faults, their severity, and suggests appropriate action to avoid unscheduled failures. Vibration data for this work were collected using a machinery simulator and real-world machine to show the applicability of the proposed model. Later, the data were analyzed to detect faults using decision tree–based model that was developed in MATLAB. Fault detection classification accuracies of 98% during training and 93% during testing showed excellent performance of the proposed model. The model also revealed that the proposed formulation has capability of detecting faults correctly in the range of 98%−99%. The results showed that the proposed decision tree–based model is effective in evaluating the condition of process machinery and predicting unscheduled equipment breakdowns with better accuracy and with reduced human effort.}

abstract = {The simulation of cardiac electrophysiology is a mature field in computational physiology. Recent advances in medical imaging, high-performance computing and numerical methods mean that computational models of electrical propagation in human heart tissue are ripe for use in patient-specific simulation for diagnosis, for prognosis and for selection of treatment methods. However, in order to move in this direction, it is necessary to make efficient use of modern petascale computing resources. This paper focuses on an existing open source simulation framework (Chaste) and documents work done to improve the parallel scaling on a small range of electrophysiology benchmark problems. These benchmarks involve the numerical solution of the monodomain or bidomain equations via the finite-element method. At the beginning of this study the electrophysiology libraries within Chaste were already enabled to run in parallel and were able to solve for electrical propagation using the monodomain or bidomain equations, but parallel efficiency dropped rapidly when run on more than about 64 processors. Throughout the course of the study, improvements were made to problem definition input; geometric mesh partitioning; finite-element assembly of large, sparse linear systems; problem-specific matrix preconditioning; numerical solution of the linear system; and output of the approximate solution. The consequence of these improvements is that, at the end of the study, Chaste is able to solve a monodomain benchmark problem in close to real time. While some of the improvements made to the parallel Chaste code are specific to cardiac electrophysiology, many of the techniques documented in this paper are generic to the parallel finite-element method in other scientific application areas.}

abstract = {Cancer is a complex disease characterized by a wide array of mutually interacting components constituting the tumor microenvironment (connective tissue, vascular system, immune cells), many of which are targeted therapeutically. In particular, immune checkpoint inhibitors have recently become an established part of the treatment of cancer. Despite great promise, only a portion of the patients display durable response. Current research efforts are concentrated on the determination of tumor-specific biomarkers predictive of response, such as tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, and neo-antigen presentation. However, it is clear that several additional characteristics pertaining to the tumor microenvironment play a critical role in the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Here we comment on the computational methods that are used for the analysis of the tumor microenvironment components from transcriptomic data, discuss the critical needs, and foresee potential evolutions in the field.}

abstract = {This article describes a study of educational outcomes for 0- to 8-year-old children with blindness and low vision (BLV) who are learning sonification concepts. Children with BLV experience barriers to accessing education and careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), fields which traditionally rely heavily on visual representation of information. There is growing awareness of the potential of sonification, a technology to represent data and information in non-speech audio, to improve education access. While early learning of assistive technology skills is deemed essential for equity of access to education across the curriculum, children are generally not introduced to the concept of sonification at school until at academic level in secondary or tertiary education. Little is known about how young children with BLV engage with this promising technology. First, ‘CosmoBally on Sonoplanet’ is introduced, an accessible, educational game application for iPads and Android tablets. Then findings are shared from an anonymous online survey that collected formal responses from users of this app, using a combination of Likert-type scale and open-ended questions. The majority of the 17 respondents were (specialist) educators, and five of the respondents identified as having BLV. The survey investigated respondents’ perceptions of the capabilities of young children with BLV in using basic sonification in ‘CosmoBally on Sonoplanet’ to identify shapes – including a circle – to orientate in a digital grid and to create drawings on a touch screen. Results suggest that young children with BLV can learn sonification skills and additionally may build relevant non-sonification skills during this learning process. This article aims to provide a first insight into best practice around early learning of sonification as a potential tool for increased access and inclusion of children with BLV to STEM subjects in school.}

abstract = {In this article, the implementation of the pitch-control option is described within the OpenFOAM computational fluid dynamics library supported by the preliminary results for a few representative test cases. The proposed pitch-control logic represents a simplified version of the typically model available for the load simulation based on blade element momentum theory codes. The control variable for the blade pitch regulation is the rotor rotational speed, for which an additional torque-speed controller determining the equilibrium between the aerodynamic and the electrical torque is required. The simulations are performed on the 80-m-diameter turbine used as a reference design within the SmartBlades project. The unsteady test cases are based on the assumption of rigid, not pre-bend blade, and refer to an emergency stop and an extreme operating gust. Results verified the correctness of the implemented control logic and its sensitivity to the control parameters, that is, the key factors for a successful regulation of power production and load mitigation in wind turbine design. The implemented simulation methodology constitutes the first step toward the reproduction of very complex operating conditions for wind turbines by means of accurate computations.}

abstract = {Background Septal deviation is an extremely common anatomic variation in healthy adults. However, there are no standard criteria to determine when a deviated septum is clinically relevant. Presently, selection of patients for septoplasty is based on mostly clinical examination, which is prone to observer bias and may lead to unsuccessful treatment. The objective of this article is twofold. First, we investigate whether the location of a septal deviation within the nasal passages affects nasal resistance. Second, we test whether computer simulations are consistent with rhinomanometry studies in predicting that anterior septal deviations increase nasal resistance more than posterior deviations. Methods A three-dimensional computational model of a healthy nose was created from computed tomography scans. Geometry-deforming software was used to produce models with septal deviations. Computational fluid dynamics techniques were used to simulate nasal airflow and compute nasal resistance. Results Our results revealed that the posterior nasal cavity can accommodate significant septal deviations without a substantial increase in airway resistance. In contrast, a deviation in the nasal valve region more than doubled nasal resistance. These findings are in good agreement with the rhinomanometry literature and with the observation that patients with anterior septal deviations benefit the most from septoplasty. Conclusions In the model, anterior septal deviations increased nasal resistance more than posterior deviations. This suggests, in agreement with the literature, that other causes of nasal obstruction (dysfunction of the nasal valve, allergy, etc.) should be carefully considered in patients with posterior septal deviations because such deviations may not affect nasal resistance. This study illustrates how computational modeling and virtual manipulation of the nasal geometry are useful to investigate nasal physiology.}

In doing so, this paper provides guidance to future leaders and innovators seeking to build computational and digital capabilities in complex clinical settings. Methods Interviews were undertaken with 42 participants associated with a large public hospital organisation within England’s National Health Service. Using the concept of institutional readiness as an analytical framework, the paper explores participants’ perspectives on the organisation’s capacity to support the development of, and benefit from, digital and computational approaches. Results Participants’ accounts reveal a range of specific institutional readiness criteria relating to organisational vision, technical capability, organisational agility, and talent and skills that, when met, enhance the organisations’ capacity to support the development and implementation of digital and computational tools. Participant accounts also reveal challenges relating to these criteria, such as unrealistic expectations and the necessary prioritisation of clinical work in resource-constrained settings. Conclusions The paper identifies a general set of institutional readiness criteria that can guide future hospital leaders and innovators aiming to improve their organisation’s digital and computational capability.

Many of these students did not have a good background in mathematics, fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and programming; however, most of them were good at computer‐aided design in ProE and were very interested in learning computational fluid dynamics as a design tool in industries. Solidworks flow simulator was chosen as the computational fluid dynamics software to teach students the entire computational fluid dynamics process in a single integrated software environment. Based on projects, computational fluid dynamics numerical methods and fundamentals of heat transfer and fluid flow were introduced to help students understand the computational fluid dynamics process, interpret, and validate simulation results. The computational fluid dynamics simulation of an orifice meter is given as the basic example for the students. Orifice meters are the most common equipment used for measuring fluid flow because of their simple mechanical structure, versatility, and low cost. In this paper, computational fluid dynamics simulation has been used to predict the orifice flow with better accuracy. Computational fluid dynamics simulations have been performed using solidworks flow simulator and validated with the data available in published literature. A new system has been proposed to accurately measure the flow using orifice metering systems.}

The first is the computational complexity required for pronoun resolution, as argued in L1 acquisition by Grodzinsky and Reinhart and L2 acquisition by Slabakova et al. The second is how pronoun interpretation operates in L1. The hypothesis is tested by comparing Korean and Spanish L2-English learners’ interpretation of English pronouns using a Truth Value Judgment Task. Both groups had difficulty rejecting pronouns with local-referential antecedents when their proficiency levels were low. Additionally, Korean speakers showed more non-target responses than Spanish speakers due to their knowledge of pronoun interpretation in Korean. These results indicate that both L1 transfer and processing difficulty may be sources of L2 learners’ non-target pronoun interpretation, supporting the hypothesis of the study.}

abstract = {Abstract Experimental studies using human volunteers are limited to low acceleration impacts while whole cadavers, isolated cervical spine specimens, and impact dummies do not normally reflect the true human response. Computational modelling offers a cost effective and useful alternative to experimental methods to study the behaviour of the human head and neck and their response to impacts to gain insight into injury mechanisms. This article reports the approach used in the development of a detailed multi-body computational model that reproduces the head and cervical spine of an adult in the upright posture representing the natural lordosis of the neck with mid-sagittal symmetry. The model comprises simplified but accurate representations of the nine rigid bodies representing the head, seven cervical vertebrae of the neck, and the first thoracic vertebra, as well as the soft tissues, i.e. muscles, ligaments, and intervertebral discs. The rigid bodies are interconnected by non-linear viscoelastic intervertebral discs elements in flexion and extension, non-linear viscoelastic ligaments and supported through frictionless facet joints. Eighteen muscle groups and 69 individual muscle segments of the head and neck on each side of the body are also included in the model. Curving the muscle around the vertebrae and soft tissues of the neck during the motion of the neck is also modelled. Simulation is handled by the multi-body dynamic software MSC.visuaNastran4D. Muscle mechanics is handled by an external application, Virtual Muscle, in conjunction with MSC.visuaNastran4D that provides realistic muscle properties. Intervertebral discs are modelled as non-linear viscoelastic material in flexion and extension but represented by ‘bushing elements’ in Visual Nastran 4D, which allows stiffness and damping properties to be assigned to a joint with required number of degrees of freedom of the motion. Ligaments are modelled as non-linear viscoelastic spring-damper elements. As the model is constructed, the cervical spine motion segments are validated by comparing the segment response to published experimental data on the load-displacement behaviour for both small and large static loads. The response of the entire ligamentous cervical spine model to quasi-static flexion and extension loading is also compared to experimental data to validate the model before the effect of muscle stiffening is included. Moreover the moment-generating capacity of the neck muscle elements has been compared against in vivo experimental data. The main and coupled motions of the model segments are shown to be accurate and realistic, and the whole model is in good agreement with experimental findings from actual human cervical spine specimens. It has been shown that the model can predict the loads and deformations of the individual soft-tissue elements making the model suitable for injury analysis. The validation of the muscle elements shows the morphometric values, origins, and insertions selected to be reasonable. The muscles can be activated as required, providing a more realistic representation of the human head and neck. The curved musculature results in a more realistic representation of the change in muscle length during the head and neck motion.}

abstract = {Continuous requirements for more efficient aircrafts lead to the design and analysis of novel propulsion configurations, with an example being the boundary layer ingestion. The complexity and integration challenges in such aircraft synergistic propulsion system characterize the research in this field, driven by the potential benefits. The aim of this article is to investigate the effects of boundary layer ingestion on the aerodynamics of a transonic wing, together with the quality of the flow ingested by the propulsion system. A two-dimensional computational model of a transonic airfoil with boundary layer ingesting propulsion system is developed in order to assess boundary layer ingestion for a commercial air transport at cruise conditions and highlight the complex integration issues arising from such configuration. A parametric analysis of the effects of flight conditions, nacelle geometry and engine operating point, on lift, pressure recovery, distortion, total pressure and velocity distribution at the intake, comes to enhance understanding of the performance of this configuration. The pressure distribution around the airfoil and the boundary layer growth are both substantially affected by the engine operating condition, which is represented by the mass flow ratio, with a direct impact on pressure recovery and lift. Mach number and angle of attack influences on lift and drag ingested are also investigated. Intake size and position on the airfoil appear to have significant effects on lift and losses ingested. In general, the results of this study include several aspects related to wing aerodynamics and ingested flow quality, which may facilitate design and integration of the boundary layer ingestion propulsion system for future commercial aircraft.}

abstract = {Background Nasal adhesions (NAs) are a known complication of nasal airway surgery. Even minor NAs can lead to significant postoperative nasal airway obstruction (NAO). Division of such NAs often provides much greater relief than anticipated. Objective We examine the impact of NAs at various anatomical sites on nasal airflow and mucosal cooling using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and multiple test subjects. Methods CT scans of healthy adult subjects were used to construct three-dimensional nasal airway computational models. A single virtual 2.5 mm diameter NA was placed at one of five sites commonly seen following NAO surgery within each nasal cavity bilaterally, resulting in 10 NA models and 1 NA-free control for each subject. CFD analysis was performed on each NA model and compared with the subject’s NA-free control model. Results 4 subjects were recruited to create 44 computational models. The NAs caused the airflow streamlines to separate, leading to a statistically significant increase in mucosal temperature immediately downstream to the NAs (wake region). Changes in the mucosal temperature in the wake region of the NAs were most prominent in anteriorly located NAs with a mean increase of 1.62 °C for the anterior inferior turbinate NAs (P < .001) and 0.63 °C for the internal valve NAs (P < .001). Conclusion NAs result in marked disruption to airflow patterns and reduced mucosal cooling on critical surfaces, particularly in the wake region. Reduced wake region mucosal cooling may be a contributing factor to the exaggerated perception of nasal obstruction experienced by patients with NAs.}

abstract = {There is considerable controversy surrounding the study of presidential debates, particularly efforts to connect their content and impact. Research has long debated whether the citizenry reacts to what candidates say, how they say it, or simply how they appear. This study uses detailed coding of the first 2012 debate between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney to test the relative influence of the candidates’ verbal persuasiveness and nonverbal features on viewers’ “second screen” behavior—their use of computers, tablets, and mobile phones to enhance or extend the televised viewing experience. To examine these relationships, we merged two datasets: (1) a shot-by-shot content analysis coded for functional, tonal, and visual elements of both candidates’ communication behavior during the debate; and (2) corresponding real-time measures, synched and lagged, of the volume and sentiment of Twitter expression about Obama and Romney. We find the candidates’ facial expressions and physical gestures to be more consistent and robust predictors of the volume and valence of Twitter expression than candidates’ persuasive strategies, verbal utterances, and voice tone during the debate.}

abstract = {We present results obtained with new instrumental methods for the acoustic analysis of prosody to evaluate prosody production by children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Typical Development (TD). Two tasks elicit focal stress — one in a vocal imitation paradigm, the other in a picture-description paradigm; a third task also uses a vocal imitation paradigm, and requires repeating stress patterns of two-syllable nonsense words. The instrumental methods differentiated significantly between the ASD and TD groups in all but the focal stress imitation task. The methods also showed smaller differences in the two vocal imitation tasks than in the picture-description task, as was predicted. In fact, in the nonsense word stress repetition task, the instrumental methods showed better performance for the ASD group. The methods also revealed that the acoustic features that predict auditory-perceptual judgment are not the same as those that differentiate between groups. Specifically, a key difference between the groups appears to be a difference in the balance between the various prosodic cues, such as pitch, amplitude, and duration, and not necessarily a difference in the strength or clarity with which prosodic contrasts are expressed.}

abstract = {Flow coefficient is an important performance index associated with the energy efficiency of a valve, and an effective method to evaluate valve flow coefficient is necessary for valve industry. However, theoretical estimation often results in poor accuracy, while experimental measurements involve significant costs in time and equipment. In this article, a computational fluid dynamics method is proposed to achieve simple and accurate evaluation of valve flow coefficient. For each valve, a computational fluid dynamics model is established containing a valve section, an upstream section, and a downstream section. A grid-adaptation strategy is then applied to improve the accuracy of simulation. To calculate flow coefficient, the most important issue is to determine the net pressure loss induced by valve (ΔPv). Herein, the overall pressure drop (ΔPo) is obtained first, and the pipe-induced pressure drop (ΔPp) is estimated by linear fitting. Then, ΔPv is calculated as the difference between ΔPo and ΔPp. To ensure accurate estimation of the pressure losses, a length of 26 times of pipe diameter is preferred for the upstream section. The experiments demonstrated that the presented method can accurately predict flow coefficient for various types of valves and thus has great potential to be widely used in the valve industry.}
