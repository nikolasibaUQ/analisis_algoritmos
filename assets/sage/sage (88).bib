abstract = {In this industrial age, skills required in most jobs are 21st-century skills. The current study aimed to investigate whether there is a relationship between implementing project-based collaborative learning using PowerPoint and improving students’ 21st-century skills from the students’ perspectives. It also examines whether there is a significant relationship between students’ attitudes toward learning collaboratively using PowerPoint to improve their 21st-century skills and their major. The participants of the study were 75 female students enrolled in an Educational Technology and Means course at Najran University. The findings revealed that there is a significant and positive relationship between implementing a project-based collaborative learning approach using PowerPoint and improving the students’ 21st-century skills, r (74) = 0.74 and p < 0.05. Additionally, the findings demonstrated that 21st-century skills improved the most through “actively collaborating with others” (M = 4.6, SD = 0.56). Additionally, there was no significant difference in students’ attitudes toward learning collaboratively using PowerPoint to improve their 21st-century skills in terms of human studies or scientific studies majors, t (37) = 1.97 and p > 0.05. The findings demonstrate that more research is required on the role of higher education in developing meaningful technology-based strategies to improve students’ 21st-century skills in learning environments.}

abstract = {This study was aimed at evaluating the artificial neural network (ANN), genetic algorithm (GA), adaptive neurofuzzy interference (ANFIS), and the response surface methodology (RSM) approaches for modeling and optimizing the simultaneous adsorptive removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) in produced water (PW) using tea waste biochar (TWBC). Comparative analysis of RSM, ANN, and ANFIS models showed mean square error (MSE) as 5.29809, 1.49937, and 0.24164 for adsorption of COD and MSE of 0.11726, 0.10241, and 0.08747 for prediction of TOC adsorption, respectively. The study showed that ANFIS outperformed the ANN and RSM in terms of fast convergence, minimum MSE, and sum of square error for prediction of adsorption data. The adsorption parameters were optimized using ANFIS-surface plots, ANN-GA hybrid, RSM-GA hybrid, and RSM optimization tool in design expert (DE) software. Maximum COD (88.9%) and TOC (98.8%) removal were predicted at pH of 7, a dosage of 300 mg/L, and contact time of 60 mins using ANFIS-surface plots. The optimization approaches showed the performance in the following order: ANFIS-surface plots>ANN-GA>RSM-GA>RSM.}

abstract = {It has been hypothesized that the muscular efforts exerted during standing may be altered by changes in personal factors, such as the body stature and muscular strength. The goal of this work was to assess the contribution of leg muscles using a biomechanical model in different physical conditions and various initial postures. An optimized inverse dynamics model was employed to find the maximum muscular effort in 23,040 postures. The simulation results showed that mid-range knee flexion could help the healthy and strong individuals maintain balance, but those with weaker muscle strength required more knee flexion. Individuals of weak muscular constitution as well as those with tall stature are at the highest risk of imbalance/falling. The number of imbalanced postures due to deficits in the calf and hamstring muscles was reduced by 7.5 times by strengthening the whole body musculature. The calf and the hamstring muscles play a key role in balance regardless of stature.}

abstract = {The critical research agenda on smart cities has tended to assume a largely top-down orientation in which powerful actors like the state and corporations enact programmes to embed Information & Communication Technologies (ICT) in the urban landscape. Because of the way research has framed this relation of power, the dominant response has been to seek social justice by either contesting these top-down exercises of (digital) power or by reconceptualising the smart city ‘from below’. In this paper, we join a growing chorus of voices recognising the importance of interstitial actors that influence the ways in which the smart city manifests. We draw on a five-year ongoing study in Calgary, Alberta, to examine two actor groups that are, properly, neither top-down nor bottom-up, but play an important role in envisioning, implementing and contesting how ‘smartness’ is framed. The first set of actors, situated between the top and bottom of the smart city hierarchy, are most prominently community associations, non-profit organisations and ad-hoc task groups. The second group is comprised of groups with different digital practices, whose spectre of marginalisation influences how digital systems are articulated and pursued. These actors strategically move between different interstices in order to enact particular kinds of political influence, and often influence smart cities by virtue of their absence, profoundly impacting urban political geographies of smartness.}

abstract = {Background: The development of therapeutic agents against Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has stalled recently. Drug candidates targeting amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition have often failed clinical trials at different stages, prompting the search for novel targets for AD therapy. The NLRP3 inflammasome is an integral part of innate immunity, contributing to neuroinflammation and AD pathophysiology. Thus, it has become a promising new target for AD therapy. Objective: The study sought to investigate the potential of bioactive compounds derived from Azadirachta-indica to inhibit the NLRP3 protein implicated in the pathophysiology of AD. Methods: Structural bioinformatics via molecular docking and density functional theory (DFT) analysis was utilized for the identification of novel NLRP3 inhibitors from A. indica bioactive compounds. The compounds were further subjected to pharmacokinetic and drug-likeness analysis. Results obtained from the compounds were compared against that of oridonin, a known NLRP3 inhibitor. Results: The studied compounds optimally saturated the binding site of the NLRP3 NACHT domain, forming principal interactions with the different amino acids at its binding site. The studied compounds also demonstrated better bioactivity and chemical reactivity as ascertained by DFT analysis and all the compounds except 7-desacetyl-7-benzoylazadiradione, which had two violations, conformed to Lipinski’s rule of five. Conclusion: In silico studies show that A. indica derived compounds have better inhibitory potential against NLRP3 and better pharmacokinetic profiles when compared with the reference ligand (oridonin). These compounds are thus proposed as novel NLRP3 inhibitors for the treatment of AD. Further wet-lab studies are needed to confirm the potency of the studied compounds.}

The contribution of the research concerns methods to map influence and sensitivity that provide valuable and complementary information on space for decision making in territorial planning. We also discuss the center properties according to the primary objectives of equity, equality, and efficacy in the access to a facility. In a spatial-thinking approach, we present some methodological propositions to obtain robust and durable centers in geographical space, that rely on the adaptation of the general frame of the Lp norm to the planning objectives.}

The NeuroData Tracker platform has been developed for the objective and precise evaluation of hand motor deficits. We describe the design and development of the platform and analyse the technological feasibility and usability in a relevant clinical setting. Methods A software application was developed in Unity (C#) to obtain kinematic data from hand movement tracking by a portable device with two cameras and three infrared sensors (leap motion®). Four exercises were implemented: (a) wrist flexion-extension (b) finger-grip opening-closing (c) finger spread (d) fist opening-closing. The most representative kinematic parameters were selected for each exercise. A script in Python was integrated in the platform to transform real-time kinematic data into relevant information for the clinician. The application was tested in a pilot study comparing the data provided by the tool from ten healthy subjects without any motor impairment and ten patients diagnosed with a stroke with mild to moderate hand motor deficit. Results The NeuroData Tracker allowed the parameterization of kinematics of hand movement and the issuance of a report with the results. The comparison of the data obtained suggests the feasibility of the tool for detecting differences between patients and healthy subjects. Conclusions This new platform based on optical motion capturing provides objective measurement of hand movement allowing quantification of motor deficits. These findings require further validation of the tool in larger trials to verify its usefulness in the clinical setting.}

abstract = {Introduction: In an effort to combat SARS-CoV-2 through multi-subunit vaccine design, during studies using whole genome and immunome, ORF10, located at the 3′ end of the genome, displayed unique features. It showed no homology to any known protein in other organisms, including SARS-CoV. It was observed that its nucleotide sequence is 100% identical in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes sourced worldwide, even in the recent-most VoCs and VoIs of B.1.1.529 (Omicron), B.1.617 (Delta), B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), and P.1 (Gamma) lineages, implicating its constant nature throughout the evolution of deadly variants. Aim: The structure and function of SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 and the role it may play in the viral evolution is yet to be understood clearly. The aim of this study is to predict its structure, function, and understand evolutionary dynamics on the basis of mutations and likely heightened immune responses in the immunopathogenesis of this deadly virus. Methods: Sequence analysis, ab-initio structure modeling and an understanding of the impact of likely substitutions in key regions of protein was carried out. Analyses of viral T cell epitopes and primary anchor residue mutations was done to understand the role it may play in the evolution as a molecule with likely enhanced immune response and consequent immunopathogenesis. Results: Few amino acid substitution mutations are observed, most probably due to the ribosomal frameshifting, and these mutations may not be detrimental to its functioning. As ORF10 is observed to be an expressed protein, ab-initio structure modeling shows that it comprises mainly an α-helical region and maybe an ER-targeted membrane mini-protein. Analyzing the whole proteome, it is observed that ORF10 presents amongst the highest number of likely promiscuous and immunogenic CTL epitopes, specifically 11 out of 30 promiscuous ones and 9 out of these 11, immunogenic CTL epitopes. Reactive T cells to these epitopes have been uncovered in independent studies. Majority of these epitopes are located on the α-helix region of its structure, and the substitution mutations of primary anchor residues in these epitopes do not affect immunogenicity. Its conserved nucleotide sequence throughout the evolution and diversification of virus into several variants is a puzzle yet to be solved. Conclusions: On the basis of its sequence, structure, and epitope mapping, it is concluded that it may function like those mini-proteins used to boost immune responses in medical applications. Due to the complete nucleotide sequence conservation even a few years after SARS-CoV-2 genome was first sequenced, it poses a unique puzzle to be solved, in view of the evolutionary dynamics of variants emerging in the populations worldwide.}

abstract = {Heat affected zone on the micromachined material, a hindrance in achieving good precision and accuracy, which are adequate requirements for micromachined materials, is a drawback of nanosecond micromachining assisted by laser. The primary objective of this paper is to take into consideration a number of input parameters, such as the pulse width and the temperature of the laser beam, and study the effect that these parameters have on the heat flux generated as well as on the temperature distribution along the square grooves of 200 µm width and depth that are to be micro-machined on an alumina ceramic workpiece. However, processing of alumina ceramic on a micron-scale requires careful consideration to raise the quality standard. This will be accomplished by analyzing the data collected from the micro-machining process. Using the ANSYS® software, it is possible to visualize not only the region where heat is generated but also the way in which the input parameters influence the structural qualities of the micro machined groove surface. The many thermal models that have been constructed have revealed specific changes in the structural qualities that have had a significant impact on the upper width, the lower width, and the depth of the groove when applied to a variety of different parametric settings. Finally, developed analytical model is compared with the experimental models. The highest prediction error was found to be 1.68%, while, for constant 50 W power and 150–250 mm/s of speed, the average prediction error was determined to be 1.18%. As a result, the proposed model closely matches the experimental findings, and the proposed model can be used to estimate channel profile.}

Common strategies communicate the skills and knowledge needed to reflect while providing practice opportunities. Yet research indicates that reflective habits are comprised of not only skills and knowledge but also of attitudes toward reflection. This study investigated whether attitudinal change strategies in a reflective thinking workshop induced cognitive dissonance by helping adults appreciate reflection and calibrate their reflective behavior. Participants were randomly assigned to a skills-based or skills-based plus attitudinal change workshop. Pre-post measures of learners’ need for and engagement in reflection were taken. Multivariate analysis of covariance revealed that attitudinal change strategies induced dissonance by increasing the need for reflection while decreasing perceived engagement in reflection. Exclusively skills-based strategies failed to affect the need for reflection but increased perceived engagement in reflection, creating overconfidence. Implications for research and practice are offered.}

abstract = {Carbon nanofiller–modified polymers have been the subject of intense study for years due to their potential use in diverse and far-reaching applications. The effect of nanofiller network parameters on macroscale direct current electrical transport has been thoroughly elucidated by extensive nano-to-microscale modeling. As a result, we now have great insight into how the conductive and piezoresistive properties of nanocomposites can be tailored through judicious control of the underlying nanofiller network. It is also well-known that carbon nanofiller–modified polymers possess frequency-dependent alternating current electrical properties. Even though work has been done to understand the alternating current properties of nanocomposites via experimental characterization and through the development of macroscale equivalent circuit models, much less has been done to understand how macroscale alternating current conductivity depends on microscale effects such as nanofiller alignment and aspect ratio. This is an important knowledge gap because, like direct current conductivity, the underlying nanofiller network ultimately gives rise to macroscale alternating current transport in these materials. To this end, we herein present an alternating current microscale percolation model for carbon filler–based polymer nanocomposites. After calibration against experimental complex impedance data from randomly ordered carbon nanofiber–modified epoxy, this model is used to explore the effect of carbon nanofiber alignment and aspect ratio on alternating current conductivity. These simulations show that alternating current conductivity generally increases with increasing alignment and with aspect ratio; however, the competing effects of alternating current and direct current percolation give rise to substantial variation in alternating current conductivity at low frequencies and with poor percolation. The methodology presented in this article provides a modeling tool by which nanocomposites with highly optimized alternating current properties can be developed through careful control and tailoring of nanofiller network properties for the realization of exotic, next-generation material functionality.}

abstract = {This paper investigates the effects of clustering on the effective transverse thermal conductivity of unidirectional cement composites filled with natural hemp fibers. A typical clustering pattern with four hemp fibers embedded into cement matrix is designed as the representative two-dimensional unit cell, which is taken from the periodic cement composite under consideration, and a clustering degree parameter is introduced to adjust the distance between clustered fibers. For this heterogeneous two-component composite model, distributions of the heat flux component are obtained using finite element simulation for various clustering cases involving different global fiber volume concentrations, clustering degree parameters, and thermal conductivity of both fiber and matrix, to evaluate the effective thermal conductivity of the composite. To further reveal the effects caused by clustered fibers, a random cluster pattern of hemp fibers in the unit cell is considered for comparison with the present regular clustering pattern. Further, a simple theoretical model with specified flexible factor f is developed by matching the theoretical and numerical predictions.}

abstract = {Urban building energy modelling (UBEM) is a prevalent research method to examine the multi-scale building to urban renovation in mitigating global energy-related carbon emissions. However, only a few studies delineate a complete workflow from generation to application using UBEM. In particular, to facilitate the designing of sustainable built environments, existing research needs to emphasize the integration of multi-scale energy performance evaluation within the design development process for architects and urban planners. The key challenges lie in the need for integrated datasets and incompatibility between software tools required for designing, modelling, and evaluation. This paper presents a comprehensive methodological framework to investigate applicable urban decarbonization strategies. A case study of Sheffield in the UK demonstrates the development of an automated and standardized computational workflow. This data-driven workflow aims to evaluate energy demand and supply scenarios at an urban scale to access the potential of decarbonizing built environments. The workflow is designed to be adaptable to various scales of urban regions, given a suitable geographic information system (GIS) dataset.}
