abstract = {Multidimensional computational analysis of fluid flow is usually done by segmented iterative methods, as the equations sets generated are too large to permit simultaneous solution. Frequently the need arises to compute values for variables which must remain bounded for physical reasons. In two-phase computation, for example, the volume fraction is restricted to values between 0 and 1, but iterative procedures often return intermediate values which violate these bounds. It is fairly straightforward to prevent negative values, however no satisfactory method of imposing the upper limit has been published. A method of smoothly applying the limit in reversible fashion is outlined in this note.}

abstract = {Learning the basic concepts of programming and its foundations is considered as a challenging task for students to figure out. It is a challenging process for lecturers to learn these concepts, as well. The current literature on programming training abounds with the examples of a wide range of methods employed. Within this context, one of the prominent approaches in programming training is flipped classroom (FC) model. This article has sought to illuminate the effect of cognitive flexibility, problem-solving skills (PSS), and flipped learning readiness (FLR) levels on students’ programming achievements in programming training through FC model. A total of 149 freshmen computer science students studying in a state university in Turkey were recruited for this study. In this study, designed as a relational screening model, a personal form, an achievement test, and three different data collection instruments were employed to collect data. For the data analysis, structural equation modeling, a multivariate statistical analysis technique, was used to reveal a model explaining and predicting the relations between programming achievement and different variables. The findings clearly indicate that FLR is the most important predictor of the programming achievements of students in FC. Other important predictors were found as PSS and cognitive flexibility. The research model demonstrates that an increase or development in FLR, PSS, and cognitive flexibility levels in FC will enhance the achievements of students in programming.}

Landmark projects over the past century introduced various classification systems and initiated important debates within the field. From the author’s perspective, classification of data is understood as a necessary precursor to computation in these projects. Classificatory thinking is used here as a theme to explore debates that have arisen when abstractions of musical practice have been suggested for use with ethnomusicology. The paper proposes that a recent approach to research practice for embedding computation adds to ongoing interdisciplinary work, demonstrating novel ways of contextualizing archival materials with ethnography alongside computation. The approach attempted to strike a balance for engaging large amounts of data in ethnomusicology. The paper argues that some resulting tensions arising from classification lead to insights, which cannot be drawn by ethnomusicological methods alone.}

abstract = {An electrically conducting and magnetically influenced three-dimensional flow of modified nanofluid between two rotating disks is investigated in this study. Nanometer-size particles of two distinct materials (Al2O3, Ag) suspended in water in the hybrid nanofluid are considered. The Joule heating effects, mixed convection, chemical factor, and exponential heating are considered in this study. The physical problem under these assumptions is transformed into a system of equations. To convert partial differential equations (PDEs) into systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), the suitable similarity variables are introduced. The reduced system is numerically solved using bvp4c, a well-known higher-order algorithm. The effects of significant variables on the profiles of velocity, temperature, and concentration are depicted graphically. We have chosen the pertinent parameters in the specific intervals; , and . The interactions between a number of significant factors, including skin friction and Nusselt and Sherwood numbers at the higher and lower disks, are shown in tables. The results demonstrate that the local skin fraction decreases as the mixed convection factor is increased, which physically increases the heat transmission rate between the two discs. Furthermore, as the magnetic field and radiation number rise, the rate of heat transfer at the lower and top discs decreases. The numerical results in the form of a table are compared with the available literature, and our results beat the previously published work. The results described here are desirable choices for thermal uses such as automotive cooling systems, solar thermal systems, engineering, medical areas, heat sinks, or current energy storage since they have demonstrated higher thermal characteristics and stability than simple nanofluids (NFs). In Table 6, a comparative numerical study is presented for the various of state variables with the available literature, where the present study is validated.}

abstract = {This study investigated a method for conducting experimental analyses of academic responding. In the experimental analyses, academic responding (math computation), rather than problem behavior, was reinforced across conditions. Two separate experimental analyses (one with fluent math computation problems and one with non-fluent math computation problems) were conducted with three elementary school children using identical contingencies while math computation rate was measured. Results indicate that the experimental analysis with non-fluent problems produced undifferentiated responding across participants; however, differentiated responding was achieved for all participants in the experimental analysis with fluent problems. A subsequent comparison of the single-most effective condition from the experimental analyses replicated the findings with novel computation problems. Results are discussed in terms of the critical role of stimulus control in identifying controlling consequences for academic deficits, and recommendations for future research refining and extending experimental analysis to academic responding are made.}

It thereby investigates to what degree the news coverage and politicians’ self-depiction employs visual gender stereotypes. Moreover, the study presents results on differences in the depiction of male and female candidates across party lines. With the help of computational vision, we demonstrate that, while differences between progressive and conservative candidates are scarce, there are clear differences in the depiction of female and male politicians. These differences resemble emotional gender stereotypes, especially since women are more often depicted as happy. Overall, the study demonstrates that female political communication is still distinct from male political communication for both their self-representation as well as the media’s portrayal of political candidates.}

The cooperation between Stata and Maxima provides an environment for statistical analysis in which symbolic computation can be easily used together with all the facilities supplied by Stata. In this environment, symbolic computation algorithms can be used to manage the complexity of algebra and calculus, whereas numerical computation can be used when speed matters.

These chatbots differ from existing tools both in function and form. First, they target misinformation and enhance the identification of fallacious arguments; and second, they are multiagent and leverage discourse theories of persuasion in their conversational design. After having described both their backend and their frontend design, we report on the evaluation of the user interface and impact on users’ critical thinking skills through a questionnaire, a crowdsourced survey, and a pilot qualitative experiment. The results shed light on the best practices to design user-friendly active inoculation tools and reveal that the two chatbots are perceived as increasing critical thinking skills in the current misinformation ecosystem.}

abstract = {Cycle-to-cycle variations are important to consider in the development of spark-ignition engines to further increase fuel conversion efficiency. Direct numerical simulation and large eddy simulation can predict the stochastics of flows and therefore cycle-to-cycle variations. However, the computational costs are too high for engineering purposes if detailed chemistry is applied. Detailed chemistry can predict the fuels’ tendency to auto-ignite for different octane ratings as well as locally changing thermodynamic and chemical conditions which is a prerequisite for the analysis of knocking combustion. In this work, the joint use of unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations for the analysis of the average engine cycle and the spark-ignition stochastic reactor model for the analysis of cycle-to-cycle variations is proposed. Thanks to the stochastic approach for the modeling of mixing and heat transfer, the spark-ignition stochastic reactor model can mimic the randomness of turbulent flows that is missing in the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes modeling framework. The capability to predict cycle-to-cycle variations by the spark-ignition stochastic reactor model is extended by imposing two probability density functions. The probability density function for the scalar mixing time constant introduces a variation in the turbulent mixing time that is extracted from the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations and leads to variations in the overall mixing process. The probability density function for the inflammation time accounts for the delay or advancement of the early flame development. The combination of unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and spark-ignition stochastic reactor model enables one to predict cycle-to-cycle variations using detailed chemistry in a fraction of computational time needed for a single large eddy simulation cycle.}

Analyses reveal that Christians use more positive emotion words and less negative emotion words than atheists. Moreover, two independent paths predict differences in expressions of happiness: frequency of words related to an intuitive (vs. analytic) thinking style and frequency of words related to social relationships. These findings provide the first evidence that the relationship between religion and happiness is partially mediated by thinking style. This research also provides support for previous laboratory studies and self-report data, suggesting that social connection partially mediates the relationship between religiosity and happiness. Implications for theory and the future of social science using computational methods to analyze social media are discussed.}

The global trajectory is defined by a general flight intent, considering flight segments usually flown by transport aircraft, including standard airline procedures, and air traffic control regulations. The computation is based on a trajectory computation solver designed for a general aircraft performance model (general drag polar and general engine model); the formulation takes into account wind effects and temperature corrections for a non-standard atmosphere. In the computation of the global trajectory, the top-of-descent point is determined iteratively, using the actual aircraft weight computed along the flight. Global properties such as total fuel consumption and flight time are computed; the influence of the actual take-off weight is analysed, as well as the effects of wind and non-standard temperatures. The computation tool provides a quantitative evaluation of these effects. Results are presented for a medium-range global trajectory and a model of a typical twin-engine, wide-body and, transport aircraft.}

abstract = {Purpose: Purpose of this report is to describe the feasibility of lingual pulse oximetry and lingual near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in a COVID-19 patient to assess lingual tissue viability after several days of mechanical ventilation in the prone position. Materials & Methods: In a COVID-19 ICU-patient, the tongue became grotesquely swollen, hardened and protruding from the oral cavity after 20 h of mechanical ventilation uninterrupted in the prone position. To assess the doubtful viability of the tongue, pulse-oximetric hemoglobin O2-saturation (SpO2; Nellcor, OxiMax MAX-NI, Covidien, MA, USA) and NIRS-based, regional tissue O2-saturation measurements (rSO2; SenSmart, Nonin, MN, USA) were performed at the tongue. Results: At the tongue, regular pulse-oximetric waveforms with a pulse-oximetric hemoglobin O2-saturation (SpO2) of 88% were recorded, i.e. only slightly lower than the SpO2 reading at the extremities at that time (90%). Lingual NIRS-based rSO2 measurements yielded stable tissue rSO2-values of 76-78%, i.e. values expected also in other adequately perfused and oxygenated (muscle-) tissues. Conclusion: Despite the alarming, clinical finding of a grotesquely swollen, rubber-hard tongue and clinical concerns on the adequacy of the tongue perfusion and oxygenation, our measurements of both arterial pulsatility (SpO2) and NIRS-based tissue oxygenation (rSO2) suggested adequate perfusion and oxygenation of the tongue, rendering non-vitality of the tongue, e.g. by lingual venous thrombosis, unlikely. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical report of lingual rSO2 measurement.}

These three instantiations of contemporary secrecy are framed by a discussion of Julian Assange of WikiLeaks and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook – truly a couple for our age: each intent, in their own way, upon bringing an end to secrets. Throughout, we try to maintain close attention to the emerging rhythms and dissonances that engage secrecy in a dance between the half-voluntary and the half-enforced.}

For this purpose, we leverage a dual-methodological approach. First, to assess SHAP’s capabilities in uncovering patterns that shape a phenomenon, we conduct a Monte-Carlo simulation study. Second, to illustrate and guide the theory development process with SHAP for CTD, we apply SHAP in a use-case using real-world data. Based on these analyses, we propose a stepwise uniform and replicable approach giving guidance that can benefit rigorous theory development and increase the traceability of the theorizing process. With our structured approach we contribute to the use of XAI approaches in research and, by uncovering patterns in black-box prediction models, add to the ongoing search for next-generation theorizing methods in the field of Information Systems (IS).}

abstract = {Since many off-the-shelf motor drives are supplied with complete control capability in the current, velocity and position loop, the robot model in the navigation control architecture can be oriented either to kinematics, interfaced with the velocity loop, or to dynamics, with the motor-current loop. Moreover, no constraints are imposed by a caster on the mobility of differential-driving mobile robots. Hence, a reduced model, containing only the platform, is sufficient for navigation control based only on the robot kinematics. However, if the multibody system model is used for navigation control based on the robot dynamics, to cope with the demands of high-speed manoeuvres and/or heavy-load operations, then the caster kinematics, especially the knowledge of the steering angle, is required to calculate the inertia matrix and the terms of Coriolis and centrifugal forces. While this angle can be measured by means of dedicated encoders to be installed for casters, the computation technique based on the existing tachometers, already mounted on the motor shafts for the servo control of the two driving wheels, is proved to be sufficient. Both a thorough kinematics model and a multibody dynamics model, including the platform and all different wheels, are formulated here for differential-driving mobile robots. Computational methods based on velocity compatibility and rigid body twists are proposed to estimate the steering angle. Simulation results of the differential-driving mobile robot moving on a smooth trajectory show the feasibility of the steering-angle computational scheme, which obviates the need of installing caster encoders. Moreover, a performance comparison on system modelling is implemented via simulation, between the differential-driving mobile robot model with and without caster dynamics. This further validates the importance of the dynamic effects of casters on the whole system model. Therefore, the multibody modelling approach for casters with the steering-angle computation technique can facilitate the navigation control architecture under dynamics conditions.}
