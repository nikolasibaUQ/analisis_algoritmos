abstract = {With the development of the 4th Industrial Revolution (4th IR), its emerging technologies and skills; there is a mismatch between 4th IR, and the skills needed by information professionals to survive. This paper bridges the gap based on the skills needed to survive and provide possible solutions to challenges faced by information professionals, which will in turn help to reduce the number of unemployed, semi-employed, non-employed, and provide economic empowerment among information professionals in this new revolution. Information professionals should adopt the missing middle model/techniques in organization which asserts that robots, by and large, will not be taking our jobs; instead, human Machine collaboration will reconfigure some of our work, making and make human skills more unique and important than ever.}

abstract = {Psychiatric research is undergoing significant advances in an emerging subspeciality of computational psychiatry, building on cognitive neuroscience research by expanding to neurocomputational modeling. Here, we illustrate some research trends in this domain using work on proactive cognitive control deficits in schizophrenia as an example. We provide a selective review of formal modeling approaches to understanding cognitive control deficits in psychopathology, focusing primarily on biologically plausible connectionist-level models as well as mathematical models that generate parameter estimates of putatively dissociable psychological or neural processes. We illustrate some of the advantages of these models in terms of understanding both cognitive control deficits in schizophrenia and the potential roles of effort and motivation. Further, we highlight critical future directions for this work, including a focus on establishing psychometric properties, additional work modeling psychotic symptoms and their interaction with cognitive control, and the need to expand both behavioral and neural modeling to samples that include individuals with different mental health conditions, allowing for the examination of dissociable neural or psychological substrates for seemingly similar cognitive impairments across disorders.}

abstract = {Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) etiopathogenesis remains partially unexplained. The main conceptual framework used to study AD is the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis, although the failure of recent clinical experimentation seems to reduce its potential in AD research. Objective: A possible explanation for the failure of clinical trials is that they are set too late in AD progression. Recent studies suggest that the ventral tegmental area (VTA) degeneration could be one of the first events occurring in AD progression (pre-plaque stage). Methods: Here we investigate this hypothesis through a computational model and computer simulations validated with behavioral and neural data from patients. Results: We show that VTA degeneration might lead to system-level adjustments of catecholamine release, triggering a sequence of events leading to relevant clinical and pathological signs of AD. These changes consist first in a midfrontal-driven compensatory hyperactivation of both VTA and locus coeruleus (norepinephrine) followed, with the progression of the VTA impairment, by a downregulation of catecholamine release. These processes could then trigger the neural degeneration at the cortical and hippocampal levels, due to the chronic loss of the neuroprotective role of norepinephrine. Conclusion: Our novel hypothesis might contribute to the formulation of a wider system-level view of AD which might help to devise early diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.}

An algebraic thinking test was administered to 803 students aged 10–13 years old. One hundred and one students of different performance outcomes in the algebraic thinking test participated in semi-structured clinical interviews in order to develop further insights into students’ strategies and difficulties. The results confirmed the multifaceted nature of algebraic thinking and showed that algebraic thinking consists of three aspects: reasoning about covariation, generalization of arithmetic properties and abilities directly related to algebraic syntax. Each one of these aspects is composed of specific algebraic thinking abilities, such as modelling relations using algebraic symbols. Four groups of students of different algebraic thinking profiles were identified: ‘pre-algebraic’, ‘protoalgebraic-procedural’, ‘relational-symbolic algebraic thinking’ and ‘structural-global algebraic thinking’. The results also supported the presence of a consistent trend in the difficulty level across the algebraic thinking abilities, which suggests a specific developmental trend from a more procedural perspective of algebraic thinking to a more structural one.}

Employing a combination of analytic calculations, alongside tools such as Google Perspective and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), this article assesses the quality of online deliberative discourse using established measures of deliberation including the variables rationality, interactivity, equality, and civility. We propose computational approaches to measuring these variables, and work toward validating our approach by observing correlations between an established computational measure of online deliberation-cognitive complexity. This computational approach is tested using Twitter and Reddit commentary related to the convoy protests that took place in Ottawa, Canada, during February 2022, which influenced the emergence of similar protests around the world. In addition to testing our proposed online deliberative discourse measurement framework, this case study provides insight into the deliberative characteristics of the Twitter and Reddit social media platforms.}

abstract = {The complex nature of the tire/road noise generation process makes it difficult to isolate and study each mechanism individually. This paper presents an experimental and numerical investigation of air-borne tire noise generation mechanisms for a realistic tire. Experimentally, a single slot is cut into the tire and the noise data are measured and studied. Air-borne noise is isolated by filling the slot with foam and comparing the resulting frequency spectra. Numerically, a previously developed computational fluid dynamics tire noise prediction model is employed to predict the air-borne noise for the same tire, under similar operating conditions. A direct comparison between the experimental and computational results is also presented in terms of pressure time traces and spectral characteristics. Comparisons indicate that the computational model is capable of predicting the noise generated by the air pockets in the tire. While providing a deeper understanding of the causes of air-borne noise, this paper also aims to demonstrate the use of a computational tool that can be used to obtain a reasonably accurate prediction of air-borne tire noise.}

abstract = {During the last few years a growing amount of content produced by Internet users has become publicly available online. These data come from a variety of places, including popular social web services like Facebook and Twitter, consumer services like Amazon or weblogs. The research opportunities opened up by this socio-technological innovation are, as shown by the growing literature on the topic, huge. At the same time new challenges for social scientists arise. In this paper we will focus on two of the main challenges posed to the growth of the so-called computational social science: interdisciplinarity and ethics. While the searchability and persistence of this information make it ideal for sociological research, a quantitative approach is still challenging because of the size and complexity of the data. Collecting, storing and analyzing these data often require technical skills beyond the traditional curricula of social scientists. These projects require, in fact, collaboration with computer scientists. Nevertheless developing a common interdisciplinary project is often challenging because of the different backgrounds of the researchers. At the same time the availability of this content poses a challenge concerning privacy and research ethics. Due to the amount of data and the fact that the real identity of the author is often hidden behind a nickname, it is often impossible to ask the subject involved to consent to the use of their data. On the other hand, especially in the first wave of web 2.0, this information has been – intentionally or not – publicly shared by the users. While a technique of dis-embedding the identity of the user from the content analyzed is often the solution used to bypass this issue, an even more important privacy-related challenge for computational social science is emerging. Due to the wide adoption of social network sites such Facebook or Google+, where a user may decide to share his content with his/her group of friends only, the amount of public data will change and decrease in the future. We will discuss this issue by enumerating a number of possible future scenarios.}

abstract = {Recent neuroscientific evidence in human and non-human primates indicates that the regions that become active during motor execution and motor observation overlap extensively in the cerebral cortex. This suggests that to observe an action, these primates employ their motor and somatosensation areas in order to simulate it internally. In line with this finding, in the current paper, we examine relevant neuroscientific evidence in order to design a computational agent that can facilitate observational learning of reaching movements. For this reason, we develop a novel motor control system, inspired from contemporary theories of motor control, and demonstrate how it can be used during observation to facilitate learning, without the active involvement of the agent’s body. Our results show that novel motor skills can be acquired only by observation, by optimizing the peripheral components of the agent’s motion.}

The model takes as input a VR simulation video sequence and outputs the estimated average navigation velocity. When this estimated velocity is integrated into the published cybersickness dose value model (CSDV: So, 1999), the severity level of the cybersickness associated with the VR simulation can be predicted. Results of two simulation studies indicated that the average navigation velocities in lateral and vertical axes can be estimated to within 10% error. The simulations used a virtual environment (VE) with a known single depth. Discussion of an extension of the computational model to accommodate VEs with unknown multiple depths is included. The reported model is consistent with the biological neuro-pathway of the perception of visual motion velocities in humans. The benefits associated with this consistency are discussed.}

abstract = {A three-dimensional computational model is established to simulate the air flow patterns in the rotor spinning unit of a rotor spinning machine. The effects of rotor speed, rotor diameter and rotor slide wall angle on air flow characteristics and hence yarn properties are investigated. The airstream accelerates from the transfer channel inlet to the outlet. There are velocity differences in both the cross-section and along the transfer channel, causing hooked fibers to straighten. The airstream swirls around the rotor at a high speed. However, vortices that can cause fiber curving and buckling are formed inside the rotor. The effect of rotor speed is significant. There are more vortices near the wall at a lower rotor speed, while too large a rotor speed can lead to an excessive centrifugal force, thus increasing yarn breakages. The rotor diameter affects the flow characteristics in a way similar to that of rotor speed. As a smaller slide wall angle generates higher velocities in the transfer channel and more stable velocities in the rotor groove, a small angle is preferable. Computational modeling has provided a useful insight into the rotor spinning flow pattern, thus it can be used to optimize the rotor design to produce better rotor spun yarn.}

The sources of influence on our model’s behavior are: beliefs about the world’s possible states and actions causing transitions between them; baseline preferences for certain actions; a variable tendency to infer and share goals in observed behavior; and a variable tendency to act efficiently to reach rewarding states. Acting on these premises, our model is able to replicate key empirical studies of social learning in children and chimpanzees. We demonstrate how a simple artificial system can account for a variety of biological social transfer phenomena, such as goal-inference and over-imitation, by taking into account action constraints and incomplete knowledge about the world dynamics.}

abstract = {Computational photography is currently altering the representational and social functions of photographic imaging. A range of heavily automated computational processing techniques produce images that remediate digital photography to circumvent physical limitations associated with the size of smartphones, emulating the aesthetics associated with larger format digital cameras and professional photographic workflows and practices. These processes include automated compositing where images seen by users are constituted of up to 15 individual frames, the simulation of a shallow depth-of-field, automated facial retouching and even providing automated assistance to suggest alternative frames within the image stream to serve as the base image. This article explores these emerging techniques and accompanying claims that such processes are radically transforming photographic practice. While the extent and modes of automation and algorithmic processing depart from prior practices, contextualising them within the histories of photographic compositing and the algorithmic malleability of digital photography suggests the intensification of existing trends rather than an epistemic break. Furthermore, exploring the representational politics of automated facial retouching and the datafication of images situates these changes within the broader social context of dataveillance and platform capitalism.}
