abstract = {The efficient global optimization method is a global optimization technique that can select the next sample point automatically by infill sampling criteria and search for the global minimum with less samples than the conventional global optimization needs. Infill sampling criteria function consists of the predictor and mean square error provided from the kriging model, which is a stochastic metamodel. Also, the constrained efficient global optimization method can minimize the objective function when dealing with constraints under the efficient global optimization concept. In this study, the constrained efficient global optimization method was applied to the RAE2822 airfoil shape design formulated with constraint. But the noisy computational fluid dynamics data caused the kriging model to fail to depict the true function. The distorted kriging model would make the efficient global optimization deviate from the correct search. This distortion of kriging model can be handled with the interpolation (p = free) kriging model. With the interpolation (p = free) kriging model, however, the search for efficient global optimization solution was stalled in a narrow feasible region, so there were less chances to update the objective and constraint functions. Then the accuracy of the efficient global optimization solution may not be good enough, so the three-step search method is proposed to obtain an accurate global minimum as well as prevent the distortion of kriging model for the noisy constrained computational fluid dynamics problem.}

abstract = {Hospitals are plagued with a multitude of logistical challenges amplified by a time-sensitive and high intensity environment. These conditions have resulted in burnout among both doctors and nurses as they work tirelessly to provide critical care to patients in need. We propose a new machine-learning-powered matching mechanism that manages the surgeon-nurse-patient assignment process in an efficient way that saves time and energy for hospitals, enabling them to focus almost entirely on delivering effective care. Through this design, we show how incorporating artificial intelligence into management systems enables teams of all sizes to meaningfully coordinate in highly chaotic and complex environments.}

abstract = {Abstract Velocity measurements were made in the catalyst system of a firing engine using a one-component laser Doppler velocimetry system. The 1.4 l engine was operated at 2000 r/min and 88 per cent full-load condition. Velocity pulsations were observed in one of the runners supplying the catalyst and downstream of the catalyst. The velocity pulsations measured downstream of the catalyst enabled the mean velocity profile to be found. Observations were compared with simulations obtained from a coupling of the Star-CD computational fluid dynamics code, which modelled the catalyst as a three-dimensional component, with the Ricardo WAVE one-dimensional engine-cycle simulation code. The velocities in the runners were predicted to fluctuate between –65 m/s and 240 m/s. The observed velocity showed a similar pulse shape but a smaller magnitude of reversed flow. The velocities downstream of the catalyst were predicted to fluctuate between –5 and 22 m/s. The observed velocities showed smaller amplitude pulsations and significantly lower magnitudes of reversed flow, consistent with the input runner observations. The coupled simulation was shown to give good qualitative agreement with measurements, with quantitative predictions being most accurate near the catalyst centre but less accurate at locations closer to the outer wall.}

abstract = {Bruner, Goodnow, and Austin’s (1956) research on concept development is re-examined from a connectionist perspective. A neural network was constructed which associates positive and negative instances of a concept with their corresponding attribute values. Two methods were used to help preserve the ecological validity of the input: 1) closely mapping the input to the actual visual stimuli; and 2) structuring the output layer based on Gagne’s (1962, 1985) work on human concept learning. This resulted in the addition of output units referred to as attribute context constraints. These units required the network to demonstrate the identification of attributes both relevant and irrelevant to the task of classification. Results suggest that the simultaneous learning of attributes guided the network in constructing a faster and more generalizable representation than when attribute constraints were absent. Results are discussed with respect to the advantages of computational approaches to studying learning.}

The method followed four main phases: exploring tiling, testing connectivity, fabrication, and assembly. Shape grammar was considered during the design principles implementation to respond to climatic behavior. Space-filling shapes method known as the “Generalized Abeille Tiles” was followed to ensure tiling connectivity. The experimentation involves manual folding techniques without any software. A survey was conducted among first-year and fourth-year students post-introduction to computational software. The results showed a wide range of alternative geometries with different self-shading patterns generated. It highlighted that facade fabrication aided students in comprehending computational logic, easing the understanding of computational software complexity. This pilot study emphasizes the effectiveness of teaching computational concepts in early curricula.}

The proof of this latter result is based on a reduction from the monotone circuit value problem by building logic gates and wires which work with an initial sand distribution in KSPM. These results are also related to the known prediction problem for sandpiles which is in NC1 for one-dimensional sandpiles and P-complete for dimension 3 or higher. The computational complexity of the prediction problem remains open for the Bak’s model of two-dimensional sandpiles.}

The radial distribution of axial velocity at the design flowrate is calculated when an empirical radial distribution of circulation is given. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling of the overall performance and the detailed flow field is performed using TASCflow software. A standard k—ɛ turbulence model combined with standard wall functions is used. A frozen rotor approach is employed to simulate the rotor—stator coupling flow field. The overall performances of the water-jet pump and the radial distribution of velocity components at the exit of the impeller are also measured. Good agreement of the overall performance, such as the pressure rise, the power, and the efficiency, between CFD and experiment is obtained. The detailed velocity fields from inviscid analysis, CFD, and experiment are compared and investigated.}

abstract = {Purpose Stenosis in a vascular access circuit is the predominant cause of access dysfunction. Hemodynamic significance of a stenosis identified by angiography in an access circuit is uncertain. This study utilizes computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to model flow through arteriovenous fistula to predict the functional significance of stenosis in vascular access circuits. Methods Three-dimensional models of fistulas were created with a range of clinically relevant stenoses using SolidWorks. Stenoses diameters ranged from 1.0 to 3.0 mm and lengths from 5 to 60 mm within a fistula diameter of 7 mm. CFD analyses were performed using a blood model over a range of blood pressures. Eight patient-specific stenoses were also modeled and analyzed with CFD and the resulting blood flow calculations were validated by comparison with brachial artery flow measured by duplex ultrasound. Results Predicted flow rates were derived from CFD analysis of a range of stenoses. These stenoses were modeled by CFD and correlated with the ultrasound measured flow rate through the fistula of eight patients. The calculated flow rate using CFD correlated within 20% of ultrasound measured flow for five of eight patients. The mean difference was 17.2% (ranged from 1.3% to 30.1%). Conclusions CFD analysis-generated flow rate tables provide valuable information to assess the functional significance of stenosis detected during imaging studies. The CFD study can help in determining the clinical relevance of a stenosis in access dysfunction and guide the need for intervention.}

The framework is developed through an extensive literature review, drawing from a diverse range of sources. It integrates technical proficiencies, soft skills, adaptability, a global perspective, stakeholder collaboration, experiential learning, predictive skills, and a commitment to continuous curriculum updates to create a holistic educational model. The conceptual framework places technical skills at its core, and expertise in emerging technologies. Soft skills such as critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration, are integrated to foster a well-rounded skill set. A transdisciplinary approach encourages exploration beyond traditional LIS boundaries. The LISI4C framework also underscores the importance of sense-making, adaptability, and a global perspective in preparing graduates for the dynamic 4IR landscape. This paper contributes to the LIS education field by offering a forward-looking LISI4C framework that aligns LIS curriculum with the requirements of 4IR. The framework draws upon key elements, including technical proficiencies, soft skills, adaptability, a global perspective, stakeholder collaboration, experiential learning, predictive skills, and continuous curriculum updates, to create a holistic and forward-looking educational model.}

Within this context, computational fluid dynamics simulations nowadays represent a powerful tool to understand the in-cylinder evolution of spray and air–fuel charge. To guarantee the accuracy of the adopted multidimensional spray sub-models, it is mandatory to validate the computed results against available experimental data under well-defined operating conditions. To this end, in this work, the authors proposed the calibration and validation of a comprehensive set of spray sub-models by means of the simulation of the Spray G experiment, available in the context of the engine combustion network. For a suitable validation of the proposed numerical setup in addition to the baseline condition, gasoline direct injection operating points typical of early injection with homogeneous operation, late injection with high ambient density and flash boiling with enhanced fuel evaporation were also simulated. Numerical computations were validated against a wide set of available experimental data by means of an accurate post-processing analysis taking into account axial liquid and vapor penetrations, gas-phase velocity between spray plumes, droplet size, plume liquid velocity, direction and mass distribution. Satisfactory results were achieved with the proposed setup, which is able to predict gasoline spray evolution under different operating conditions.}

abstract = {This paper investigates on a computational simulation of Twaron® fabric against ballistic impact. It proposed a hybrid shell element model considering the strain-rate-sensitive failure criterion. This model innovatively provided a resolution of the yarn level to better capture the unique properties of the woven fabric, such as yarn crimp, sliding contact between yarns, stress transmission on yarns and yarn broken. The fabric is modeled using a hybrid shell element analysis approach aim of reducing the complexity and computational expense while ensuring accuracy. The response characteristics of fabric under high velocity ballistic impact are studied by applying a 3D finite element program DYNA3D in this paper and the experimental investigation had been taken by Shim et al. According to the computational and experimental results, transverse deflection distribution and stress transmission of fabrics are presented. The ballistic limit, energy absorption, remaining velocity are calculated by simulation models and compared with the experimental results. This approach is also validated by comparing it against a 2D uniform shell model and a 3D interlacing shell model. The results show that the hybrid model can accurately reflect the buckling and fluctuation behavior of fabrics and has a relatively few computational consumption at the same time.}

We measured people’s pupillary responses as they produced spoken descriptions of depicted events. We manipulated the syntactic structure of the target by training subjects to use different types of sentences following a colour cue. The results showed higher increase in pupil size for the production of passive and object dislocated sentences than for active canonical subject–verb–object sentences, indicating that more cognitive effort is associated with more complex noncanonical thematic order. We also manipulated the time at which the cue that triggered structure-building processes was presented. Differential increase in pupil diameter for more complex sentences was shown to rise earlier as the colour cue was presented earlier, suggesting that the observed pupillary changes are due to differential demands in relatively independent structure-building processes during grammatical planning. Task-evoked pupillary responses provide a reliable measure to study the cognitive processes involved in sentence production.}

These methods are accurate numerical method, temperature stratification method, and uniform temperature method. The accurate numerical method can accurately predict the performance of the system, but it takes about 4 to 5 weeks, which is too long and hard for the performance analysis of this system. The temperature stratification method obtains relatively accurate computation results and takes a relatively short computation time, which is about 2 to 3 hours. Therefore, this method is most suitable for the performance analysis of this system. The deviation of the computational results of the uniform temperature method is great, and the time consumed is similar to that of the temperature stratification method. Therefore, this method is not recommended herein. Based on the above analyses, the temperature stratification method is applied to analyze the influence of the embedded depth of water tank, the thickness of thermal insulation material, and the collection area on the performance of this system. The results will provide a design basis for the related demonstration projects.}

abstract = {Infrared radiation signatures of gas turbine engine exhaust are suppressed markedly when equipped with a serpentine nozzle compared to an axisymmetric nozzle. The aim of this paper is to research more detailed flow characteristics of the serpentine nozzle, and to this end a double serpentine nozzle cold fluid test was conducted in this paper, static pressures on the nozzle walls surface were measured, and schlieren flow visualizations downstream of the nozzle exit were observed. Then numerical simulations of the experimental model were carried out using CFD software with k-ɛ turbulence model adopted. And the effects of geometric design parameters (the length ratio of first S length to second S length and the centerline distributions) on serpentine nozzle performance were investigated numerically. Detailed flow characteristics were presented including the distributions of static pressure, Ma number (streamlines), wall shear stress (limited streamlines), and the total pressure. Results show good agreement between the experimental data and computation. Static pressure distributions on the upper and down walls surface of double serpentine nozzle are completely different compared to the traditional axisymmetric nozzle. The rapid turning and steep passage slope of the serpentine nozzle would result in high friction loss and strong secondary flow loss, hence the value of the length ratio of first S passage to second S passage is recommended to be chosen from 2:5 to 2:3. The centerline distributions are crucial to the nozzle design for its influence on air acceleration inside the nozzle. The centerlines with a rapid turning at the exit would result in a high Ma number, which brings on high friction loss and secondary loss at the turnings. For maximum efficiency of centerline distributions, it is recommended that curves with a gentle turning at each serpentine passage exit should be chosen.}

abstract = {The major issue in stainless steelmaking is the difficulty of oxidising carbon from molten steel without also oxidising large proportions of expensive chromium. This can, however, be achieved by reducing the partial pressure of the gaseous product of carbon oxidation, carbon monoxide, by dilution with argon. Modern stainless steelmaking is dominated by duplex processes which prepare a high carbon melt in an electric arc furnace, and then decarburise it in an argon–oxygen decarburisation (AOD) converter. In this work, the thermodynamic basis of preferential carbon oxidation by dilution of oxygen with argon is discussed, together with a review of AOD practice. The AOD process was simulated using computational thermodynamics software to illustrate the way in which it can achieve very low carbon levels in the molten steel bath without excessive co-oxidation of chromium. The slag reduction stage using ferrosilicon additions was also modelled and shown to be able to recover almost all oxidised chromium from the slag, limited only by the accompanying increase in the silicon content of the steel. The models, although simple and easy to develop, correctly predicted all trends in output variables as input parameters were changed and often matched plant data very well. The models provide a valuable learning tool for those interested in pyrometallurgical processing in general, and stainless steelmaking in particular.}
