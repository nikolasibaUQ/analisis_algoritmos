abstract = {Within the context of the growing polarisation and fragmentation of the urban landscape, this paper presents a computational typology applicable to the study of minority communities, both ethnic and religious, which is useful in understanding their spatial distribution and juxtaposition at neighbourhood levels. The typology has been applied to multicultural London with the use of the 2001 Census, in which there were questions on ethnicity and religion. The landscape of religion is found to be more highly segregated in contrast to the landscape of ethnicity. Furthermore, on the basis of a preliminary analysis of indicator variables, minorities seem on aggregate to be in an improved situation given a level of residential segregation, with the exception of residents of segregated Asian-Bangladeshi areas for ethnicity and residents of segregated Muslim areas for religion. This questions the generally held view that segregation in a multicultural society is undesirable per se and suggests that a ‘one size fits all’ government policy towards residential segregation is insufficiently perceptive. The typology introduced here should facilitate a more critically informed approach to multiculturalism and the contemporary city.}

abstract = {There is increasing interest in the use of mechanism-based multi-scale computational models (such as agent-based models (ABMs)) to generate simulated clinical populations in order to discover and evaluate potential diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. The description of the environment in which a biomedical simulation operates (model context) and parameterization of internal model rules (model content) requires the optimization of a large number of free parameters. In this work, we utilize a nested active learning (AL) workflow to efficiently parameterize and contextualize an ABM of systemic inflammation used to examine sepsis. Contextual parameter space was examined using four parameters external to the model’s rule set. The model’s internal parameterization, which represents gene expression and associated cellular behaviors, was explored through the augmentation or inhibition of signaling pathways for 12 signaling mediators associated with inflammation and wound healing. We have implemented a nested AL approach in which the clinically relevant (CR) model environment space for a given internal model parameterization is mapped using a small Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The outer AL level workflow is a larger ANN that uses AL to efficiently regress the volume and centroid location of the CR space given by a single internal parameterization. We have reduced the number of simulations required to efficiently map the CR parameter space of this model by approximately 99%. In addition, we have shown that more complex models with a larger number of variables may expect further improvements in efficiency.}

abstract = {A number of toxic effects are brought about by the covalent interaction between the toxicant and biological macromolecules. In chemico assays are available that attempt to identify reactive compounds. These approaches have been developed independently for pharmaceuticals and for other non-pharmaceutical compounds. The assays vary widely in terms of the macromolecule (typically a peptide) and the analytical technique utilised. For both sets of methods, there are great opportunities to capture in chemico information by using in silico methods to provide computational tools for screening purposes. In order to use these in chemico and in silico methods, integrated testing strategies are required for individual toxicity endpoints. The potential for the use of these approaches is described, and a number of recommendations to improve this extremely useful technique, in terms of implementing the Three Rs in toxicity testing, are presented.}

Twelve researchers of varying experience levels attempted to reproduce the results of the empirical articles in the target issue (at least three researchers per article). We found that all 14 articles provided at least some data and six provided analysis code, but only one article was rated to be exactly reproducible, and three were rated as essentially reproducible with minor deviations.

abstract = {Numerical analysis is increasingly used for batch modelling runs, with each individual model possessing a unique combination of input parameters sampled from a range of potential values. Whilst such an approach can help to develop a comprehensive understanding of the inherent unpredictability and variability of explosive events, or populate training/validation data sets for machine learning approaches, the associated computational expense is relatively high. Furthermore, any given model may share a number of common solution steps with other models in the batch, and simulating all models from birth to termination may result in large amounts of repetition. This paper presents a new branching algorithm that ensures calculation steps are only computed once by identifying when the parameter fields of each model in the batch becomes unique. This enables informed data mapping to take place, leading to a reduction in the required computation time. The branching algorithm is explained using a conceptual walk-through for a batch of 9 models, featuring a blast load acting on a structural panel in 2D. By eliminating repeat steps, approximately 50% of the run time can be saved. This is followed by the development and use of the algorithm in 3D for a practical application involving 20 complex containment structure models. In this instance, a ∼20% reduction in computational costs is achieved.}

abstract = {For a better insight in dialyzer efficiency with respect to local mass transport in a low flux dialyzer (Fresenius F6HPS), blood and dialysate flow distributions were visualized with computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations, which were validated with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. To visualize blood-side flow while avoiding transport through the fiber membrane, a bolus of 99m-Technetium labeled MAA (Macro Aggregated Albumin) was injected in the flow using an electronic valve. Water was used to simulate blood, but flow rate was adjusted according to laws of dynamic similarity to account for the viscosity difference (factor 2.75). For the visualization of dialysate flow, a bolus of 99m-Technetium labeled DMSA (Dimercaptosuccinic Acid) was injected, while pressurized air in the blood compartment avoided transmembrane flow. For each test series, 3D acquisitions were made on a two respectively three-headed SPECT camera. By evaluating the images at different time steps, dynamic 3D intensity plots were obtained, which were further used to derive local flow velocities. Additionally, three-dimensional CFD models were developed for simulating the overall blood and dialysate flow, respectively. In both models, the whole fiber compartment was defined as a porous medium with overall axial and radial permeability derived theoretically and from in vitro tests. With the imaging as well as with the computational technique, a homogeneous blood flow distribution was found, while vortices and fluid stagnation were observed in the dialyzer inlet manifold. The non-homogeneous dialysate distribution, as found with SPECT imaging, implies the occurrence of non-efficient sites with respect to mass transfer. The discrepancy between the dialysate results of both techniques indicated that the assumption of a constant fiber bundle permeability in the CFD model was too optimistic. In conclusion, medical imaging techniques like SPECT are very helpful to validate CFD models, which can be further applied for dialyzer design and optimization.}

abstract = {A fully coupled thermomechanical finite element analysis of the friction-stir welding (FSW) process developed in the authors’ previous work is combined with the basic physical metallurgy of Ti—6Al—4V to predict/assess the structural response of FSW joints. A close examination of the experimental results reported in the open literature reveals that in most cases the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of the weld possesses the most inferior properties and tends to control the overall structural performance of the weld. Taking this observation into account, a microstructure evolution model is developed and parameterized for the Ti—6Al—4V material residing in the HAZ. Specifically, this model addresses the problem of temporal evolution of the globular α-phase particles located within prior β-phase grains (the dominant microstructural parameter in the HAZ) during the FSW process. Next this model is combined with the well-established property versus microstructure correlations in Ti—6Al—4V in order to predict the overall structural performance of the weld. The results obtained are found to be in reasonably good agreement with their experimental counterparts, suggesting that the present computational approach may be used to guide the selection of FSW process parameters in order to optimize the structural performance of FSW joints (at least while they are controlled by the HAZ-material microstructure/properties).}

Combining a computational media content analysis and a two-wave panel survey, the research demonstrates that while exposure to certain frames in the mainstream media would directly lead to public support for a stricter immigration policy, partisan media tend to affect public opinion indirectly by influencing their feelings toward immigrants in opposite directions.}

Area-spread assignment did a better job of replicating volumes on the detailed network, although computation times were much longer.}

Conventional, DAMAS, and CLEAN-SC array processing is applied in an identical fashion to the experimental and computational results for three different configurations involving deploying and retracting the main landing gear and a part-span flap. Despite the short time records of the numerical signals, the beamform maps are able to isolate the noise sources, and the appearance of the DAMAS synthetic array maps is generally better than those from the experimental data. The experimental CLEAN-SC maps are similar in quality to those from the simulations indicating that CLEAN-SC may have less sensitivity to background noise. The spectrum obtained from DAMAS processing of synthetic array data is nearly identical to the spectrum of the center microphone of the array, indicating that for this problem array processing of synthetic data does not improve spectral comparisons with experiment. However, the beamform maps do provide an additional means of comparison that can reveal differences that cannot be ascertained from spectra alone.}

abstract = {To improve the fuel efficiency of automobile internal combustion engines, the friction reduction of each engine moving part is important. Recently, carbon films have been attracting much interest as surface-coating materials due to its excellent properties such as low friction and good wear resistance. In this study, the low-friction mechanisms of carbon films were analyzed using molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations. Molecular dynamics simulation results showed that the termination of OH groups on the surface of the diamond substantially reduced the friction coefficient from 0.07 to 0.01. This reduction was achieved because termination of OH groups weakened the covalent interaction between Fe and C atoms, which was indicated by density functional theory calculations. Additionally, based on the concept of terminating the OH groups on the surface of diamond-like carbon films, we carried out the reciprocating friction experiment between hydrogen-free diamond-like carbon surface and glycerin, which contains large number of OH groups. The friction coefficient of the glycerin was 0.028, much lower than that of the base oil, which was 0.075. The experiments confirmed that OH groups on the surface of hydrogen-free diamond-like carbon films greatly improved the friction properties of its films.}

Mathematical formalism applied to cultural concepts is more than an exercise in model building, as it provides a way to represent and explore their logical consistency and implications. Not surprisingly, kinship terminologies are particularly amenable to formal representation. Researchers throughout the history of kinship studies have noted the logicality of kinship terminology systems. The logic is explored here through the kin term computations made by users of a terminology when computing the kinship relation one person has to another by referring to a third person for whom each has a kin term relationship. Kinship Algebra Modeler provides a set of tools, services, and an architecture to explore kinship terminologies and their properties in an accessible manner.}

abstract = {Calcium silicate hydrate Jennite is a molecular structure commonly accepted as a representation of the complex calcium silicate hydrate gel formed during the hydration of typical Portland cement. In this paper, the behavior of nanoscale calcium silicate hydrate Jennite under shear deformation was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. Computational samples representing the nanoscale structure of calcium silicate hydrate Jennite were subjected to shear deformation in order to investigate not only their mechanical properties but also their deformation behavior. The simulation results indicated that the nanoscale calcium silicate hydrate Jennite under shear deformation displays a linear elastic behavior up to shear stress of approximately 1.0 GPa, and shear deformation of about 0.08 radians, after which point yielding and plastic deformation occurs. The shear modulus determined from the simulations was 11.2 ± 0.7 GPa. The deformation-induced displacements in molecular structures were analyzed dividing the system in regions representing calcium oxide layers. The displacement/deformation of the layers of calcium oxide forming the structure of nanoscale calcium silicate hydrate Jennite was analyzed. The non-linear stress–strain behavior in the molecular structure was attributed to a non-linear increase in the displacement due to sliding of the calcium oxide layers on top of each other with higher shearing. These results support the idea that by controlling the chemical reactions, the tailored morphologies can be used to increase the interlinking between the calcium oxide layers, thus minimizing the shearing of the layers and leading to molecular structures that can withstand larger deformation and have improved failure behavior.}

This allows us to investigate if more violent content is shared more times and faster than less violent content on Twitter, and if different online communities can be characterized by the level of violence of the visual content they share. The results show that the level of violence in an image tweet does not correlate with the number of retweets and mentions it receives that the time to retweet is marginally lower for image tweets containing a high level of violence and that the level of violence in image tweets differs between communities.}

For this, five wing designs are considered in this paper. Computational fluid dynamics simulations using ANSYS FLUENT® are conducted for each wing design. The CL/CD ratios for all the wings are calculated at increasing angles of attack (simulating Climbing) and increasing speed (simulating Acceleration). Compared to the NACA 4415 airfoil, which is utilized by the RQ-7 Shadow, the EPPLER 559 provides an increase in lift at the low angles of attack, but yields less of these benefits as the angle of attack increases. The tapered planform significantly reduces the high drag associated with the EPPLER 559 airfoil. The generation of higher lift forces with lower drag is further achieved by increasing the aspect ratio and through the addition of a winglet. When compared to the NACA 4415 airfoil, it is concluded that the EPPLER 559 airfoil is a viable candidate for subsonic unmanned aerial vehicle applications only when the components of wing design are altered. The performance of the wings that employ the EPPLER 559 airfoil improves when the planform is changed from rectangular to tapered, when the aspect ratio is increased and when a winglet is added.}

abstract = {Polarizationless P systems with active membranes are non-cooperative systems, that is, the left-hand side of their rules have a single object. Usually, these systems make use of division rules as a mechanism to produce an exponential workspace in linear time. Division rules are inspired by cell division, a process of nuclear division that occurs when a parent cell divides to produce two identical daughter cells. On the other hand, separation rules are inspired by the membrane fission process, a mechanism by which a biological membrane is split into two new ones in such a manner that the contents of the initial membrane is distributed between the new membranes. In this paper, separation rules are used instead of division rules. The computational efficiency of these models is studied and the role of the (minimal) cooperation in object evolution rules is explored from a computational complexity point of view.}
