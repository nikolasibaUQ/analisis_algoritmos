abstract = {Abstract Modelling the premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI) engine requires a balanced approach that captures both fluid motion as well as low- and high-temperature fuel oxidation. A fully integrated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and chemistry scheme (i.e. detailed chemical kinetics solved in every cell of the CFD grid) would be the ideal PCCI modelling approach, but is computationally very expensive. As a result, modelling assumptions are required in order to develop tools that are computationally efficient, yet maintain an acceptable degree of accuracy. Multi-zone models have been previously shown accurately to capture geometry-dependent processes in homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines. In the presented work, KIVA-3V is fully coupled with a multi-zone model with detailed chemical kinetics. Computational efficiency is achieved by utilizing a low-resolution discretization to solve detailed chemical kinetics in the multi-zone model compared with a relatively high-resolution CFD solution. The multi-zone model communicates with KIVA-3V at each computational timestep, as in the ideal fully integrated case. The composition of the cells, however, is mapped back and forth between KTVA-3V and the multi-zone model, introducing significant computational time savings. The methodology uses a novel re-mapping technique that can account for both temperature and composition non-uniformities in the cylinder. Validation cases were developed by solving the detailed chemistry in every cell of a KIVA-3V grid. The new methodology shows very good agreement with the detailed solutions in terms of ignition timing, burn duration, and emissions.}

abstract = {The fabric air dispersion system (FADS) is a ventilation terminal made of special polymer fabric. The porous structure of the fabric causes complex flow motion. Due to its advantages over the conventional ventilation system, i.e. ducts and diffusers, the FADS has been widely favoured by architects and researchers. In computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation the FADS is usually simplified into a free opening with an area equal to all pores and perforations, called the free area (FA) method in this present work. However, the effectiveness of this simplified method has not been validated. The present work took a half cylindrical FADS without orifices as an example and employed the FA method to simulate the airflow properties inside a chamber under isothermal and non-isothermal conditions. The simulated distributions of air velocity and temperature were compared with those by the direct description (DD) method. Meanwhile, the uniformity of air velocity distribution close to the FADS was validated against test data and the flow visualization using the dry ice as a smoking material. Results demonstrate that the FA method is effective and easy to implement, and performs as well as the DD method in predicting the distribution of airflow generated by the FADS without orifices.}

abstract = {Liver cancer kills approximately 800 thousand people annually worldwide, and its most common subtype is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which usually affects people with cirrhosis. Predicting survival of patients with HCC remains an important challenge, especially because technologies needed for this scope are not available in all hospitals. In this context, machine learning applied to medical records can be a fast, low-cost tool to predict survival and detect the most predictive features from health records. In this study, we analyzed medical data of 165 patients with HCC: we employed computational intelligence to predict their survival, and to detect the most relevant clinical factors able to discriminate survived from deceased cases. Afterwards, we compared our data mining results with those obtained through statistical tests and scientific literature findings. Our analysis revealed that blood levels of alkaline-phosphatase (ALP), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and hemoglobin are the most effective prognostic factors in this dataset. We found literature supporting association of these three factors with hepatoma, even though only AFP has been used in a prognostic index. Our results suggest that ALP and hemoglobin can be candidates for future HCC prognostic indexes, and that physicians could focus on ALP, AFP, and hemoglobin when studying HCC records.}

abstract = {All over the world, the oil and gas industries are the most important source of energy. The likelihood of subsea gas and oil leakage is increasing, which can cause threats and harmful impacts on the marine environment and potentially catastrophic events such as fires, explosives, and the loss of structural integrity of subsea infrastructure. Also, Physical models have usually been used to predict sea currents, but they are unstable to disturbances and hence incorrect over long periods of time. Machine learning approaches are more resistant than the physical models that have usually been used to predict sea currents. Also, Physical models have usually been used to predict sea currents. Nonetheless, they are not stable to disturbances and thus are not correct for long periods of time. Machine learning approaches are more resistant than the physical models that have usually been used to predict sea currents. Machine learning approaches are more resistant to change and perturbation. Therefore, the goal of this research is to assess the potential of hazards of the gas plume from subsea pipeline rupture till reaching the sea surface by changing the influence parameters on gas plume to assist petroleum companies in developing risk assessment strategies by assessing and simulating subsea gas release in order to contain the leakage by developing coupling models one for machine learning code which can predict the upcoming water current speed by using Multiple Linear Regression algorithm and hooked it by UDF to a second model which implements Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model to study subsea gas release under current effects. Engebretsen’s Rotvoll experiment data is being used to validate the numerical computational fluid dynamics model. The rising time and fountain height and horizontal migration for gas release are the essential factors to be considered while evaluating the gas dispersion through our study by changing the influencing parameters such as leakage hole sizes, water current speeds, gas velocity, and water depths in the presence of water current in all cases. Also, applied our simulation to real case parameters for one of the Egyptian Petroleum Companies. These findings might aid in evaluating the hazards and response planning in the event of subsea gas leakage.}

The simulation is conducted using linear elastic fracture mechanics based on Paris’ model, and the maximum tensile stress and displacement correlation methods are applied to calculate the crack direction and stress intensity factor, respectively. Several strategies are applied in order to predict the crack propagations through various welded zones regarding the corresponding parameters and Paris constants for each zone. The entire crack growth process is investigated step by step through all of the FSW zones, and the fatigue lifetimes of the FSW joint under various loading conditions are predicted by implementing the same procedure. The numerical results are validated with experimental and analytical work.}

This article examines whether the lessons of internal evaluations differed from those of external evaluations in the case of international development aid. It analyzes internal evaluations of the Asian Development Bank for nearly 1000 sovereign interventions across 38 countries in the Asia-Pacific during 1996–2016, using computational text analysis or text mining techniques. The results show that internal evaluations focused more on micro- and meso-level characteristics, while external evaluations laid more emphasis on meso- and macro-level constructs, such as dimensions of policy and the institutional environment in the recipient country, or its level and rate of economic growth. The article concludes that internal and external evaluations can be combined to create a multilevel evaluation framework that integrates micro-, meso-, and macro-level lessons to facilitate better learning.}

The use of these motion lines is notable because they do not seem to be related to anything in the optic array. The dynamic behavior of a neural-network model for contour detection is analyzed and it is shown that it generates trails of oriented responses behind moving stimuli. The properties of the oriented response trails are shown to correspond to motion lines. The model generates trails of different orientations depending on the speed and length of the movement, and thereby predicts different uses of two types of motion lines. The model further predicts that motion lines should bias real motion in some situations. An experiment relating motion lines to ambiguous motion percepts demonstrates that motion lines contribute to motion percepts.}

Together, these frame the “algorithmic as if” as a magical and affective space for realizing impossible longings that are also reflexive encounters with the “limit-situation” of human mortality.}

The study of hominin technical thinking, as in the case of stone tool making, is a good way to bring that question to the fore. This article argues that archaeologists who study lithic artefacts and their transformations over the course of human evolution are uniquely well positioned to contribute to the ongoing debate about the marks of the mental. Adopting the material engagement approach, I propose to replace the internalist vision of mentality, that is, the vision of a brain-bound mind that is using the body to execute and externalise preconceived mental plan through the stone, with an ecological-enactive vision of participatory mentality where bodily acts and materials act together to generate rather than merely execute thought processes. I argue that the latter participatory view changes the geography of the cognitive and offers a better description for the continuity of mind and matter that we see in the lithic record.}

Such benefits come not only from the expressiveness that argumentation-based techniques bring to agent communication but also from the reasoning and decision-making capabilities under conditions of conflicting and uncertain information that argumentation enables for autonomous agents. When developing multi-agent applications in which argumentation will be used to improve agent communication and reasoning, argumentation schemes (reasoning patterns for argumentation) are useful in addressing the requirements of the application domain in regards to argumentation (e.g., defining the scope in which argumentation will be used by agents in that particular application). In this work, we propose an argumentation framework that takes into account the particular structure of argumentation schemes at its core. This paper formally defines such a framework and experimentally evaluates its implementation for both argumentation-based reasoning and dialogues.}

abstract = {Given a constant stream of perceptual stimuli, how can the underlying invariances associated with a given input be learned? One approach consists of using generic truths about the spatiotemporal structure of the physical world as constraints on the types of quantities learned. The learning methodology employed here embodies one such truth: that perceptually salient properties (such as stereo disparity) tend to vary smoothly over time. Unfortunately, the units of an artificial neural network tend to encode superficial image properties, such as individual grey-level pixel values, which vary rapidly over time. However, if the states of units are constrained to vary slowly, then the network is forced to learn a smoothly varying function of the training data. We implemented this temporal-smoothness constraint in a backpropagation network which learned stereo disparity from random-dot stereograms. Temporal smoothness was formalised with the use of regularisation theory by modifying the standard cost function minimised during training of a network. Temporal smoothness was found to be similar to other techniques for improving generalisation, such as early stopping and weight decay. However, in contrast to these, the theoretical underpinnings of temporal smoothing are intimately related to fundamental characteristics of the physical world. Results are discussed in terms of regularisation theory and the physically realistic assumptions upon which temporal smoothing is based.}

The blade shape change was achieved by shape memory alloys strips, thermomechanically treated, embedded in the blade and thermally activated by hot air stream flow. Measurement of fluid temperature, blade surface temperature pattern and three-dimensional shape change of the blade during activation was performed by means of an innovative image analysis technique in a purpose-built wind tunnel.

In most cases, methyl group elimination was also favorable. Methyl group elimination occurred in three different ways, the most interesting being hydrogen rearrangement from a neighboring alkyl group to a ring carbon, which led to a benzyl radical formation.

abstract = {For designing bolted connections in machinery applications, it is necessary to estimate the stiffness of the threaded connection. This work provides a new method for computing the stiffness of engaged screw in bolted connections according to the load distribution in screw thread. Finite element analysis is performed by building the three-dimensional model of threaded connection. A set of tensile tests are exerted to validate the accuracy of the suggested model of threaded connection. A good agreement is obtained when the analytical results are compared with finite element analysis results, experimental data, and Yamamoto method. Results reveal that the ultimate strength of thread connections is obviously lower than that of thread material. In addition, the results of calculation and finite element analysis indicated that increasing Young’s modulus of material and the engaged length or decreasing thread pitch could increase the stiffness of the thread portion of a bolt and nut.}

abstract = {As a method for bonding powdered materials, sintering has distinct advantages, such as the production of a near final-shape of the desired product, without the need for significant post-processing. However, sintering has certain deficiencies, such as incomplete or weak bonding. Research is ongoing to improve the process. One approach to improve sintering processes of powdered materials is via electrically enhanced bonding, whereby electricity is pumped through the material, while it is compressed in a press, in order to induce Joule-heating. This paper develops a computationally based model for the direct simulation of electrically enhanced sintering of powdered materials using particle-based methods. The overall approach is to construct three coupled sub-models which primarily involve: (a) particle-to-particle mechanical contact, (b) particle-to-particle thermal exchange and (c) particle-to-particle electrical current flow. These physical processes are strongly coupled, since the dynamics dictates which particles are in contact and the contacts determine the electrical flow. The flow of electricity controls the Joule-heating and the induced thermal fields, which soften the material, leading to enhanced particle binding. The strong multiphysics-coupled sub-models are solved iteratively within each time-step using a recursive staggering scheme, which employs temporal adaptivity to control the error. If the process does not converge (to within an error tolerance) within a preset number of iterations, the time-step is adapted (reduced) by utilizing an estimate of the spectral radius of the coupled system. The modular approach allows for easy replacement of submodels, if needed. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the model and numerical solution scheme.}
