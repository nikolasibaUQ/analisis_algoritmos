abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used in a study of the air flow char acteristics in the occupied building zone. Correlation equations between the mean air speeds and the percentage dissatisfied with the macroscopic flow numbers were derived. Ten macroscopic flow numbers including the total ventilation rate, the air change rate, ventilation rate, air diffusion performance index, modified jet momentum number, two new flow numbers and three expressions of jet momentum ratio were investigated. A total number of 25 numerical experiments under isothermal flow conditions with four different geometrical arrangements (labelled A-D) were performed. The correlation equations derived from CFD were compared with those obtained from experi mental studies. It is found that the jet momentum ratio RM2 gives the equation with the best correlation coefficient and so is recommended for ventilation design.}

abstract = {McShane et al.’s (2024) wide-ranging critique of null hypothesis significance testing provides a number of specific suggestions for improved practice in empirical research. This commentary amplifies several of these from the perspective of computational statistics—particularly nonparametrics, resampling/bootstrapping, and Bayesian methods—applied to common research problems. Throughout, the author emphasizes estimation (as opposed to testing) and uncertainty quantification through a comprehensive process of “curating” a variety of graphical and tabular evidence. Specifically, researchers should be encouraged to estimate the quantities that matter, with as few assumptions as possible, in multiple ways, then try to visualize it all, documenting their pathway from data to results for others to follow.}

abstract = {The development of a real-time driving simulator involves highly complex integrated and interdependent subsystems that require a large amount of computational time. When advanced hardware is unavailable for economic reasons, achieving real-time simulation is challenging, and thus delays are inevitable. Moreover, computational delays in the response of driving simulator subsystems reduce the fidelity of the simulation. In this paper, we propose a technique to decrease computational delays in a driving simulator. We used approximation techniques, sensitivity analysis, decomposition, and sampling techniques to develop a surrogate-based vehicle dynamic model (SBVDM). This global surrogate model can be used in place of the conventional vehicle dynamic model to reduce the computational burden while maintaining an acceptable accuracy. Our results showed that the surrogate model can significantly reduce computing costs compared to the computationally expensive conventional model. In addition, the response time of the SBVDM is nearly five times faster than the original simulation codes. Also, as a method to reduce hardware cost, the SBVDM was used and the results showed that most of the responses were accurate and acceptable in relation to longitudinal and lateral dynamics. Based on the results, the authors suggested that the proposed framework could be useful for developing low-cost vehicle simulation systems that require fast computational output.}

abstract = {Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) operation for coronary artery disease with different types of grafts has a large clinical application world wide. Immediately after this operation patients are usually relieved of their chest pain and have improved cardiac function. However, after a while, these bypass grafts may fail due to for example, neointimal hyperplasia or thrombosis. One of the causes for this bypass graft failure is assumed to be the blood flow with low wall shear stress. The aim of this research is to estimate the wall shear stress in a graft and thus to locate areas were wall shear stress is low. This was done with the help of a blood flow computer model. Postoperative biplane angiograms of the graft were recorded, and from these the three-dimensional geometry of the graft was reconstructed and imported into the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program FLUENT. The stationary diastolic flow through the grafts was calculated, and the wall shear stress distribution was estimated. This procedure was carried out for one native vessel and two different types of bypass grafts. One bypass graft was a saphenous vein and the other one was a varicose saphenous vein encased in a fine, flexible metal mesh. The mesh was attached to give the graft a defined diameter. The computational results show that each graft has distinct areas of low wall shear stress. The graft with the metal mesh has an area of low wall shear stress (< 1 Pa, stationary flow), which is four times smaller than the respective areas in the other graft and in the native vessel. This is thought to be caused by the smaller and more uniform diameter of the metal mesh-reinforced graft.}

abstract = {Abstract The topics of verification and validation have increasingly been discussed in the field of computational biomechanics, and many recent articles have applied these concepts in an attempt to build credibility for models of complex biological systems. Verification and validation are evolving techniques that, if used improperly, can lead to false conclusions about a system under study. In basic science, these erroneous conclusions may lead to failure of a subsequent hypothesis, but they can have more profound effects if the model is designed to predict patient outcomes. While several authors have reviewed verification and validation as they pertain to traditional solid and fluid mechanics, it is the intent of this paper to present them in the context of computational biomechanics. Specifically, the task of model validation will be discussed, with a focus on current techniques. It is hoped that this review will encourage investigators to engage and adopt the verification and validation process in an effort to increase peer acceptance of computational biomechanics models.}

abstract = {Politics is an area that is traditionally believed to be gender divided. According to intergroup communication theory, this gender-salient context might cause differences in political communications between genders. Moreover, the internet and social media, which creates a computer-mediated interactive context, might also impact the traditional gender discrepancies in political discourse. This study used Twitter trace-data and computational text analysis to examine such suppositions. By analyzing over one million tweets, we found that compared to men, women generally had a stronger sense of group awareness and cohesion and showed a desire to promote their tweets while avoiding addressing other users in political discussions. Women also focused on family- and home-related issues more than men did. These findings suggest that Twitter is not an ideal public sphere where differences and inequalities are eliminated, but it might be a counter-public sphere that promotes the voices and increases the publicity of marginalized groups.}

abstract = {Mixing and combustion of engine combustion network Spray A after end of injection are modeled using highly resolved multidimensional numerical simulations to explore the physics underlying recent experimental observations of combustion recession. Reacting spray simulations are performed using a traditional Lagrangian–Eulerian coupled formulation for two-phase mixture transport with a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes approach using the open-source computational fluid dynamics code OpenFOAM. Chemical kinetics models for n-dodecane by Cai et al. and Yao et al. are deployed to evaluate the impact of mechanism formulation and low-temperature chemistry on predictions of combustion recession behavior. Simulations with the Cai mechanism show that under standard Spray A conditions, the end-of-injection transient induces second-stage ignition in distinct regions near the nozzle that are initially spatially separated from the lifted diffusion flame, but then rapidly merge with flame. By contrast, the Yao mechanism fails to predict sufficient low-temperature chemistry in mixtures upstream of the diffusion flame during the end-of-injection transient and does not predict combustion recession for the same conditions. The effects of the shape and duration of the end-of-injection transient on the entrainment wave near the nozzle, the likelihood of combustion recession, and the spatiotemporal development of mixing and chemistry in near-nozzle mixtures are also investigated. With a more rapid ramp-down injection profile (ramp-down duration < 400 µs), a weaker combustion recession occurs earlier in time after the start of ramp-down. For extremely fast ramp-down (ramp-down duration = 0), the entrainment flux varies rapidly near the nozzle and over-leaning of the mixture completely suppresses combustion recession. For a slower ramp-down profile with respect to the standard Spray A condition, complete combustion recession back toward the nozzle is observed and combustion recession occurred later in time. Simulations qualitatively agreed with the past experimental and modeling observations of combustion recession with different end-of-injection transients.}

abstract = {The paper seeks to lay open the computational logic by which reality is rendered as information. Computation is claimed to involve a drift away from the palpable and extendible character of things, a trend that both continues and breaks with the prevailing strategies of technological mediation in industrialism and modernity. Computation entails the relentless analytic reduction of the composite character and complexion of the world. Reality is meticulously dissolved and regained after a long analytic retreat and technological reconstruction. The outcome of this analytic strategy is that processes taking place at the human-technology interface are sustained by an elaborate vertical stratification, entailing a variety of other programmes and systems that reach down from the level of the interface to machine language and the mechanics of binary parsing. The deepening involvement of computation in instrumental settings thus reframes the perceptive and action modalities by which human agents confront the world. This way, a coherent set of techniques for building up reality is established accompanied by a new model of human agency that increasingly takes the form of a combinatoria of data and information items, remaking the shape of things out of the digital fragments produced by computation.}

Methods: True lumen (TL)/false lumen (FL) dimensional changes, changes in total pressure (TP), and wall shear stress (WSS) were evaluated at follow-up (FU) compared to initial examination (IE) with transient CFD simulation with geometries derived from clinical image data and inflow boundary conditions from magnetic resonance images. The TL/FL pressure gradient between ascending and descending aorta (DAo) and maximum WSS at the site of largest dilatation was compared to values for the healthy aorta. Results: Hemodynamic changes at site of largest FL dilatation included 77% WSS reduction and 69% TP reduction. Compared to the healthy aorta, pressure gradient between ascending and DAo was a factor of 1.4 higher in the TL and a factor of 1.5 in the FL and increased at FU (1.6 and 1.7, respectively). Maximum WSS at the site of largest dilatation was a factor of 3 lower than that for the healthy aorta at IE and decreased by more than a factor of 2 at FU. Conclusions: The FL dilatation at FU favorably reduced TP. In contrast, unfavorable increase in pressure gradient between ascending and DAo was observed with higher values than in the healthy aorta. Maximum WSS was reduced at the site of largest dilation compared to healthy aorta.}

I outline the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of this approach, which is still under development, and show how it can be used to surface situations from large data sets derived from online platforms such as YouTube. Situational analytics extends to computationally-mediated settings a qualitative methodology developed by Adele Clarke, Situational Analysis (2005), which uses data mapping to detect heterogeneous entities in fieldwork data to determine ‘what makes a difference’ in a situation. Situational analytics scales up this methodology to analyse situations latent in computational data sets with semi-automated methods of textual and visual analysis. I discuss how this approach deviates from recent analyses of situations in computational social science, and argue that Clarke’s framework renders tractable a fundamental methodological problem that arises in this area of research: while social researchers turn to computational settings in order to analyse social life, the social processes unfolding in these envirnoments are fundamentally affected by the computational architectures in which they occur. Situational analytics offers a way to address this problematic by making a heterogeneously composed situation – involving social, technical and media elements – the unit of computational analysis. To conclude, I show how situational analytics can be applied in a case study of YouTube videos featuring intelligent vehicles and discuss how situational analysis itself needs to be elaborated if we are to come to terms with computational transformations of the situational fabric of social life.}

abstract = {Interfacial phenomena between the wafer and the polishing pad during chemical mechanical polishing are an area of great interest as they affect post-chemical mechanical polishing wafer topographies. Traditionally, the Reynolds equation has been used to predict the fluid pressure between the wafer and the polishing pad. However, with computational fluid dynamics it is possible to predict the fluid pressure and obtain insight into the fluid motion at the leading edge and trailing edge of the wafer. Additionally, computational fluid dynamics allows for the added ability to increase the resolution of the fluid physics to the asperity scale. In this study, a model is developed to predict phenomena related to mixed lubrication chemical mechanical polishing using computational fluid dynamics. Contact mechanics between the wafer and the pad are resolved through a Winkler elastic foundation formulation. The wafer is mounted on a ball joint which allows free rotation to occur. Friction between the wafer and the polishing pad causes the wafer to assume a position which produces a sub-ambient pressure distribution similar to that obtained from experiments. The effects of different table speeds on the interfacial fluid pressure, as predicted by the computational fluid dynamics are presented.}

It relies on part-to-whole theories from aesthetics and cognitive psychology. A survey of a group of people on preferences of images is held to record an average hedonic response (AHR). CV algorithms MSER and SAM recognize parts in images. Birkhoff’s aesthetic measure formula is adapted by employing the number of parts and their connections. These quantities are used as input layers of an ANN, and the AHR is the target output. The ANN evaluates images to output a predicted hedonic response (PHR), which is tested as a criterion in parametric design space navigation and in mapping the latent space of GANs. We conclude that such a framework is a heuristic method for better understanding the design and latent spaces and exploring designs.}

abstract = {Conflict management is one of the most important issues in leveraging organizational competitiveness. However, traditional social scientists built theories or models in this area which were mostly expressed in words and diagrams are insufficient. Social science research based on computational modeling and simulation is beginning to augment traditional theory building. Simulation provides a method for people to try their actions out in a way that is cost effective, faster, appropriate, flexible, and ethical. In this paper, a computational simulation model for conflict management in team building is presented. The model is designed and used to explore the individual performances related to the combination of individuals who have a range of conflict handling styles, under various types of resources and policies. The model is developed based on agent-based modeling method. Each of the agents has one of the five conflict handling styles: accommodation, compromise, competition, contingency, and learning. There are three types of scenarios: normal, convex, and concave. There are two types of policies: no policy, and a reward and punishment policy. Results from running the model are also presented. The simulation has led us to derive two implications concerning conflict management. First, a concave type of resource promotes competition, while convex type of resource promotes compromise and collaboration. Second, the performance ranking of different styles can be influenced by introducing different policies. On the other hand, it is possible for us to promote certain style by introducing different policies.}

abstract = {In musicology, there has been a long debate about a meaningful partitioning and description of music history regarding composition styles. Particularly, concepts of historical periods have been criticized since they cannot account for the continuous and interwoven evolution of style. To systematically study this evolution, large corpora are necessary suggesting the use of computational strategies. This article presents such strategies and experiments relying on a dataset of 2000 audio recordings, which cover more than 300 years of music history. From the recordings, we extract different tonal features. We propose a method to visualize these features over the course of history using evolution curves. With the curves, we re-trace hypotheses concerning the evolution of chord transitions, intervals, and tonal complexity. Furthermore, we perform unsupervised clustering of recordings across composition years, individual pieces, and composers. In these studies, we found independent evidence of historical periods that broadly agrees with traditional views as well as recent data-driven experiments. This shows that computational experiments can provide novel insights into the evolution of styles.}

abstract = {Hydrodynamic effects of mussel farms have attracted increased research attentions in recent years. The understanding of the hydrodynamic impacts is essential for predicting the sustainability of mussel farms. A large mussel farm includes thousands of mussel droppers, and the combined drag on the mussel droppers is sufficient to possibly affect the longevity of the entire long-lines. This article intends to study the drag and wake of an individual long-line mussel dropper using computational fluid dynamics approaches. Two equivalent rough cylinders, namely, Curved-Model and Sharp-Model, have been utilized to simulate the mussel dropper, and each rough cylinder is assigned with surface roughness. The porosity is not considered in this article due to its complexity from inhalant and exhalant of mussels. Two-dimensional laminar simulations are conducted at Reynolds number from 10 to 200, and three-dimensional large eddy simulations are conducted at subcritical Reynolds number ranging from 3900 to . The results show that larger drag coefficients and Strouhal numbers are attributed to surface roughness and sharp crowns on the rough cylinder. The obtained drag coefficient ranges from 1.1 to 1.2 with respect to the diameter of the mussel dropper and the peak value of the tidal velocities. Wakes behind rough cylinders fluctuate more actively compared to those of smooth cylinders. This research work provides new insight for further investigations on hydrodynamic interactions between fluid and mussel droppers.}
