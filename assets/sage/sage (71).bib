abstract = {In recent years, impact-resistant structures are highly sought after in various fields such automotive and aerospace applications as they proved notable performances, garnering significant success. The aim of this study is to assess the behavior of the 3D-printable honeycombs subjected to low velocity impact, for providing insights into absorbed energy for different core designs: hexagonal, auxetic, and rectangular, considering an equal number of cells across all designs. This work reports the computational and experimental studies conducted for sandwich structures under different impact loading. The experimental impact tests are carried out using a drop weight impact-testing machine. The examined specimen comprises two face-sheets and architected cell core fabricated through the Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) process made of polylactic acid (PLA). Variations in the geometric design of the cells result in the formation of cores with auxetic and non-auxetic topologies. Uniaxial tensile tests are performed to identify the mechanical properties of the involved biopolymer. The second attempt consists on comparing three architectural core structures under impact test using experimental and computational methods. Our findings highlight the specific influence of core topology on energy absorption in 3D-printed sandwich structures. Results indicate that while all three configurations (hexagonal, re-entrant, and rectangular) demonstrate comparable energy absorption values, the specific mechanisms and efficiencies vary, with re-entrant cores exhibiting distinct behaviors under impact.}

abstract = {We combined established psychological measures with techniques in machine learning to measure changes in gender stereotypes over the course of the 20th century as expressed in large-scale historical natural language data. Although our analysis replicated robust gender biases previously documented in the literature, we found that the strength of these biases has diminished over time. This appears to be driven by changes in gender biases for stereotypically feminine traits (rather than stereotypically masculine traits) and changes in gender biases for personality-related traits (rather than physical traits). Our results illustrate the dynamic nature of stereotypes and show how recent advances in data science can be used to provide a long-term historical analysis of core psychological variables. In terms of practice, these findings may, albeit cautiously, suggest that women and men can be less constrained by prescriptions of feminine traits.

abstract = {Abstract This paper investigated the biomechanics of two clinical cases of bone fracture treatments. Both fractures were treated with the same locking compression plate but with different numbers of screws as well as different plate materials. The fracture treated with 12 screws (rigid fixation) failed at 7 weeks with the plate breaking; the fracture with six screws (flexible fixation) endured the entire healing process. It was hypothesized that the plate failure in the unsuccessful case was due to the material fatigue induced by stress concentration in the plate. As the two clinical cases had different fracture locations and different plate materials, finite element simulations were undertaken for each fractured bone fixed by both a rigid and a flexible method. This enabled comparisons to be made between the rigid and flexible fixation methods. The fatigue life was assessed for each fixation method. The results showed that the stress in the rigid fixation methods could be significantly higher than that in flexible fixation methods. The fatigue analyses showed that, with the stress level in flexible fixation (i.e. with fewer screws), the plate was able to endure 2000 days, and that the plate in rigid fixation could fail by fatigue fracture in 20 days. The paper concludes that the rigid fixation method resulted in serious stress concentrations in the plate, which induced fatigue failure. The flexible fixation gave sufficient stability and was better for fracture healing.}

abstract = {Idea generation is an important component of most major theories of writing. However, few studies have linked idea generation in writing samples to assessments of writing quality or examined links between linguistic features in a text and idea generation. This study uses human ratings of idea generation, such as idea fluency, idea flexibility, idea originality, and idea elaboration, to analyze the extent to which idea generation relates to human judgments of essay quality in a corpus of college student essays. In conjunction with this analysis, linguistic features extracted from the essays are used to develop a predictive model of idea generation to further understand relations between the language features in an essay and the idea generation scores assigned to that essay. The results indicate that essays rated as containing a greater number of ideas that were flexible, original, and elaborated were judged to be of higher quality. Two of these features (elaboration and originality) were significant predictors of essay quality scores in a regression analysis that explained 33% of the variance in human scores. The results also indicate that idea generation is strongly linked to language features in essays. Specifically, the use of unique multiword units, more difficult words, semantic but not lexical similarities between paragraphs, and fewer word repetitions explained 80% of the variance in human scores of idea generation. These results have implications for writing theories and writing practice.}

abstract = {In this paper, the effect of co-firing semi-coke in a 300 MW tangentially fired boiler was numerically investigated. The results indicate that the incomplete combustion heat loss and NOx emission both increase with semi-coke co-fired ratio. Semi-coke may be injected into the furnace at a different height, which can lead to different thermal efficiency and NOx emission. It is suggested that semi-coke should not be fed from the top or bottom layer burners, since this could give rise to high carbon content respectively in fly ash and bottom slag. In addition, injecting semi-coke from the top burners could significantly increase the NOx emission. Under 1/2 co-firing ratio, the optimal fuel allocation is that feeding semi-coke from the B, D, and E layer burners. The growth in semi-coke particle size could increase the unburned carbon loss and NOx emission. It is highly recommended to reduce the unburned carbon loss under semi-coke co-fired condition by increasing the stoichiometric ratio of primary air for semi-coke. As it is increased from 0.25 to 0.3, the combustion efficiency of the co-fired condition is 99.47%, the same as when only firing bituminous coal, and the NOx emission is about 30% higher.}

abstract = {The constant emphasis on specialization produces university graduates who do not or cannot look at problems broadly. As a result, engineers, scientists and executives—indeed graduates in all fields—including the supposedly broad-based humanities—often cannot solve problems that require knowledge outside of their specializations. Or their narrowness causes them to commit embarrassing blunders that could be avoided if they took a broader view. The case of the British Westland Lysander P12 Ground Strafer aircraft illustrates the problem of narrow thinking. Very little direct information is available on this ingenious but obscure prototype airplane, but by examining many peripheral matters we can determine not only why the P12 was built but also how it was built. Further, we can also determine why it failed. Had the initial designers approached the problem in a broad way, and using information that was then available, they would have seen in advance that the project would fail. The case is instructive as an industrial problem, but it also demonstrates the value of global thinking methodology.}

abstract = {Schools around the globe increasingly realized the importance of technology and its application in the education system. To guarantee a successful educational innovation, schools seek out different parties for valuable opinions. Among them, parents are the important feedback providers, because their attitudes are influential on children’s academic performance. Moreover, their involvement and support are considered the key factor that facilitates an effective implementation of programming education at schools. This study aimed at developing and validating an instrument measuring parents’ perceptions of programming education among P-12 schools in Hong Kong. We propose that parents’ perceptions of programming education is a multidimensional construct which constitutes (a) understanding, (b) support, and (c) expectation. In total, 524 questionnaires were collected from the parents who attended programming workshops and seminars. Exploratory factor analysis shows evidence for the three-dimensional construct. Confirmatory factor analysis reconfirms the measurement structure. Implications of the study are discussed.}

We review the available faultline measures with regard to their properties and identify several limitations, including dealing with more than two subgroups. We thus propose a new cluster-based approach, average silhouette width (ASW), that identifies the number of subgroups and subgroup membership. We then compare the measures with 1,400 simulated teams with varying properties and investigate their factor structure and their behavior under missing values. We also investigate the predictive validity of the measures with data from real work teams. Results show that different measures respond to different team features in different ways but that most of them load on two correlated factors. Taken together, the ASW measure had the most favorable attributes and was the only measure that accurately determined subgroup membership in the presence of more than two subgroups. We discuss limitations and further research opportunities pertaining to faultline measures and provide software for calculating all investigated measures at http://www.group-faultlines.org.}

In addition, the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on the possible changes is investigated. Fifteen OSAS patients and 15 healthy controls joined two full-night polysomnographies, including a computational measure of deep sleep percentage (DS%) bilaterally from the frontal, central and occipital channels, and a neuropsychological assessment. After a 6-month CPAP the patients underwent one more full-night polysomnography with computational DS% analysis and a neuropsychological assessment. At the baseline, the OSAS patients had poorer performance in the Picture Completion, in the Digit Symbol and in copying the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (ROCFT) compared to the controls. The patients also showed reduced DS% in all 6 electrographic (EEG) channels compared to controls. The patients had an inter-hemispheric difference showing less deep sleep in the right hemisphere than in the left hemisphere both frontopolarly and centrally, while the controls showed this inter-hemispheric difference only frontopolarly. After CPAP the patients still had poorer performance in the Picture Completion and in the ROCFT. The patients continued to show reduced DS% in all 3 channels of the right hemisphere and occipitally in the left hemisphere, also the inter-hemispheric difference frontopolarly and centrally remained. OSAS patients have mild visually based cognitive dysfunction and reduced amount of deep sleep in the right hemisphere even after CPAP.}

We present the results obtained from a systematic review of the literature. The purpose was to map the employment of the computational technology in ABA interventions, as well as to discuss the primary technologies used, their benefits, and their limitations. Based on our review, we noticed that technology-based interventions are in the early stages of development. We evidenced it by the methodological limitations in many of the studies we found, and the relatively simplistic nature of many of the technological applications (e.g. inability to customize the software to meet individual learner needs). We also provide suggestions, based on these findings, for how researchers may advance the studies in this area to improve the lives of children with ASD and their families.}

abstract = {Constructive matching and response elimination strategies are two primarily used cognitive strategies in Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM), a valid measurement instrument of general intelligence. Identifying strategies is necessary for conducting studies on the relationship between cognitive strategy and other cognitive factors and for cognitive strategy training. However, the strategy identification method used in research is either subjective, or the information in the behavior data is not fully utilized, or it is limited by the size of the sample and cannot be widely used. Therefore, this study trained a convolutional neural network-based visual computational model (CVC) for cognitive strategy identification based on eye movement images. Focusing on the APM, the trained CVC can be used for strategy identification by learning and mining the pattern information in the eye movement images with predefined training labels from a psychometric model. An empirical study was conducted to illustrate the training and application of the CVC. Utilizing the trained CVC and a developed graphical user interface application, the primary finding of the study reveals a high level of agreement in strategy identification between the CVC and the psychometric model, as well as between the CVC and expert judgment. This implies that, akin to the psychometric model, the CVC can be used to identify the two cognitive strategies of constructive matching and response elimination. Overall, the proposed deep learning-based model follows the data-driven perspective and provides a new way of studying cognitive strategy in the APM by presenting objective and quantitative identification results.}

abstract = {Complicated flowfields near casing in a transonic axial flow compressor rotor have been numerically investigated in this paper. Two vortex identification methods, namely the Eigenvector Method and Lambda 2 Method, are introduced as important tools for the graphical representation of the concentrated vortices arising from tip leakage flow and blade boundary layer separation. The analysis of the numerical results reveals that multiple tip vortices whose development are dependent on the variation of shock wave configuration are observed at conditions around the peak efficiency point. However, with the decrease of the massflow rate, only the well-known tip leakage vortex and the second tip vortex are left in the tip region due to the disappearance of the second shock wave. Then when the massflow rate further decreases to the stall limit, an deceleration flow region emerges downstream of the shock wave due to an increasing interaction between the first shock wave and the well-known tip leakage vortex. The tip leakage vortex further experiences a bubble-type and then spiral-type breakdown at near stall flow conditions. In addition, the validity of the two vortex identification methods is also discussed in this paper. It is found that both methods are able to identify and accentuate the concentrated streamwise vortices near casing when a vortex is not disrupted. However, if the vortex breakdown occurs, only Eigenvector Method can describe the breakdown region in a deep view.}

abstract = {Three arrangement types of fibrous media have been established including “Mesh” (layered distribution), “Para” (unidirectional distribution), and “Nurbs” (random distribution), with fiber diameters ranging from 5 to 7 µm and solid volume fractions ranging from 14.58% to 21.95%. To describe the filtration performance, particles trajectories, and the influence of structural parameters of fibrous media, the computation fluid dynamics is adopted. The filtration efficiency and the pressure drop of fibrous media are calculated in computation fluid dynamics and semi-analytical model. It is found that the arrangement types have significant effects on the filtration efficiency and show the limitation of the semi-analytical model. With the Stokes number larger than 1, the numerical results and semi-analytical model have great consistency in the filtration efficiency for the “Mesh” and “Para” types than “Nurbs” type. Meanwhile, the pressure drop between the numerical results and the semi-analytical model is always consistent.}
