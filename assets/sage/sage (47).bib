abstract = {The major objective of this study is to develop a computational fatigue test method for welded structures. The damage mechanics approach is used to derive explicit expressions for fatigue life estimation within the framework of continuum mechanics. Microdamage model is applied to calculate the quasi-brittle material damage prior to the crack initiation. Based on the two-scale model, that is, micro versus meso (macro) scale linkage scheme is implemented in conjunction with finite element method to describe the crack initiation or propagation. For the material damage model used at microscale, a finite element code is developed. Lemaitre’s unified damage model and constitutive equation were chosen so as to ensure the efficiency for developing finite element algorithm. Identification method for material parameters required to constitutive equation is proposed using inversion of Ramberg-Osgood type constitutive model. In order to consider weld-induced residual stresses, the Ueda’s inherent strain scheme is incorporated into the calculation of residual stresses. Computational procedure based on two-scale model with the use of commercial finite element code is successfully constructed. The numerical results obtained by proposed method are compared with experimental results for validation.}

abstract = {Introduction: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit performance can be compromised by oxygenator thrombosis. Stagnant blood flow in the oxygenator can increase the risk of thrombus formation. To minimize thrombogenic potential, computational fluid dynamics is frequently applied for identification of stagnant flow conditions. We investigate the use of computed tomography angiography to identify flow patterns associated with thrombus formation. Methods: A computed tomography angiography was performed on a Quadrox D oxygenator, and video densitometric parameters associated with flow stagnation were measured from the acquired videos. Computational fluid dynamics analysis of the same oxygenator was performed to establish computational fluid dynamics–based flow characteristics. Forty-one Quadrox D oxygenators were sectioned following completion of clinical use. Section images were analyzed with software to determine oxygenator clot burden. Linear regression was used to correlate clot burden to computed tomography angiography and computational fluid dynamics–based flow characteristics. Results: Clot burden from the explanted oxygenators demonstrated a well-defined pattern, with the largest clot burden at the corner opposite the blood inlet and outlet. The regression model predicted clot burden by region of interest as a function of time to first opacification on computed tomography angiography (R2 = 0.55). The explanted oxygenator clot burden map agreed well with the computed tomography angiography predicted clot burden map. The computational fluid dynamics parameter of residence time, when summed in the Z-direction, was partially predictive of clot burden (R2 = 0.35). Conclusion: In the studied oxygenator, clot burden follows a pattern consistent with clinical observations. Computed tomography angiography–based flow analysis provides a useful adjunct to computational fluid dynamics–based flow analysis in understanding oxygenator thrombus formation.}

abstract = {Abstract This study was carried out to assess the ability of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code to predict the scavenging flow in the transfer duct of a two-stroke cycle engine. A two-stroke cycle engine was modified to allow laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) measurements to be made in one transfer duct. It was operated under motoring conditions at 500r/min with a delivery ratio of 0.7. Predictions were obtained from a dynamic CFD simulation of the flow within the cylinder, transfer duct and a portion of the exhaust duct. Boundary conditions for the CFD model were obtained from experimentally measured pressure-time histories in the crankcase and exhaust. A comparison of measured and predicted transfer duct axial velocities at various locations within the duct showed that the CFD model could replicate the general trend of the flow but not the details. From the LDV measurements and CFD predictions, velocity oscillations were observed between the end of crankcase blowdown and transfer port closing. A one-dimensional general engine simulation package was used to investigate the gas dynamic activity in the transfer duct. It was found that the observed oscillations were due to pressure wave reflections in the transfer duct. The general trend of the axial velocity profile in the transfer duct was well replicated by the one-dimensional simulation as were the exhaust and crankcase pressures.}

abstract = {Computational brain models use machine learning, algorithms and statistical models to harness big data for delivering disease-specific diagnosis or prognosis for individuals. While intended to support clinical decision-making, their translation into clinical practice remains challenging despite efforts to improve implementation through training clinicians and clinical staff in their use and benefits. Drawing on the specific case of neurology, we argue that existing implementation efforts are insufficient for the responsible translation of computational models. Our research based on a collective seven-year engagement with the Human Brain Project, participant observation at workshops and conferences, and expert interviews, suggests that relationships of trust between clinicians and researchers (modellers, data scientists) are essential to the meaningful translation of computational models. In particular, efforts to increase model transparency, strengthen upstream collaboration, and integrate clinicians’ perspectives and tacit knowledge have the potential to reinforce trust building and increase translation of technologies that are beneficial to patients.}

abstract = {This paper proposes an innovative enriched second-order multi-scale (SOMS) computational method to simulate and analyze the nonlocal thermoelastic problems of blend composites with stress and heat flux gradient behaviors. The multiple periodical heterogeneities and periodic configurations of investigated blend composites in different substructures result in a huge computational cost for direct numerical simulations. The significant characteristics of this study are as follows. (1) The nonlocal properties of blend composites in constitutive equations are converted into the source terms of thermoelastic balance equations. The novel macro-micro coupled SOMS computational model for these transformed nonlocal multi-scale problems is derived on the basis of multi-scale asymptotic analysis. The nonlocal thermoelastic behaviors of blend composites can be merely uncovered in the enriched SOMS solutions. (2) The error analysis in the pointwise sense is presented to elucidate the importance and necessity of establishing the enriched SOMS solutions. Furthermore, an explicit error estimate for the SOMS approximate solutions is obtained in the integral sense for these nonlocal multi-scale problems. (3) A multi-scale numerical algorithm is presented to effectively simulate nonlocal thermoelastic problems of blend composites based on finite element method (FEM). Finally, the capability of the proposed enriched SOMS computational method is demonstrated by typical two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) blend composites, presenting not only the excellent numerical accuracy but also the less computational cost. This work proposes a unified multi-scale computational framework for enabling nonlocal thermoelastic behavior analysis of blend composites.}

From the vast number of applications where CFD has proven to be an important help to the design engineer, two examples have been chosen for a detailed discussion. The first example gives a comparison of experimental data and 3D Euler and 3D Navier-Stokes results for the flow in a Francis runner. The second example highlights the state-of-the-art of predicting the performance of an entire Francis turbine by means of numerical simulation.}

abstract = {Water-lubricated bearings have attracted increasing attention in the field of high-speed machine tools for their low friction due to low viscosity. However, new problems, in particular, insufficient load capacity, are on the way. To the point, groove-textured journal bearing is adopted in this study. Aiming at investigating the effects of groove texture on high speed, water-lubricated, hydrodynamic journal bearing precisely, and thoroughly, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic analyses considering cavitation and turbulence are undertaken to assess the tribological performances of the bearing. To reduce the amount of three-dimensional modeling and meshing work, mesh deformation is presented. The numerical results are compared with experiments to verify the validity of the present models and calculation procedures. Pressure distribution, load capacity, and friction of groove-textured water-lubricated journal bearing are analyzed with respect to operating conditions and geometric parameters. Comparisons between groove-textured water-lubricated journal bearing and smooth bearing are carried out to find out the influence of groove texture. It is found that the groove texture can achieve a remarkable improvement of load capacity at a smaller eccentricity ratio and higher rotary speed. The load capacity is affected by the combined effects of groove depth, width, and length. However, generally, the friction force of water-lubricated journal bearing is slightly influenced by groove texture. Results can provide theoretical guidance for the optimal design of groove-textured water-lubricated journal bearing under different operating parameters.}

abstract = {There has been limited use of ceramic materials for all-ceramic posterior bridges. Major reasons are the low strength, the strength scatter, and the time-dependent strength decrease of ceramics due to slow crack growth. The objective of this study was to predict the long-term failure probability and loading capability of all-ceramic bridges (Empress 1, Empress 2, In-Ceram Alumina, and ZrO2) by computational techniques. The lifetimes of different bridge model designs were predicted by means of the NASA post-processor CARES. Bridges made of zirconia showed a very high mechanical long-term reliability. Empress I and InCeram Alumina seem to be insufficient as posterior bridge materials based on this prediction. The lifetime of the all-ceramic bridges can be significantly increased by improving the design in the connector area. We conclude that computational techniques can help to judge a ceramic material and a specific ceramic bridge design with respect to mechanical reliability before clinical use.}

The approach is developed by integrating a three-dimensional body force model of multistage compressors and a classical two-dimensional parallel engine model. The internal flow field of a high bypass ratio turbofan engine under different forms of total pressure distortion is simulated by the model. The simulations are discussed in depth to reveal the features of the distorted flow field in the compression components under the whole engine environment. The relationship between the overall performance of the engine and the intensity of inlet total pressure distortion is investigated quantitatively. It is evident that the mixed-fidelity model has the capability to quantitatively evaluate the effect of complex inlet distortion on the performance and the internal flow field of engines with low computational costs.}

Overall, the Thom partial boiling approach was found to be the most representative of the three considered. However, numerous issues were found to be evident whatever approach was adopted and these are discussed in the paper.

In such a case the scattering from the sample is much smaller than that of the pressure cell. Monte Carlo Ray tracing in MCViNE was used to model scattering from a Si powder sample and the cell. A collimator was inserted into the simulation and the number and size of channels were optimized to maximize the rejection of the parasitic signal coming from the complex sample environment. Constraints, provided by the additive manufacturing process as well as a specific neutron diffractometer, were also included in the optimization.

abstract = {Individuals with autism spectrum disorder demonstrate narrative (i.e. storytelling) difficulties which can significantly impact their ability to form and maintain social relationships. However, existing research has not comprehensively documented these impairments in more open-ended, emotionally evocative situations common to daily interactions. Computational linguistic measures offer a promising complement to traditional hand-coding methods of narrative analysis and in this study were applied together with hand coding of narratives elicited with emotionally salient scenes from the Thematic Apperception Test. In total, 19 individuals with autism spectrum disorder and 14 typically developing controls were asked to tell stories about six images from the Thematic Apperception Test. Both structural and qualitative aspects of narrative were assessed using a hand-coding system and Latent Semantic Analysis, an automated computational measure of semantic similarity. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder demonstrated significant difficulties with the use of complex syntax to integrate their narratives and problems explaining characters’ intentions. These and other key narrative skills were strongly related to narrative competence scores derived from Latent Semantic Analysis, which also distinguished the autism spectrum disorder group from controls. Together, results underscore key narrative impairments in autism spectrum disorder and support the promise of Latent Semantic Analysis as a valuable tool for the quantitative assessment of complex language abilities.}

Solid Works renditions of external rear-view mirror models mounted on a reference luxury sedan were analysed using a commercially available computational fluid dynamic package ANSYS FLUENT. A different approach was followed to carry out the empirical flow visualisation and predict sound pressure levels. The aerodynamic characterisation of the vehicle was done utilising the widely used shear stress transport turbulence model, while the analysis of wind noise and the contributing vortices employed a large eddy simulation.

abstract = {Following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010, a substantial body of research has focused on the development of computational tools and analytical frameworks for modeling oil spill events. Much of this work is dedicated to deepening our understanding of the interactions between oil, fragile ecosystems, and the environment, as well as the impacts of oil on human settlements which are vulnerable to spill events. These advances in oil spill modeling and associated analytics have not only increased the efficiency of spill interdiction and mitigation efforts, they have also helped to nurture proactive, versus reactive, response strategies and plans for local and regional stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is to provide a progress report on the wide range of computational tools, analytical frameworks, and emerging technologies which are necessary inputs for a complete oil spill modeling package. Specifically, we explore the use of relatively mature tools, such as dedicated spill modeling packages, geographic information systems (GIS), and remote sensing, as well emerging technologies such as aerial and aquatic drones and other in-situ sensing technologies. The integration of these technologies and the advantages associated with using a geographic lens for oil spill modeling are discussed.}

Complementing each other, the techniques provide a reasonably objective method for classifying at least some traditional English dialect regions on the basis of characteristic features. The results largely corroborate standard presentations in the literature but differ in the placement of regional boundaries and identification of regional features, as well as in placing those systemic elements in a broader context of largely continuous and often random variation.}

abstract = {The author exemplifies the framework of PSI (Pervasive System for Indoor-GIS) for exploring the spatial model of dynamic human behavior and developing various services in an ubiquitous computational environment. This does not mean merely constructing a software framework; rather, it means attempting to establish an inclusive service framework for ubiquitous computing. The most advantageous aspect of this component-oriented framework is that it contributes toward developing various service applications for ubiquitous computation as the occasion demands. That is, service applications are expected to do modeling, simulation, monitoring, Web services, and other applications. The author also discusses the relative issues on making a coordinating bridge between behavioral sciences and multiagent systems.}

abstract = {In the present paper, two configurations of structured reactors (with and without) chimney tray placed below the packed bed have been investigated to study their effect on maldistribution factor and pressure drop characteristics. A simulation result based on a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics was involved using ANSYS Fluent. First, maldistribution factors without chimney tray were calculated and compared to the results taken from the literature. The results were found to be in good agreement with the experimental data of Yuan et al. Second, the reactor with a chimney tray was modeled in Fluent, and steady-state simulations were performed. The uniformity due to the turbulence of the fluid was carried out using different turbulence models, and the velocity profiles along the axial direction inside the reactor were obtained. As a result, the comparison shows that the presence of a chimney tray yields lower maldistribution factor enhancement by 23% compared to the conventional structured reactor under the same operating condition. The effect of the plate orientation is also determined, and it is found that the maximum pressure drop is achieved through the rows with an orientation angle of α = 45° up to 2.3% higher than of α = 0° and α = 90°.}

abstract = {A chaff cloud is an electronic countermeasure to radio frequency emitters. The cloud immerses a protected entity in a multitude of false targets by reradiating incident electromagnetic energy from millions of thin aluminized fibers, foil strips, or elements printed with conductive ink. The elements are cut to form resonant structures to match the principle threat frequencies, making them an effective reradiator. Empirically testing chaff clouds is technically challenging, costly, and time consuming. With an increased emphasis on chaff research comes the need to characterize cloud radar cross-section performance to expand existing knowledge and explore development opportunities for future technologies. This paper describes the computational methodology and results for analyzing standard dipole chaff clouds and Koch snowflakes as a possible new chaff element.}
