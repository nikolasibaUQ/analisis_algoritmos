abstract = {Emerging artificial intelligence techniques such as genetic algorithms (GAs) allow a more realistic representation and solution of difficult and combinatorial problems such as the dynamic traffic queue management problem. Computational experience in solving such complex large-scale problems by use of micro-GAs is described. In addition to providing evidence of the ability of micro-GAs to successfully identify optimal traffic management schemes, some micro-GA-associated computational issues that warrant attention are highlighted. Choosing a proper population size is a critical decision, and internal variability must be accounted for to assess the goodness of the optimization results properly. A simple rule for deciding the best population size for micro-GAs is proposed. Micro-GAs may converge to low-quality solutions, particularly with very small population sizes; convergence of micro-GAs by itself is not a sufficient indication of good performance. The size of the search space for some real-world systems can pose some difficulties to micro-GAs. Choosing between micro-GAs and regular GAs is a problem-dependent decision.}

This test requires a specification of the procedures to which the model applies, a sampling of procedures and response measures, and an objective way to determine the difficulty of discriminating the responses of the model from the responses of the animal. Scalar timing theory is used as an example of a well-developed computational theory of timing that involves addition, multiplication, division, and sampling. The behavioral theory of timing is used as an example of a well-developed associative theory of timing that involves state transitions and strengthening of connections.

abstract = {Abstract This study was carried out to assess the ability of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code to predict the scavenging flow in the transfer duct of a two-stroke cycle engine. A two-stroke cycle engine was modified to allow laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) measurements to be made in one transfer duct. It was operated under motoring conditions at 500r/min with a delivery ratio of 0.7. Predictions were obtained from a dynamic CFD simulation of the flow within the cylinder, transfer duct and a portion of the exhaust duct. Boundary conditions for the CFD model were obtained from experimentally measured pressure-time histories in the crankcase and exhaust. A comparison of measured and predicted transfer duct axial velocities at various locations within the duct showed that the CFD model could replicate the general trend of the flow but not the details. From the LDV measurements and CFD predictions, velocity oscillations were observed between the end of crankcase blowdown and transfer port closing. A one-dimensional general engine simulation package was used to investigate the gas dynamic activity in the transfer duct. It was found that the observed oscillations were due to pressure wave reflections in the transfer duct. The general trend of the axial velocity profile in the transfer duct was well replicated by the one-dimensional simulation as were the exhaust and crankcase pressures.}

abstract = {Current web-based visualizations are designed for single computers and cannot make use of additional devices on the client side, even if today’s users often have access to several, such as a tablet, a smartphone, and a smartwatch. We present a framework for ad hoc computational clusters that leverage these local devices for visualization computations. Furthermore, we present an instantiating JavaScript toolkit called VisHive for constructing web-based visualization applications that can transparently connect multiple devices—called cells—into such ad hoc clusters—called a hive—for local computation. Hives are formed either using a matchmaking service or through manual configuration. Cells are organized into a master–slave architecture, where the master provides the visual interface to the user and controls the slaves and the slaves perform computation. VisHive is built entirely using current web technologies, runs in the native browser of each cell, and requires no specific software to be downloaded on the involved devices. We demonstrate VisHive using four distributed examples: a text analytics visualization, a database query for exploratory visualization, a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise clustering running on multiple nodes, and a principal component analysis implementation.}

Transient temperature, the shape of the slowest heating zone (SHZ) during heating and the slowest cooling zone (SCZ) during cooling were presented and studied. The simulation covered the whole heating and cooling cycles of 3600s and 1200s durations, respectively. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code PHOENICS was used for this purpose. Saturated steam at 121°C and water at 20°C were assumed to be the heating and cooling media, respectively. The partial differential equations describing the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy were solved numerically using the finite volume method. The liquid food used in the simulation has a temperature-dependent viscosity and density. At the end of heating, the SHZ was found to have settled into a region within 30–40 per cent of the pouch height above the bottom and at a distance approximately 20–30 per cent of the pouch length from its deepest end. In the cooling cycle, the slowest cooling zone (SCZ) was found to develop in the core of the pouch and gradually migrate toward the widest end. The vertical location of this slowest cooling zone was about 60–70 per cent of the pouch height. Experimental validation has been performed by measuring the temperature distribution in the pouch during heating and cooling, using thermocouples fixed at different locations. The predicted results were in good agreement with those obtained from the experiments.}

abstract = {People who interact with graphs to perform arithmetic tasks typically employ quantitative features. However, they may employ the spatial metaphor under two alternative conditions: if they have been trained to apply visual arithmetic methods to traditional line and bar graphs, or if they interact with specially constructed and special-purpose computational graphics. Two experiments explored a visual arithmetic method used to train subjects to determine a mean by locating the spatial midpoint of a set of indicators (bars in a bar graph or points in a line graph). In Experiment 1 visual arithmetic subjects determined the mean of five indicators as quickly as they did the mean of two indicators; control subjects performed slower with five indicators. Both groups took more time to add the values of five indicators than to add two indicators. In Experiment 2, unlike control subjects, visual arithmetic subjects’ response times in mean trials were unaffected by changes in the y-axis scale. However, both groups were affected by the y-axis scale on addition trials. Neither group was influenced by changes in the distance between indicators. The discussion addresses the transfer of visual arithmetic training to tasks that differ from the one used during training, uses for visual arithmetic and computational graphics, and the role of parallel processing and task restructuring in visual arithmetic.}

The approach is developed by integrating a three-dimensional body force model of multistage compressors and a classical two-dimensional parallel engine model. The internal flow field of a high bypass ratio turbofan engine under different forms of total pressure distortion is simulated by the model. The simulations are discussed in depth to reveal the features of the distorted flow field in the compression components under the whole engine environment. The relationship between the overall performance of the engine and the intensity of inlet total pressure distortion is investigated quantitatively. It is evident that the mixed-fidelity model has the capability to quantitatively evaluate the effect of complex inlet distortion on the performance and the internal flow field of engines with low computational costs.}

I investigate an underexamined mechanism for this segregation: Charter schools project identities corresponding to parents’ race- and class-specific parenting styles and educational values. I use computational text analysis to detect the emphasis on inquiry-based learning in the websites of all charter schools operating in 2015–16. I then estimate mixed linear regression models to test the relationships between ideological emphasis and school- and district-level poverty and ethnicity. I thereby transcend methodological problems in scholarship on charter school identities by collecting contemporary, populationwide data and by blending text analysis with hypothesis testing. Findings suggest charter school identities are both race and class specific, outlining a new mechanism by which school choice may consolidate parents by race and class—and paving the way for behavioral and longitudinal studies. This project contributes to literatures on school choice and educational stratification.}

abstract = {Abstract Analysis of metabolic networks typically begins with construction of the stoichiometry matrix, which characterizes the network topology. This matrix provides, via the balance equation, a description of the potential steady-state flow distribution. This paper begins with the observation that the balance equation depends only on the structure of linear redundancies in the network, and so can be stated in a succinct manner, leading to computational efficiencies in steady-state analysis. This alternative description of steady-state behaviour is then used to provide a novel method for network reduction, which complements existing algorithms for describing intracellular networks in terms of input-output macro-reactions (to facilitate bioprocess optimization and control). Finally, it is demonstrated that this novel reduction method can be used to address elementary mode analysis of large networks: the modes supported by a reduced network can capture the input-output modes of a metabolic module with significantly reduced computational effort.}

abstract = {Background Patellar tendinopathy (jumper’s knee) is characterized by localized tenderness of the patellar tendon at its origin on the inferior pole of the patella and a characteristic increase in signal intensity on magnetic resonance imaging at this location. However, it is unclear why the lesion typically occurs in this area of the patellar tendon as surface strain gauge studies of the patellar tendon through the range of motion have produced conflicting results. Hypothesis The predicted patellar tendon strains that occur as a result of the tendon loads and patella-patellar tendon angles (PPTAs) experienced during a jump landing will be significantly increased in the area of the patellar tendon associated with patellar tendinopathy. Study Design Descriptive laboratory study. Methods A 2-dimensional, computational, finite element model of the patella-patellar tendon complex was developed using anatomic measurements taken from lateral radiographs of a normal knee. The patella was modeled with plane strain rigid elements, and the patellar tendon was modeled with 8-node plane strain elements with neo-Hookean material properties. A tie constraint was used to join the patellar tendon and patella. Patella-patellar tendon angles corresponding to knee flexion angles between 0° and 60° and patellar tendon strains ranging from 5% to 15% were used as input variables into the computational model. To determine if the location of increased strain predicted by the computational model could produce isolated tendon fascicle damage in that same area, 5 human cadaveric patella-patellar tendon-tibia specimens were loaded under conditions predicted by the model to significantly increase localized tendon strain. Pre- and posttesting ultrasound images of the patella–patellar tendon specimens were obtained to document the location of any injured fascicles. Results Localized tendon strain at the classic location of the jumper’s knee lesion was found to increase in association with an increase in the magnitude of applied patellar tendon strain and a decrease in the PPTA. The principal stresses and strains predicted by the model for this localized area were tensile and not compressive in nature. Applying the tendon strain conditions and PPTA predicted by the model to significantly increase localized strain resulted in disruption of tendon fascicles in 3 of the 5 cadaveric specimens at the classic location of the patellar tendinopathy lesion. Conclusion The localized increase in patellar tendon strain that occurs in response to the application of tendon loads and decreased PPTA could induce microdamage at the classic location of the jumper’s knee lesion. Clinical Relevance The association of decreasing PPTA with increasing localized tendon strain would implicate the role of knee-joint angle as well as tendon force in the etiopathogenesis of jumper’s knee.}

abstract = {Individuals with autism spectrum disorder demonstrate narrative (i.e. storytelling) difficulties which can significantly impact their ability to form and maintain social relationships. However, existing research has not comprehensively documented these impairments in more open-ended, emotionally evocative situations common to daily interactions. Computational linguistic measures offer a promising complement to traditional hand-coding methods of narrative analysis and in this study were applied together with hand coding of narratives elicited with emotionally salient scenes from the Thematic Apperception Test. In total, 19 individuals with autism spectrum disorder and 14 typically developing controls were asked to tell stories about six images from the Thematic Apperception Test. Both structural and qualitative aspects of narrative were assessed using a hand-coding system and Latent Semantic Analysis, an automated computational measure of semantic similarity. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder demonstrated significant difficulties with the use of complex syntax to integrate their narratives and problems explaining characters’ intentions. These and other key narrative skills were strongly related to narrative competence scores derived from Latent Semantic Analysis, which also distinguished the autism spectrum disorder group from controls. Together, results underscore key narrative impairments in autism spectrum disorder and support the promise of Latent Semantic Analysis as a valuable tool for the quantitative assessment of complex language abilities.}

Firstly, the fundamentals of the mechanics and physics of cutting processes are outlined. This is extended to friction and lubrication at the tool-workpiece interface and tool wear. On the basis of this quantitative knowledge, the interaction of tribology with a cutting process is demonstrated by means of computer simulation including machinability of free-cutting steels, cutting fluid action and prediction of tool wear. Finally, concluding remarks are devoted to the interaction of tribology with wider aspects of cutting towards the goal of ‘better machining‘.}

Another objective of this study was to consider the risk of airborne infection transmission, caused by undesirable transport and dispersion of exhaled pathogens to surrounding air when infected individual uses PV. Results show that calculation of personal exposure effectiveness would be sufficiently accurate to give proper information about the protection of occupant with a PV system also without the breathing simulation included.

Attentional scanning is controlled by bottom-up and top-down processes, with the effectiveness of top-down guidance varying as a function of SA. Information sampled by the low-level module is fed forward to the higher-level module for consolidation within a working memory representation of the pilot’s situation, with the quality of this representation reflecting the pilot’s level of SA.

abstract = {This article takes inspiration from Kittler’s claim that philosophy has neglected the means used for its production. Kittler’s argument for media ontology will be compared to the post-Kantian project of re-inventing philosophy through the medium of thought (in particular Deleuze’s Spiritual Automaton). The article discusses these views in the context of the automation of logical thinking where procedures, tasks, and functions are part of the instrumental processing of new ends evolving a new mode of reasoning. In particular, the article suggests that in constructivist logic and information theory, the temporal gap between truth and proof, between input and output, can be taken to argue that the means of thought expose the indetermination or the incomputability of proof. The automation of reasoning in logical processing coincides not with mindless correlations of data, replacing axioms with data, truths with self-validating proofs. Instead, the problem of the indeterminacy of proof within automated logic re-habilitates techne or instrumentality, and the relation between means and ends away from classical idealism and analytic realism. By following John Dewey’s argument for instrumentality, it will be argued that the task of thinking today needs to re-invent a logic of techne away from the teleological view of ends or the crisis of finality. If the post-Kantian preoccupations about the task of thinking already announced that the medium of thought could offer possibilities for a non-human philosophy (or a philosophy beyond truth), this article envisions a machine philosophy originating from within computational media.}

abstract = {How robust is a healthcare system? How does a patient navigate the system and what is the cost (e.g., number of medical services required or number of times the medical provider had to be changed to get access to the required medical services) incurred from the first symptoms to getting cured? How will it fare in the wake to a sudden epidemic or a disaster? How are all of these affected by administrative decisions such as allocating/diminishing resources in various areas or centralising services? These are the questions motivating our study on a formal prototype model for a healthcare system. We propose that a healthcare system can be understood as a distributed system with independent nodes (healthcare providers) computing according to their own resources and constraints, with tasks (patient needs) being allocated between the nodes. The questions about the healthcare system become in this context questions about resource availability and distribution between the nodes. We construct in this paper an Event-B model capturing the basic functionality of a simplified healthcare system: patients with different types of medical needs being allocated to suitable medical providers, and navigating between different providers for their turn for multi-step treatments.}

abstract = {The goal of the present work was to explore student perspectives about a course module designed with cognitivist and constructivist learning theories, the cognitive apprenticeship instructional model, and a T-shaped design, specifically the first module of a Computational Fluid Mechanics curricular unit within a Master of Computational Mechanics program. This module was redesigned accordingly after the professor participated in a faculty development course, Engineering Education Theory and Practice, at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto. Student perspectives on the efficacy of the redesigned course were solicited, along with those from students who had previously taken the course. Students who participated in the revised course module reported higher levels of satisfaction than students from the previous iteration of the course and were more likely to recognize the value of specific instructional activities. This paper describes the revision of the course module and a comparison of the student feedback before and after those revisions.}

abstract = {In the present paper, two configurations of structured reactors (with and without) chimney tray placed below the packed bed have been investigated to study their effect on maldistribution factor and pressure drop characteristics. A simulation result based on a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics was involved using ANSYS Fluent. First, maldistribution factors without chimney tray were calculated and compared to the results taken from the literature. The results were found to be in good agreement with the experimental data of Yuan et al. Second, the reactor with a chimney tray was modeled in Fluent, and steady-state simulations were performed. The uniformity due to the turbulence of the fluid was carried out using different turbulence models, and the velocity profiles along the axial direction inside the reactor were obtained. As a result, the comparison shows that the presence of a chimney tray yields lower maldistribution factor enhancement by 23% compared to the conventional structured reactor under the same operating condition. The effect of the plate orientation is also determined, and it is found that the maximum pressure drop is achieved through the rows with an orientation angle of α = 45° up to 2.3% higher than of α = 0° and α = 90°.}
