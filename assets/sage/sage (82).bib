abstract = {At the preliminary design stage for an aero-engine, the evaluation of the nozzle performance is an important aspect as it affects the overall engine cycle behaviour. Currently, there is a lack of systematic, extensive data on the nozzle performance and its dependence on the geometric and aerodynamic aspects. This paper presents a method that can be used to build characteristic maps for a nozzle as a function of a number of geometric and aerodynamic parameters. The proposed method encompasses the design of a nozzle configuration, a parameterisation of the nozzle pressure ratio, nozzle contraction ratio, plug half-angle (β), mesh generation, and an aerodynamic assessment using the Favre-averaged Navier–Stokes method. The method has been validated against experimental performance data of a plug nozzle configuration and then used for the aerodynamic assessment. The derived nozzle maps show that the thrust coefficient (Cfg) for this type of nozzle is significantly sensitive to the combined effect of the variation of the proposed parameters on the nozzle performance. These maps were used to build low-order models to predict Cfg, using response surface methods. The performance was assessed, and the results show that these low-order methods are capable of providing Cfg estimates with sufficient accuracy for use in preliminary design assessments.}

abstract = {Free convection of various nanofluids inside concentric and eccentric annular cavity with internal heat flux, fully filled with porous media is studied numerically and its heat transfer rate and pressure drop are examined. The impact of inner cylinder inclination angles (βecc = 45°, 135°, 225°, and 270°) and nanofluids (Al2O3/water, CuO/water and SiO2/water) for different heat flux (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 w/m2) on the heat transfer rate are evaluated. Initially, a validation process has been implemented to ensure that the predicted results obtained from this model are accurate. Results indicate that Al2O3 Nanofluid provides a better enhancement in the heat transfer rate when compared to SiO2 and Cu Nanofluids. Furthermore, the heat transfer coefficient increased with the inclination angle of βecc = 225°, and maximum heat transfer occurred at a heat flux of 4000 W/m2, which was roughly 6% greater than the concentric annular cylinder. The findings also indicated that while increasing the eccentricity has a minor impact on the heat transfer rate for convection-dominated flows (high heat flux), on the other hand, it has a significant impact on the heat transfer rate for conduction-dominated flows (low heat flux).}

abstract = {The aim of this article was to analyse the employability of currently enrolled secondary education (classes 9–12) students aged 14–21, specifically their functional digital skills. Digital skills are increasingly being recognised as a key foundational skill that also enhances employability. Gaining digital skills at the secondary education is important because it is one of the foundational skills that help prepare students transition to work and prepares them for life. There were three major objectives in this article: (a) to examine the trends and transitions in the acquisition of functional digital skills of currently enrolled secondary school Indian students according to their socio-economic and demographic profiles; (b) empirically investigate the factors influencing the acquisition of functional digital skills in urban areas and (c) examine whether the policy of providing schools with computers has had any discernible impact on the acquisition of functional digital skills of these students. Using the National Statistical Office 2017–2018 data on expenditure on education, we found that at the national level only 42% of the enrolled secondary school students had the ability to operate a computer and 46% had the ability to browse Internet in 2017–2018. The attainment of functional digital skills differed across rural and urban regions. The individual characteristics, socio-economic profile of households and school-related indicators were factors that explained the likelihood of students’ being equipped with functional digital skills. A key result was that students who had digital devices at home were more likely to have functional digital skills. The government had introduced computers in secondary schools in 2004 in India. We found evidence of a positive association between the provision of functional computers at secondary schools and attainment of digital skills, even for students from households with no computers at home. A key policy recommendation is that providing computers at schools can help overcome barriers to access to digital devices at home and improve the attainment of digital skills.

In previous studies, it was found that the water molecules can mediate proton transfer from nitrogen to oxygen, but the results of this study show that water molecules can also catalyse proton transfer from carbon to oxygen. With the mediation of water, the energy barriers were greatly lowered. The calculated energy barriers indicate that the para-position of phenol has higher reactivity than the ortho-position. The reaction occurs in a concerted mechanism. However, the process exhibits asynchronous characteristics, particularly the C–C bond formation precedes the proton transfer and the proton transfer from water molecules to the carbonyl oxygen is ahead of proton abstraction from the benzene ring.}

The simulations are performed using a response interactive flamelet model with detailed chemical kinetics. A detailed chemistry-based soot model is used for the prediction of soot emissions. The heights of the first and second stages of the boot shape are varied to observe the effect of the injected fuel mass distribution. In addition, results of boot shapes are compared with a trapezoidal (top-hat) shape. A detailed analysis of soot formation and oxidation is also presented for some selected rate shapes. Through computational analysis it is shown that the boot shapes have the potential to decrease combustion-generated noise and to lower emissions at the investigated load point compared to the top-hat shape. Variations in the temporal distribution of the injected fuel mass show that a lower height of the first stage and a higher height of the second stage of the boot shape result in a relatively slower rise of heat release (lower combustion-generated noise) in the early part of combustion and enhanced soot oxidation as a result of higher spray momentum near the end of injection.}

It aims at efficiently revealing nascent structural changes on a given structure with the capability to differentiate between an actual damage and a change in operational conditions. The first three damage detection levels are targeted: existence, location, and severity. The proposed algorithm is analytically developed from the dynamics theory and the virtual energy principle. Some computational techniques are proposed for carrying out computations, including discretization, integration, derivation, and suitable optimization methods. Field implementation strategies are also considered for the purpose of online damage monitoring. In order to prove the efficiency of this strategy, one experimental and three numerical case studies were conducted. The proposed algorithm successfully detected the damage in all simulated cases and estimated the damage severity with acceptable accuracy. The conclusion is that the proposed algorithm was able to efficiently detect damage appearance in a range of structures for various damage levels and locations, and under different operational conditions.}

In this work, an approach for evaluating damage processes in natural fibre composite has been developed by combining experimentally quantified damage rules with discrete representations of fabric geometry. This approach is demonstrated by predicting the tensile failure of both thermoplastic-based and thermoset-based flax fabric composites. Numerical models have been developed to estimate the damage rules from the fibre, matrix and interface properties incorporated into representative volume element (RVE) models of the composites. While both the experimentally quantified and numerically obtained sets of damage rules yield satisfactory predictions, the use of these numerical rules leads to predictions that are close to, and in some cases, better than those obtained from the quantified rules.}

abstract = {Developing a profound understanding of the combustion characteristics of the cold-start phase of a Direct Injection Spark Ignition (DISI) engine is critical to meeting increasingly stringent emissions regulations. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling of gasoline DISI combustion under normal operating conditions has been discussed in detail using both the detailed chemistry approach and flamelet models (e.g. the G-Equation). However, there has been little discussion regarding the capability of the existing models to capture DISI combustion under cold-start conditions. Accurate predictions of cold-start behavior involves the efficient use of multiple models - spray modeling to capture the split injection strategies, models to capture the wall-film interactions, ignition modeling to capture the effects of retarded spark timings, combustion modeling to accurately capture the flame front propagation, and turbulence modeling to capture the effects of decaying turbulent kinetic energy. The retarded spark timing helps to generate high heat flux in the exhaust for the faster catalyst light-off during cold-start. However, the adverse effect is a reduced turbulent flame speed due to decaying turbulent kinetic energy. Accordingly, developing an understanding of the turbulence-chemistry interactions is imperative for accurate modeling of combustion under cold-start conditions. In the present work, combustion characteristics during the cold-start, fast-idle phase is modeled using the G-Equation flamelet model and the RANS turbulence model. The challenges associated with capturing the turbulent-chemistry interactions are explained by tracking the flame front travel along the Borghi-Peters regime diagram. In this study, a modified version of the G-Equation combustion model for capturing cold-start flame travel is presented.}

abstract = {Background The aim of this study was to evaluate the rheolytic effects of stenting a mid-shaft/distal left main coronary artery (LMCA) lesion with and without ostial coverage. Stenting of the LMCA has emerged as a valid alternative in place of traditional coronary bypass graft surgery. However, in case of mid-shaft/distal lesion, there is no consensus regarding the extension of the strut coverage up to the ostium or to stent only the culprit lesion. Methods We reconstructed a left main-left descending coronary artery (LM-LCA)-left circumflex (LCX) bifurcation after analysing 100 consecutive patients (mean age 71.4 ± 9.3, 49 males) with LM mid-shaft/distal disease. The mean diameter of proximal LM, left anterior descending (LAD) and LCX, evaluated with quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) was 4.62 ± 0.86 mm, 3.31 ± 0.92 mm, and 2.74 ± 0.93 mm, respectively. For the stent simulation, a third-generation, everolimus-eluting stent was virtually reconstructed. Results After virtual stenting, the net area averaged wall shear stress (WSS) of the model and the WSS at the LCA-LCX bifurcation resulted higher when the stent covered the culprit mid-shaft lesion only compared with the extension of the stent covering the ostium (3.68 versus 2.06 Pa, p = 0.01 and 3.97 versus 1.98 Pa, p < 0.001, respectively. Similarly, the static pressure and the Reynolds number were significantly higher after stent implantation covering up the ostium. At the ostium, the flow resulted more laminar when stenting only the mid-shaft lesion than including the ostium. Conclusions Although these findings cannot be translated directly into real practice our brief study suggests that stenting lesion 1:1 or extending the stent to cover the LM ostium impacts differently the rheolytic properties of LMCA bifurcation with potential insights for restenosis or thrombosis.}
