abstract = {This article presents an experimental and computational study of the efficiency of an unshrouded transonic turbine. This research formed part of the EU Turbine Aero-Thermal External Flows II programme. The experiments were performed in the Oxford Turbine Research Facility (previously the Turbine Test Facility at QinetiQ, Farnborough). This facility is an engine scale, short duration, rotating transonic facility, in which M, Re, , and are matched to engine conditions. For these experiments, the MT1 turbine stage was installed. Historically, turbine efficiency measurements are conducted in steady state adiabatic facilities. However, short-duration facilities allow simultaneous aerodynamic and heat transfer measurements with a significant reduction in cost. An efficiency measurement system was developed for this investigation, and this is briefly described. The system allows efficiency to be evaluated to bias and precision errors of approximately ±1.45 per cent and ±0.16 per cent, respectively, to 95 per cent confidence. The results of accurate area surveys of the turbine inlet and exit flows are presented and discussed. At the turbine exit, data were taken at two traverse planes, approximately 0.5 and 4.5 rotor axial chords downstream of the rotor. The turbine efficiency was experimentally evaluated based on the data at both planes, using a number of mixing models, which are discussed and compared. The experimental result of turbine efficiency is also compared to that estimated from a mean-line prediction. Full-stage steady and unsteady computational fluid dynamics of the experiment using the Rolls-Royce HYDRA code was conducted and is also presented. The predicted and measured rotor exit flow-fields are compared at both downstream traverse planes.}

abstract = {The problem of publication bias has long been discussed in research fields such as medicine. There is a consensus that publication bias is a reality and that solutions should be found to reduce it. In methodological computational research, including cancer informatics, publication bias may also be at work. The publication of negative research findings is certainly also a relevant issue, but has attracted very little attention to date. The present paper aims at providing a new formal framework to describe the notion of publication bias in the context of methodological computational research, facilitate and stimulate discussions on this topic, and increase awareness in the scientific community. We report an exemplary pilot study that aims at gaining experiences with the collection and analysis of information on unpublished research efforts with respect to publication bias, and we outline the encountered problems. Based on these experiences, we try to formalize the notion of publication bias.}

This research seeks to expand our understanding of sociological explanation through a computational approach. Explanations commonly encountered in introductory sociology texts are used to develop a typology of explanatory forms. A computational strategy that represents sociological knowledge using a combination of frames, semantic networks, and procedural rules is described. It is then demonstrated that this approach can generate the full range of these explanations for all logical combinations of conditions and for the full scope of sociological knowledge. This approach is also shown to be capable of identifying appropriate explanations, assessing the quality of explanations, and generating new insights.}

abstract = {Abstract The paper presents the overall frame, principal steps, and some results of a numerical model of a power boiler furnace that uses pulverized coal, with tangential disposition of the burners. This model demonstrates the application potential of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique and of the computational thermal analysis. Complex three-dimensional furnace geometry, two-phase turbulent flow, coal combustion, and heat transfer have been examined. Two numerical modelling approaches were employed in the investigation, both based on the Euler-Lagrangean two-phase flow concept and on the gas-phase semiempirical k-ɛ turbulence model. The first approach is based on a specially developed comprehensive model of processes in a pulverized coal furnace. In the second case, a commercial CFD code is used to create a three-dimensional furnace model. Some distinctive results concerning the performance of the boiler that was examined are presented graphically. On the basis of a comparison between the simulation predictions and available site measurements, a conclusion can be drawn that these two numerical codes provide realistic insight into furnace processes. Qualitative agreement indicates that the calculations are reasonable and validates the submodels employed.}

abstract = {Extracorporeal endotoxin removal by means of the Toraymyxin device is based on the ability of polymyxin B to bind endotoxins with a high specificity. The endotoxins/polymyxin molecular interactions were computationally analyzed in a parallel work (Part I). In this paper we investigate with a multi-scale approach the phenomena involving blood and plasma fluid dynamics inside the device. The macro- and mesoscale phenomena were studied by means of 3D models using computational fluid dynamics. The flow behavior in the sorbent material was focused, modeling the sorbent as a homogeneous porous medium at the macroscale level, or accounting for the realistic geometry of its knitted fibers at the mesoscale level. A microscale model was then developed to analyze the behavior of endotoxin molecules subjected to the competition of flow drag and molecular attraction by fibergrafted polymyxin B. The macroscale results showed that a very regular flow field develops in the sorbent, furthermore supplying the peak velocity to be input in the lower-scale model. The mesoscale analysis yielded the realistic range for wall shear stresses (WSSs) acting on fiber walls. With WSS values in the entire range, the results of the microscale analysis demonstrated that the capability of polymyxin B to capture endotoxin molecules from the flow extends at distances one order of magnitude greater than the characteristic distance of the stable intermolecular bond. We conclude that the use of an integrated, multi-scale analysis allows for a comprehensive understanding of the complex mechanisms involved in endotoxin sorption phenomena with immobilized polymyxin B.}

It is shown that the strong nonlinearity in the temperature-dependent thermal properties of NiTi in conjunction with the very different thermal properties of Al can result into a thermal diode of high thermal rectification ratio. As a first level of study, Ni50Ti50 is considered and the effects of various NiTi-Al geometrical configurations, initial temperature, and temperature difference at two ends on the thermal rectification ratio are studied numerically. Within the adopted temperature range (300–400 K, where phase transformation in NiTi occurs), it is shown that NiTi-Al thermal diodes are feasible with rectification ratio up to 4.8, which is quite higher than the ratios in currently known solid-state thermal diodes. This fundamental computational study could provide an important basis and motivation for the development of the next generation of high-temperature solid-state thermal diodes based on smart material such as NiTi shape memory alloys or others.}

abstract = {Purpose: To use computational simulations to compare the hemodynamic characteristics of a classic bifurcated stent-graft to an equally long endograft design with “dog bone”–shaped limbs (DB), which have large diameter proximal and distal ends and significant narrowing at the midsection to accommodate aneurysms with an extremely narrow bifurcation. Materials and Methods: A 3-dimensional model was constructed using commercially available validated software. Inlet and outlet diameters were 28 and 14 mm, respectively. The total length of both models was kept constant to 180 mm, but the main body of the DB model was 20 mm shorter than the bifurcated endograft. The iliac limbs of the DB model had a 9-mm stenosis over a 30-mm segmental length in the midsection. Flow was quantified by time-averaged wall shear stress, oscillatory shear index (OSI), and relative residence time (RRT). The displacement forces in newtons (N) and maximum wall shear stress (WSS) in pascals (Pa) were compared during a cardiac cycle at 3 segments (main body, bifurcation, and iliac limbs) of both models with computational fluid dynamics analysis. Results: The DB accommodation was associated with higher forces at the main body (range 3.15–4.9 Ν) compared with the classic configuration (1.56–2.34 N). On the contrary, the forces at the bifurcation (3.81–5.98 vs 3.76–5.54 N) and at the iliac limbs (0.34–0.85 vs 0.49–0.74 N) were comparable for both models. Accordingly, maximum WSS was detected at the iliac sites for both models throughout the cardiac cycle. The highest values were detected at peak systole and equaled 26.6 and 12 Pa for the DB and bifurcated configurations, respectively. The narrow segments in the DB model displayed high stress values but low OSI and very low RRT. Conclusion: The DB accommodation seems to correlate with higher displacement forces at the main body and higher stresses at the iliac limbs. Consequently, regular imaging follow-up of the DB design deems necessary to delineate its mid- and long-term clinical performance.}

However, the reasons why volitional control might result in superior acquisition and the limits to such advantages remain poorly understood. In this article, we review the issue from both a cognitive and computational perspective. On the cognitive side, self-directed learning allows individuals to focus effort on useful information they do not yet possess, can expose information that is inaccessible via passive observation, and may enhance the encoding and retention of materials. On the computational side, the development of efficient “active learning” algorithms that can select their own training data is an emerging research topic in machine learning. This review argues that recent advances in these related fields may offer a fresh theoretical perspective on how people gather information to support their own learning.}

abstract = {Saint Louis encephalitis virus, a member of the flaviviridae subgroup, is a culex mosquito-borne pathogen. Despite severe epidemic outbreaks on several occasions, not much progress has been made with regard to an epitope-based vaccine designed for Saint Louis encephalitis virus. The envelope proteins were collected from a protein database and analyzed with an in silico tool to identify the most immunogenic protein. The protein was then verified through several parameters to predict the T-cell and B-cell epitopes. Both T-cell and B-cell immunity were assessed to determine that the protein can induce humoral as well as cell-mediated immunity. The peptide sequence from 330–336 amino acids and the sequence REYCYEATL from the position 57 were found as the most potential B-cell and T-cell epitopes, respectively. Furthermore, as an RNA virus, one important thing was to establish the epitope as a conserved one; this was also done by in silico tools, showing 63.51% conservancy. The epitope was further tested for binding against the HLA molecule by computational docking techniques to verify the binding cleft epitope interaction. However, this is a preliminary study of designing an epitope-based peptide vaccine against Saint Louis encephalitis virus; the results awaits validation by in vitro and in vivo experiments.}

A typical technique for encouraging higher-order thinking is to use instructional design interventions that engage learners in simple cognitive activities. Business simulation game (BSG) is one of the types of interactive learning environments that can increase HOTS. In addition, student engagement and attitude toward technology use are considered strong influences on HOTS. The study explored the effect of using a BSG on HOTS and student engagement. It examined the influence of attitude toward the use of a BSG on HOTS and student engagement. The results of the t-test analysis showed that learning activities using BSG had a positive effect on HOTS and student engagement. Additionally, PLS-SEM analysis results indicated that immersion, interaction, and intention to use the game influence student engagement. Furthermore, student engagement significantly influenced HOTS. The findings indicate that students must demonstrate that they are engaging actively in a course to improve HOTS and that a BSG can be a valuable and effective tool for promoting engagement. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic caused limitations in sampling and representativeness of respondents. Future research should involve a bigger sample size and students who have attended related courses.}

One assumes that there are layers near the mould surfaces with much less viscosity and the other only use one viscosity model. The numerical experiments showed that the pressure could be accurately predicted with both approaches. The property necessary to predict correct pressure with altered mould closing velocities was that the bulk material had to obey shear-thinning effects. Preheating effects before compression were neglected, but altering the heating time until the prepreg was assumed to start flow had a significant effect. The experiments confirmed that the pressure is predominantly affected by the mould closing velocity. Regardless of the considered process settings, a first pressure top always appeared approximately at the logarithmic strain 0.25. A second top was associated with a slowdown of the press. The location of this was affected by the velocity and the vacuum, the latter indicating that vacuum assistance prevents a build-up of back pressure. Furthermore, heated prepreg above a critical temperature is observed to swell immediately as vacuum assistance is applied.}

abstract = {It is widely recognised among educational theorists, educators and policy makers alike, that critical thinking should claim a superordinate place in our system of educational objectives. In the philosophical literature on this topic, critical thinking is often conceptualised as the educational cognate of rationality, which in turn is analysed as being comprised of the relevant skills and abilities to assess reasons and evidence, together with the intellectual dispositions to actively use these proficiencies in practice. The resulting picture is in many respects normative and idealised, following the style of philosophical theorising commonplace in the tradition of analytic philosophy of education. In contrast, certain recent empirical findings related to the rational performance of actual human beings seem to cast doubts on the extent to which we can expect people to fulfil these idealised normative standards of rationality. After introducing the relevant philosophical theories and psychological results, I ruminate on the implications these ideas have on our pedagogical views pertaining to critical thinking education.}

In determining edges it is not possible to delimit arbitrarily the region on which each point computes. So in this context a global computation is defined. This leads to a novel way of investigating clustering. When the edges of a figure have been sequenced to yield the boundary it is then possible to determine its shape. The study of shape has been confined to convex figures. In these an attempt is made to extract global units which correspond to corner-like regions. Finally, it is suggested that a theory which evolves in the manner described has a more unitary aspect than other approaches.}

abstract = {Background and purpose: Computational fluid dynamics method (CFDM) and optical flow method (OFM) effectively provide the hemodynamic information based on the digital subtraction angiogram (DSA). However, the quantitative analysis in comparison of CFDM and OFM is still absent. The goal of this study is to apply CFDM and OFM in quantitative analysis of stenting treatment. Material and method: A left carotid stenosis patient underwent stenting of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was analyzed as an example. CFDM and OFM for hemodynamic analysis on digital subtraction angiography before and after stenting treatment were presented. Results: Improvement gains of blood flow velocities on left internal carotid artery after stenting treament for different initial conditions on the common carotid artery were 1.91 ∼ 2.13, 1.62 ∼ 2.09, and 0.69 by CFDM with Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids and OFM, respectively. With the CFDM analysis, the flow mapping by OFM using time resolved DSA data on the fly to estimate hemodynamic significance of a cervical carotid stenosis was explained. Conclusion: Quantificative blood flow estimations by CFDM and OFM to evaluate the treatment outcomes to patient with carotid stenosis are practical. Both methods are able to provide quantitative information of blood flow for stenting treatment. It is advantagious to use both methods in treatment evaluation.}

abstract = {In wind turbines, blades are critical design members because performance depends on blade material, shape, twist angle, etc. The problem of internal, mechanical design and material selection for a prototypical high-power horizontal axis wind turbine blade under static, flap-wise loading is investigated in this study. At first a materials selection methodology has been proposed. A very detailed computational analysis based on finite element modes is developed representing the load-carrying box girder of the blade with a given airfoil shape, size, and the type and position of the interior load-bearing longitudinal beams–shear webs. Results concerning displacements and stresses are generated using both plane and shell elements with linear and nonlinear analyses.}

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the most important superfamily of protein targets in current ligand discovery and drug development. GPCRs are integral membrane proteins that play key roles in various cellular signaling processes. Therefore, GPCR signaling pathways are closely associated with numerous diseases, including cancer and several neurological, immunological, and hematological disorders. Computer-aided drug design (CADD) can expedite the process of GPCR drug discovery and potentially reduce the actual cost of research and development. Increasing knowledge of biological structures, as well as improvements on computer power and algorithms, have led to unprecedented use of CADD for the discovery of novel GPCR modulators. Similarly, machine learning approaches are now widely applied in various fields of drug target research. This review briefly summarizes the application of rising CADD methodologies, as well as novel machine learning techniques, in GPCR structural studies and bioligand discovery in the past few years. Recent novel computational strategies and feasible workflows are updated, and representative cases addressing challenging issues on olfactory receptors, biased agonism, and drug-induced cardiotoxic effects are highlighted to provide insights into future GPCR drug discovery.}
