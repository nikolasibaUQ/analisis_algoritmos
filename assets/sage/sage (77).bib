abstract = {The well-known glove box arrangement used in the nuclear industry maintains a pressure depression within a contaminated volume while allowing passage of a small purge flow to the filtration plant. Conventionally, if a glove tears for example, an electromechanical control system restores the depression by opening and regulating an extra connection to the filtration duct. However, faster response and lower maintenance overheads result from replacing the conventional system with the fluidic vortex amplifier (VA) but coupled ventilation system and VA dynamics can be unstable. Designers needed a tool to predict oscillatory performance and, ideally, to advise on the strengths of influence of network parameters on stability. A system modelling approach is presented in which pipework dynamics, including steady state friction, are presented by transmission line modelling (TLM). A semi-empirical feedback model of linearized VA dynamics has been developed and shown to be substantially correct. The model’s restriction to small signals does not adversely affect investigation of perturbation growth or decay. Partial transmission line representation of the VA model with special measures for feedback allowed time-domain simulations of network perturbations. However, this approach is indirect and it was possible to convert the whole VA model to transmission lines and then reformulate the TLM scheme into a direct, quantitative stability analysis. Extension of the technique provided a means of assessing the sensitivity of the stability to simple network alterations. The method has been programmed on an 80386 PC and successfully used on a large ventilation system. Success in the present context of dynamic stability for fluidic nuclear ventilation networks should be repeatable in other areas since the approach is applicable to any TLM-amenable system, be it fluid, mechanical, electrical or mixed.}

abstract = {In our systematic mapping study, we examined 289 published works to determine which intelligent computing methods (e.g. Artificial Neural Networks, Machine Learning, and Fuzzy Logic) used by air-conditioning systems can provide energy savings and improve thermal comfort. Our goal was to identify which methods have been used most in research on the topic, which methods of data collection have been employed, and which areas of research have been empirical in nature. We observed the rules for literature reviews in identifying published works on databases (e.g. the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers database, the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, SpringerLink, ScienceDirect, and Wiley Online Library) and classified identified works by topic. After excluding works according to the predefined criteria, we reviewed selected works according to the research parameters motivating our study. Results reveal that energy savings is the most frequently examined topic and that intelligent computing methods can be used to provide better indoor environments for occupants, with energy savings of up to 50%. The most common intelligent method used has been artificial neural networks, while sensors have been the tools most used to collect data, followed by searches of databases of experiments, simulations, and surveys accessed to validate the accuracy of findings.}

abstract = {It has been noted by many researchers that young bilingual children pass through a stage of early mixing which extends approximately until the age of 2;6 and ends abruptly. Research on bilingual first language acquisition has clearly excluded the possibility to explain mixed utterances as the result of a fused lexical or grammatical system. However, the actual debate on the reasons for early mixing still continues. Two main approaches have dominated the field of language mixing in adults: One assumes that adult’s codeswitching is constrained by grammatical principles, suggesting that a third grammar is responsible for the grammaticality of mixed utterances (e.g., the Equivalence Constraint formulated by Poplack (1980), or the Functional Head Constraint formulated by Belazi, Rubin & Toribio (1994) among others). Since child grammar is supposed to be organized differently from adult grammar, the grammatical “ingredients” of the principles which constrain codeswitching are absent in early child language (Köppe & Meisel, 1995). It therefore follows that early mixing in young bilingual children is not to be considered as constrained by any grammatical principles. The other approach argues that codeswitching in adults is not regulated by external grammatical principles, but that the only constraints which govern codeswitching are those required by the two languages involved (MacSwan, 2000). We will show that this assumption holds for child language as well. Our analysis of mixing opens the perspective that child grammar can be considered to be organized in the same way as adult grammar. Furthermore, we will argue that early mixing is related to developing performance abilities, in the present paper to the readiness on the bilingual child’s part to speak the language(s).}

abstract = {The objective of the paper is to investigate the internal flow characteristics inside the inducer under the gas-water condition using a combination of experiment and numerical simulations. Gas-water mixing is achieved by an annular gas mixing device and visualized by high-speed imaging technology. Meanwhile, the shear stress transport (SST) k-ω model coupled with the VOF model is applied to investigate the gas phase distribution. Numerically simulated inducer energy characteristics and internal gas-phase distribution are in good agreement with experimental data. The results show that the mixed gas-liquid flow inside the inducer exhibits three flow patterns: wavy flow, bubbly flow, and plug flow. For the wavy flow, a series of wavy structures on the blade surface and gas-pocket bubbles near the blade rim are observed. From wavy flow to bubbly flow, uniform bubble streams on the blade surface and spiraling strip bubbles near the edge of the blade are observed. For plug flow, bubble accumulation results in a bullet-shaped plug, and the strip-shaped bubbles near the blade rim are more obvious. In the same axial position of the inducer, the proportion of gas phase is increasing as the flow coefficient increases, thus affecting the inducer performance. The main frequency amplitude of the pressure pulsations gradually rise when the flow pattern changes from wavy to plug flow.}

abstract = {In this article we consider the problem of task-directed information gathering. We first develop a decision-theo retic model of task-directed sensing in which sensors are modeled as noise-contaminated, uncertain measurement systems, and sensing tasks are inodeled by a transforma tion describing the type of information required by the task, a utility function describing sensitivity to error, and a cost function describing time or resource constraints on the system. This description allows us to develop a standard condi tional Bayes decision-making model where the value of information, or payoff, of an estimate is defined as the average utility (the expected value of some function of decision or estimation error) relative to the current proba bility distribution and the best estimate is that which max imizes payoff. The optimal sensor viewing strategy is that which maximizes the net payoff (decision value minus observation costs) of the final estimate. The advantage of this solution is generality—it does not assume a particular sensing modality or sensing task. However, solutions to this updating problem do not exist in closed form. This motivates the development of an approximation to the optimal solution based on a grid-based implementation of Bayes’ theorem. We describe this algorithm, analyze its error properties. and indicate how it can be made robust to errors in the description of sensors and discrepancies between geomet ric models and sensed objects. We also present the results of this fusion technique applied to several different infor mation gathering tasks in simulated situations and in a distributed sensing system we have constructed.}

abstract = {Psychological experiments on children’s development of spatial knowledge suggest that experience at self-locomotion and visual tracking are important factors. Yet, the mechanism underlying development is unknown. We propose a robot that learns to track a target object mentally (i.e., maintaining a representation of an object’s position when outside the field of view) as a model for spatial development. Mental tracking is considered as prediction of an object’s position, given the previous environmental state and motor commands and the current environment state resulting from movement. Following Jordan and Rumelhart’s (1992) forward modeling architecture, the system consists of two components: an inverse model of sensory input to desired motor commands and a forward model of motor commands to desired sensory input (goals). The robot was tested on the “three cups”paradigm (in which children are required, under various movement conditions, to select the cup containing the hidden object). Consistent with child development, in the absence of the capacity for self-locomotion, the robot makes errors that are self-center-based. When given the ability for self-locomotion, the robot responds allocentrically.}

abstract = {Concrete in transportation infrastructure is constantly subjected to the ingress of chloride, which could cause reinforcement corrosion and significant deterioration of concrete structures if not well controlled. Major types of reinforcement corrosion, such as pitting corrosion and concentration-cell corrosion, are usually initiated with localized chloride concentrations whose behavior is closely related to the transport characteristics of chloride ions in hydrated cement paste. However, unless studied at the molecular level, chloride transport behavior cannot be properly understood and controlled in view of the high heterogeneity of cement paste. The findings are presented from a research study recently conducted with a molecular dynamics (MD) approach to investigate the physicochemical nature of the various interactions between chloride ions and cement hydration products, which might significantly influence chloride transport in cement paste. Six hydrated compounds including portlandite, C-S-H phases (tobermorite and jennite), AFm phases (hydrocalumite and kuzelite), and the AFt phase (ettringite) were modeled and then validated by using the 35Cl nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy technique. On the basis of the MD-generated ionic trajectory, the macroscopic transport phenomenon of chloride species was evaluated in the vicinity of each different hydration product in terms of a computed effective diffusion coefficient.}

abstract = {In elasticity, microstructure-related deviations may be modeled by strain gradient elasticity. For so-called metamaterials, different implementations are possible for solving strain gradient elasticity problems numerically. Analytical solutions of simple problems are used to verify the numerical approach. We demonstrate such a case in a two-dimensional continuum as a benchmark case for computations. As strain gradient enforces higher regularity conditions in displacements, in the finite element method (FEM), the use of standard elements is often seen as inadequate. For such piecewise or elementwise continuous elements, we examine a possible remedy to correctly simulate strain gradient elasticity problems by implementing two techniques. First, we enforce continuity of displacement gradient across elements; second, we employ a mixed finite element method where displacement and its gradient are solved both as unknowns. The results show the pros and cons of each numerical technique. All methods converge monotonically, but the mixed method is more reliable than the other one.}

Previous empirical research has reported contrasting conclusions about the effect of pair programming on student learning. To further understand students’ pair programming, this study uses a mixed method to analyze three contrasting pairs’ collaborative behaviors, discourses, and perceptions from a multi-dimensional perspective. The analysis results show that the high-ranked student pair is characterized as the interactive, socially-supportive, and goal-oriented pair; the middle-ranked student pair is characterized as the highly-interactive, socially-supportive, and process-oriented pair; and the low-ranked student pair is characterized as the lowly-interactive, socially-unsupportive, and programming-distracted pair. The research reveals complex relations between collaborative behaviors, discourses, and performances, which have critical influences on students’ pair programming quality. Based on the results, this research proposes pedagogical, analytical, and theoretical implications for future instructional design, learning analytics, and empirical research of collaborative programming.}

Critical strain energy release rates are measured by performing double can- tilever beam test on composites stitched with Vectran as stitch fiber, and are found to increase with increasing stitch thread thickness and stitch density. It is also revealed that the relationship between GIC and stitch density or stitch thread volume fraction appears to be linear. Interlaminar tension test is conducted to identify important fracture behavior of a single Vectran stitch fiber thread. The finite-element (FE) model of the stitched composite incorporates the novel four-step stitch fracture pro- cess, namely, interfacial debonding, slack absorption, fiber breakage, and pullout friction. The FE predictions of load-displacement curves and critical mode I strain energy release rates show good agreement with the experimental results. The differ- ences in interdependent stitch mechanisms between moderately stitched and densely stitched composites are discussed.}

This problem is modeled as a dynamic traveling repairman problem with time windows, and with three objectives considered: maximization of the number of serviced customers, minimization of customer waiting, and minimization of total travel time. A solution (simulation) framework, extending techniques developed for single-objective dynamic routing problems in the literature, is proposed to tackle this multiobjective problem. An efficient chained local search heuristic is embedded in this solution framework to solve the underlying static problem, the traveling salesman problem with time windows. Comprehensive simulation experiments conducted on data sets derived from benchmark problems show that the proposed algorithmic approach is able to provide high-quality solutions with limited computing effort. These experiments also indicate that the multiobjective model proposed in this study can offer much more attractive solutions to decision makers than single-objective models.}

Noise amplification is kept under control by adjusting the regularization parameter (guided by generalized cross-validation) in the algebraic equations. The performance of this procedure is demonstrated by applying it to different types of spectral data taken from the literature.}

abstract = {The purpose of this research is to examine one of the most effective approaches for locating niche tourism attractions that varies by people, using a methodology that combines statistical analysis, deep learning visual image detection, and text mining. Using 30,013 posts with the hashtag #Seoul in English, the analysis focused on the Instagram posts’ time, dominant color, image visual content, and hashtag to identify niche tourism attractions. The analysis result shows that Instagram posts hashtag #Seoul that depicted “young women” and was uploaded in the evening with warm colors such as orange, yellow, and green received more “likes” than other postings. Furthermore, deep learning and text mining analysis were used to identify and forecast the actual image with the most likes in each sectoral domain, as classified by topic modeling, such as “young, woman, outdoor” and “table, plate, indoor.” Through these findings, this study identified niche hotspots of tourism attractions based on those destination image attributes in Instagram photos, which contributes to the popularity of Instagram postings. The methods and results will be particularly useful to marketers and researchers looking to uncover specialized tourism themes and combine popularity measurement with visual image analysis.}
