abstract = {The geometric effects of Coanda trailing edges on the aerodynamic performance of an airfoil are numerically evaluated for a range of different freestream Mach numbers and momentum coefficients. A Circulation control (CC) airfoil with a circular trailing edge (ACTE) proves to have better control effectiveness at low subsonic freestream speeds (Mach = 0.1). A CC airfoil having an elliptic trailing edge (AETE) outperforms the ACTE at high subsonic flow conditions. The occurrence of Cμ-stall for the AETE is greatly postponed, and meanwhile the maximum net lift coefficient increment achieved for the AETE (ΔCL = 0.51) is slightly higher than that of the ACTE (ΔCL = 0.50) at Mach 0.6. Compared to the ACTE, the AETE is found to have better control consistency at different operating velocities and better control stability when the Coanda jet is supersonic. Through careful consideration of the aerodynamic performance and the control effects, the most appropriate axial ratio for an AETE ellipse is within the interval from 1.5 to 2. Finally, the flow field instability phenomenon and the jet detachment induced by the supersonic Coanda jet are investigated. A self-sustained shock-wave instability phenomenon without jet detachment is first observed in this paper.}

abstract = {Representing causal social science knowledge in models is difficult: much of the best knowledge is qualitative and ambiguously conditional, unlike the knowledge in “physics models.” This paper describes a stream of RAND research that began with qualitative models providing a structured depiction of casual factors creating effects. That has subsequently been extended to an unusual kind of uncertainty sensitive computational modeling that enables exploratory reasoning and analysis. We illustrate the approach with applications to counterterrorism, detection of terrorists, and nuclear crises. We believe that the approach will complement other approaches that can reflect social science phenomena [see other papers in this special issue of JDMS] and that the approach has broad potential within and beyond the national security domain. We also believe that it has the potential to inform empirical work—encouraging a transition from the step-by-step empirical testing of simple discrete hypotheses to the testing and refinement of more comprehensive causal models.}

abstract = {Conventional single card air yarn units create flow vortices in the carding box that affect the fiber structure and thus the yarn performance. Key parameters for airflow characteristics include geometry and spinning parameters (Such as the length of the nozzle, the width of the inlet and outlet, the speed and diameter of the felting roller). This paper proposes to improve the transport channel to reduce eddy currents in the upflow region and to analyze airflow fields using fluid knowledge. This paper examines three designs: a bypass circular channel entrance for air supply, rounded corners at the bottom right in the conveyor channel and combining both modifications. According to the analysis, a nozzle inlet/outlet ratio between 0.5 and 1 gives the lowest swirl and the highest mass flow. Considering the yarn characteristics and the system production efficiency, it is ideal when the barbed roll speed is 8000 rpm and the diameter is about 30 mm. It is possible to dissipate the vortices for three methods.}

abstract = {Modeling an intelligent adversary has provided great challenges to simulated training realism. Traditional approaches to modeling have relied on rule-based and analytical decision-making models in an attempt to optimize the decision making of an intelligent computer-generated adversary. In order to promote realistic transfer of training in the realm of command and control, the trainee must experience realistic decision-making behavior in the enemy. This means that the enemy must make realistic decisions based on environmental constraints, goals, and intent. The enemy’s decisions must then be reflected by the simulated agents. The Recognition-Primed Decision (RPD) Model is a descriptive model of expert decision making in real-world settings. We have several related projects where the goal is to translate the conceptual RPD Model into a computer model that can simulate realistic expert decision making. In attempting this feat, we have discovered many valuable lessons about modeling cognition and decision making, and about the assumptions and mechanisms underlying the RPD Model. The purpose of this paper is to report those findings.}

It differs from most earlier work in the field of computer-assisted graphing in three major ways: first, we focus broadly on a wide variety of types of graphs, used in several different subject matter contexts; second, we conduct research into problem solving processes in an unmodified whole-classroom environment; third, we supplement participant observations on student cognition with extensive behavioral sequence data gathered automatically and unobtrusively by the computer. We detail our attempts to develop, adapt, and apply quantitative methods of analysis of behavioral sequences which are potentially applicable to such data gathered for a large number of students.}

The characteristics of the formed density profiles were defined and their correlations to the process parameters and Brinell hardness and elastic recovery were analysed. Compression ratio and closing time had the strongest effect on the formation of the density profile, as well as the hardness and elastic recovery. The amount of localised deformation (peak area) did not have significant effect on the Brinell hardness or elastic recovery, whereas, the highest density achieved (peak density) and its location (peak distance) dominated the effect. Brinell hardness and elastic recovery were found to correlate well with each other.}

abstract = {The Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT) is the most widely used norm-referenced creativity test used in gifted identification. Although commonly used for identifying talent, little is known about how creativity tests, like the TTCT-Figural, contribute to the probability of being identified as gifted especially with underrepresented populations. Using nominated students (n = 1,191) from a diverse midsized urban school district, this study examined the differential predictive validity among student demographics (i.e., race/ethnicity, free/reduced price lunch status, English learning status, sex) and the TTCT-Figural to the probability of being identified as gifted. Results of a multilevel hierarchical generalized linear regression indicated underrepresented groups showed no difference in the probability of being identified after controlling for cognitive ability and academic achievement; the same was true when the TTCT-Figural was included within the model. The inclusion of the TTCT-Figural does contribute to the probability of identification; however, the disproportionality of underrepresented student groups remains in this school district. Gifted administrators looking to enhance equity may not find the solution with the mere inclusion of a creativity assessment. Implications for practice and future directions are discussed.}

These values are characterized and put to a common scale, allowing measurement of their contribution to the overall objective. The resulting hierarchy can be used to guide software development or compare different interface solutions. In this study, a VFT hierarchy was developed with military intelligence analysts to identify what values were desired in an interface for software intended to address a facet of data overload. The prototype interface was evaluated against the hierarchy with these stated values. The process and the hierarchy itself provided insight on where resources should be expended to provide the greatest benefit in the final product.}

abstract = {Trustworthy-looking faces are also perceived as more attractive, but are there other meaningful cues that contribute to perceived trustworthiness? Using data-driven models, we identify these cues after removing attractiveness cues. In Experiment 1, we show that both judgments of trustworthiness and attractiveness of faces manipulated by a model of perceived trustworthiness change in the same direction. To control for the effect of attractiveness, we build two new models of perceived trustworthiness: a subtraction model, which forces the perceived attractiveness and trustworthiness to be negatively correlated (Experiment 2), and an orthogonal model, which reduces their correlation (Experiment 3). In both experiments, faces manipulated to appear more trustworthy were indeed perceived to be more trustworthy, but not more attractive. Importantly, in both experiments, these faces were also perceived as more approachable and with more positive expressions, as indicated by both judgments and machine learning algorithms. The current studies show that the visual cues used for trustworthiness and attractiveness judgments can be separated, and that apparent approachability and facial emotion are driving trustworthiness judgments and possibly general valence evaluation.}

Regarding decision-making and forecasting systems in particular, AI and machine learning (ML) technologies have provided an opportunity to improve the mutual relationships between machines and humans. When the connection between ML and architecture is considered, it is possible to claim that there is no parallel acceleration as in other disciplines. In this study, and considering the latest breakthroughs, we focus on revealing what ML and architecture have in common. Our focal point is to reveal common points by classifying and analyzing current literature through describing the potential of ML in architecture. Studies conducted using ML techniques and subsets of AI technologies were used in this paper, and the resulting data were interpreted using the bibliometric analysis method. In order to discuss the state-of-the-art research articles which have been published between 2014 and 2020, main subjects, subsets, and keywords were refined through the search engines. The statistical figures were demonstrated as huge datasets, and the results were clearly delineated through Sankey diagrams. Thanks to bibliometric analyses of the current literature of WOS (Web of Science), CUMINCAD (Cumulative Index about publications in Computer Aided Architectural Design supported by the sibling associations ACADIA, CAADRIA, eCAADe, SIGraDi, ASCAAD, and CAAD futures), predictable data have been presented allowing recommendations for possible future studies for researchers.}

abstract = {Processing rewarding and aversive signals lies at the core of many adaptive behaviors, including value-based decision making. The brain circuits processing these signals are widespread and include the prefrontal cortex, amygdala and striatum, and their dopaminergic innervation. In this review, we integrate historic findings on the behavioral and neural mechanisms of value-based decision making with recent, groundbreaking work in this area. On the basis of this integrated view, we discuss a neuroeconomic framework of value-based decision making, use this to explain the motivation to pursue rewards and how motivation relates to the costs and benefits associated with different courses of action. As such, we consider substance addiction and overeating as states of altered value-based decision making, in which the expectation of reward chronically outweighs the costs associated with substance use and food consumption, respectively. Together, this review aims to provide a concise and accessible overview of important literature on the neural mechanisms of behavioral adaptation to reward and aversion and how these mediate motivated behaviors.}

In this article, we suggest a strengths-based, system-level, and theory-driven approach to encourage the field to shift away from the practice of “fixing” children when providing STEM learning and teaching for young children with disabilities. At the conclusion of this article, we also offer critical questions for readers to ponder and reflect on their work.}
