abstract = {Media convergence is not a new concept in journalism studies, though available evidence indicates that convergence studies have been explored more in the global north than the global south. This study, contextualised in Nigeria, joins the media convergence conversation by exploring the sustainability of Facebook-radio convergence for distributing broadcast programmes by seventeen (17) licenced radio stations in Oyo State, Nigeria. As a computational content analysis study, researchers analysed 85 purposively selected programmes of the stations as broadcast live on their Facebook pages alongside the 9527 likes, 10,314 shares, 7007 comments and 170,681 views the programmes generated. Stakeholders’ interviews were also conducted for a broadcasting expert, presenters of some of the stations, together with audience of the selected stations. The main finding shows that programmes that focussed more on socioeconomic problems and opportunities, and were broadcast in the afternoon, evening and at night received more digital engagement than other programmes’ formats and time belts. Although high cost of Internet data subscription in the country, absence of Internet-enabled mobile phones among many adherents of radio programmes (both in rural and urban areas), epileptic power supply that sometimes leave many people with unpowered mobile phones as well as weak Internet broadband connectivity common to many locations in Nigeria threaten the sustainability of Facebook-radio broadcasting in Oyo State. Deployment of 5G network, installation of more network masts with strong bandwidth and training of radio presenters and radio stations’ social media handlers on innovative and audience-participatory programme production are recommended.}

Two different methods for capturing the free interface movement are applied, namely the volume-of-fluid method and the level-set method. Both methods are very popular and available within commercial computational fluid dynamics tools. The wave is initialized using two different perturbations implemented into the model. As a case study, a system comprising a toluene layer and an aqueous layer is chosen. Numerical results obtained by both methods are in a good agreement with the linear stability theory for small wave amplitudes. The application of both methods is compared and their advantages and drawbacks are highlighted.}

abstract = {A novel adaptive fuzzy control approach with low computational costs is addressed for the longitudinal non-affine model of a generic hypersonic vehicle subject to parametric uncertainties, capable of guaranteeing that altitude and velocity tracking errors exhibit prescribed performance. A new performance function is devised to impose preselected bounds on the transient and steady-state tracking error performance, and then a transformed error is constructed, which converts the original “constrained” system into an equivalent “unconstrained” one for the simplicity of control designs. Furthermore, a simplified fuzzy controller is exploited for the altitude subsystem, eliminating the issue of “explosion of complexity” that is associated with back-stepping control. For the velocity subsystem, a prescribed performance-based proportional–integral controller is utilized. The special contributions of the proposed control strategy are that it can guarantee altitude and velocity tracking errors with desired transient and steady-state performance, and meanwhile the computational load is quite low. Finally, numerical simulation results are presented to verify the efficiency of the design.}

abstract = {Abstract A number of modelling approaches, such as enterprise modelling, simulation modelling, and causal loop diagramming, have been used independently for designing systems of different kinds, such as machine systems, social systems, and production systems. Enterprise modelling has its roots in control system design. Simulation modelling has generally been used in re-engineering and optimizing production and service processes, whereas causal loop diagramming (systems thinking) has generally been used for systems designing in management and social sciences. This paper describes the combined use of these three modelling approaches which carry complementary concepts that can be used together for supporting management decisions in designing and changing complex manufacturing enterprises. A decision support framework is presented that is instrumented with combined use of these three modelling approaches and has been tested in production management-related decision making.}

abstract = {The major objective of this study is to develop a computational fatigue test method for welded structures. The damage mechanics approach is used to derive explicit expressions for fatigue life estimation within the framework of continuum mechanics. Microdamage model is applied to calculate the quasi-brittle material damage prior to the crack initiation. Based on the two-scale model, that is, micro versus meso (macro) scale linkage scheme is implemented in conjunction with finite element method to describe the crack initiation or propagation. For the material damage model used at microscale, a finite element code is developed. Lemaitre’s unified damage model and constitutive equation were chosen so as to ensure the efficiency for developing finite element algorithm. Identification method for material parameters required to constitutive equation is proposed using inversion of Ramberg-Osgood type constitutive model. In order to consider weld-induced residual stresses, the Ueda’s inherent strain scheme is incorporated into the calculation of residual stresses. Computational procedure based on two-scale model with the use of commercial finite element code is successfully constructed. The numerical results obtained by proposed method are compared with experimental results for validation.}

The aim of the work is the evaluation of hydrogen laminar flame speed correlations and turbulent flame speed closures with respect to combustion of premixed and stratified mixtures at various levels of air-to-fuel equivalence ratio. Heat-release rates derived from in-cylinder pressure traces are used for the validation of the combustion simulations. A turbulent combustion model with closures for a turbulent flame speed is investigated. The value of the computed heat-release rates mainly depends on the quality of laminar burning velocities and standard of turbulence quantities provided to the combustion model. Combustion simulations performed with experimentally derived laminar flame speed data give better results than those using laminar flame speeds obtained from a kinetic scheme. However, experimental data of hydrogen laminar flame speeds found in the literature are limited regarding the range of pressures, temperatures and air-to-fuel equivalence ratios, and do not comply with the demand of high-pressure engine-relevant conditions.}

abstract = {In this paper the characteristics and performance are described of a computational process model (CPM) of human way-finding that is based on psychological models of cognition and experimental data on human way-finding. The model comprises two modules, one for representing objectively a suburban environment and the other for representing the cognitive processes involved in navigation. The CPM is employed to simulate and investigate how spatial knowledge that has been acquired and stored is retrieved and processed in order to plan a path to a given goal. The results of the experiments carried out with NAVIGATOR are compared with the results of experiments involving young adults in real environments. We analyze the performance of NAVIGATOR in terms of its ability to find the goal, the amount of time taken to reach a given goal, the differences in performance during way-finding, and the errors in navigation, as a function of several parameters. The parameters are intended to represent key psychological components of human perceptual and cognitive systems and are derived from experimental studies of human way-finding behavior. The main value of this model lies in its use as a device for investigating and understanding human spatial performance, in terms of accurate performance and errors that arise in tasks of way-finding, and the variations among individuals in terms of performance. A set of computational experiments are used to examine the differences in search strategies between ‘individuals’. The effects of various parameters on way-finding performance are analyzed. Errors in way-finding are classified and are compared with Norman’s and Reason’s classification of errors in human performance. The CPM appears to provide a fruitful model for investigating human way-finding behavior.}

abstract = {A micromechanical model was established based on the fluid dynamics theory. This model could be used to calculate several kinds of data when the asphalt pavement under the influence of traffic loading is in water-saturated condition. The results showed that the maximum pressure inside the effective pore was located at the junction between exit slits and the pore wall. There was a positive correlation between the pressure and the vehicle speed. Therefore, the repeated traffic loading could cause emulsification, shift and even peeling of the asphalt membrane. Moreover, the bigger size of the exit slit is, the higher velocity of the fluid has. The high velocity flow keeps scouring both the exit slit and the lower boundary of pore wall. It will cause a bigger slit. Pressure distribution inside the effective pore is related to the number of the exit slit which connect with the pore. More exit slits means bigger pressure inside the effective pore. In addition, if asphalt membranes at exit slits have micro-cracking, the cumulative damage could appear easily and asphalt membranes could be peeled easily. Finally, a test was conducted so as to obtain the bonding strength and adhesion strength between asphalt and aggregate. Then, we can get accurate damage form and position during the scour process by comparing the numerical simulation results with experiment results.}

abstract = {One of the major limitations of reactivity controlled compression ignition is higher unburned hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions and lower thermal efficiency at part load operating conditions. In the present study, a combined numerical approach using a commercial three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics code CONVERGE along with artificial neural network and genetic algorithm is presented to address the above limitation. A production light-duty diesel engine is modified to run in reactivity controlled compression ignition by replacing an existing mechanical fuel injection system with a flexible electronic port fuel injection and common rail direct injection systems. The injection schedules of port fuel injection and direct injection injectors are controlled using National Instruments port and direct injection driver modules. Upon validation of combustion and emission parameters, parametric investigations are carried out to establish the effects of direct-injected diesel fuel timing start of injection (SOI), premixed fuel ratio and intake charge temperature on the engine performance and emissions in reactivity controlled compression ignition. The results obtained show that the start of injection timing and intake charge temperature significantly influence combustion phasing, while the premixed fuel ratio controls mixture reactivity and combustion quality. By utilizing the data generated with the validated computational fluid dynamics models, the artificial neural network models are trained to predict the engine exhaust emissions and efficiency. The artificial neural network models for gross indicated efficiency and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) are then coupled with genetic algorithm to maximize gross indicated efficiency while keeping the NOx and soot emissions within Euro VI emission limits. By optimizing the start of injection timing, premixed fuel ratio and intake charge temperature simultaneously using the artificial neural network models coupled with genetic algorithm, 19% improvement in gross indicated efficiency, 60% and 64% reduction in hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions, respectively, are obtained in reactivity controlled compression ignition compared to the baseline case.}

It has a critical imact on the performance and perceived quality of assembled vehicles. Using a two-dimensional finite element model, this paper presents a design-of-experiments (DOE) study of the relationships between important hemming process parameters and hem quality for aluminium alloy AA 6111-T4PD flat surface-straight edge hemming. The quality measures include roll-in/roll-out of the hem edge as well as the maximum true strain on the exposed bent surface. The finite element (FE) model combines explicit and implicit procedures in simulating the three forming subprocesses (flanging, pre-hemming, and final hemming) along with the corresponding springback (unloading). The results show that the pre-hemming die angle and the flanging die radius have the greatest influence on hem edge roll-in/roll-out, while pre-strain and the flanging die radius impact the maximum surface strain significantly. The computational DOE results also provide the basis for process parameter selection to avoid hem surface cracking and particular insights for achieving acceptable formability.}

Because of the small number of cases under study, these researchers must rely either explicitly or implicitly on counterfactual reasoning. This paper argues that computational methods provide a profitable means of carrying out rigorous counterfactual analysis. The authors advocate robustness analysis as one important part of the counterfactual analysis of formal theories. Specifically, they evaluate the robustness of the behavioral assumptions of two formal models using various heuristic search algorithms and Markov chains. They find that Kuran’s (1989) threshold model of mass protest and Ingberman’s (1985) model of direct-democracy referenda are robust to perturbations in their behavioral assumptions. These findings increase the plausibility of causal claims made by scholars who use these models to explain specific events.}

We find that the algorithm reproduces white male patriarchal structures, often simplifying, stereotyping and discriminating females and non-white individuals, while providing more positive descriptions of white men. By drawing from Bourdieu’s theory of cultural reproduction, we link these results to the attitudes of the algorithm’s designers, owners, and the dataset the algorithm was trained on. We further underpin the problematic nature of the algorithm by using the ethnographic practice of studying-up: We show how the algorithm places individuals at the top of the tech industry within the socio-cultural reality that they shaped, many times creating biased representations of them. We claim that the use of social-theoretic frameworks such as the above are able to contribute to improved algorithmic accountability, algorithmic impact assessment and provide additional and more critical depth in algorithmic bias and auditing studies. Based on the analysis, we discuss the scientific and design implications and provide suggestions for alternative ways to design just socio-algorithmic systems.}

abstract = {This workshop addressed current issues with regard to establishing a framework for the validation of quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSARs) and other computational prediction models. QSARs and related models attempt to associate physicochemical and structural properties of compounds to their biological activity. As such, they may permit the prediction of biological activity from chemical structure alone. As yet, no formal validation criteria have been agreed internationally for QSARs and related techniques. However, some general and preliminary criteria were discussed and agreed upon at a European Chemical Industry Council/International Council of Chemical Associations (CEFIC/ICCA) workshop on the regulatory acceptance of QSARs, held in Setubal, Portugal, in March 2002. These criteria were presented at a Fourth World Congress workshop, along with a proposal for the practical validation of computer models, such as QSARs.}

abstract = {Broadband noise due to the turbulence-aerofoil interaction, which is also called the leading edge noise, is one of the major noise sources of aircraft (including the engine). To study the noise properties numerically is a popular approach with the increasing power of computers. Conventional approaches of using body-fitted grids at the boundaries would be convoluted due to the complex geometries, which can constrain the efficiency of parametric studies. A promising approach to tackle this issue is to use the immersed boundary method (IBM). Among various IBM variants, the volume penalization (VP) approach employs a masking function to identify the immersed solid boundary, and continuous forcing terms are added to the original flow governing equations to account for the boundary conditions. It is, therefore, efficient and easy to implement into the existing computational aeroacoustics solvers. In this work, the VP-based IBM is used to simulate the leading edge noise by combining with the advanced synthetic turbulence method. The simulations are conducted for both the isolated aerofoils and cascade, and the results are compared with the well-validated body-fitted grid solutions. The viscosity effect is also highlighted by comparing the results obtained by solving both Euler and Navier–Stokes equations.}

abstract = {In this article, a novel tray humidifier column for humidification dehumidification desalination was proposed. The performance of the humidifier column has been investigated with experimental and computational fluid dynamics simulations. The hydrodynamics and heat transfer characteristics of this tray humidifier has been studied. A stainless steel sieve tray with a rectangular cross section with a dimension of 20 × 50 cm was used in the experimental study. In computational fluid dynamics modeling, a transient three-dimensional model has been developed based on the volume of fluid framework by using standard k-epsilon model. The effect of air and seawater flow rate and inlet seawater temperature on the exit air temperature has been investigated. The results show that the humidifier effectiveness of the tray humidifier column varies between 0.67 and 0.87 depending on operating conditions. Then, tray column can be used in humidification dehumidification desalination systems with advantages such as compact equipment, low-pressure drop, and handling solids or other sources of fouling.}
