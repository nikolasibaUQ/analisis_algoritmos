abstract = {With the vastly increased capabilities of computers within the past decade the teaching of thermodynamics and fluid dynamics must evolve to encompass more treatment of numerical methods than before. Accepting that CFD will occupy a significant portion of undergraduate and postgraduate syllabuses in the 1990s, this paper looks at certain conceptual difficulties associated with conventional approaches in CFD and the impact of these on thermofluids education. An alternative approach to CFD which avoids complicated mathematics is described. It is argued that such an approach can promote a better understanding of fluid behavioural mechanisms and, thereby, should be of benefit to both research and teaching in thermofluids.}

abstract = {Background: Women and people of color are consistently underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields and careers. Though there are myriad factors underlying these gaps, one potential variable may be the extent to which these students feel connected to their STEM classroom experiences. Purpose: The present study investigated the potential of a service-learning experience to support STEM engagement for underrepresented youth. Methodology/Approach: Two cohorts of high school students participated in a summer program through which they built “solar suitcases” to provide electricity for communities in need. Observations and student surveys measured student engagement and changes in STEM attitudes, dispositions, and beliefs. Findings/Conclusions: Students were highly engaged in service-learning activities and demonstrated improved Science Fascination, Science Values, and STEM Career Affinity after participating in the program. Implications: Implications for the design and delivery of culturally relevant service-learning experiences are discussed.}

While assessing the effectiveness of these protective measures, different injury criteria had to be defined and/or employed, their values calculated (during the initial response stage of the blast event), and compared with the limiting values corresponding to the critical levels of injury. The efficacies are compared both when these measures are implemented in isolation and in the presence of other protective measures with respect to specific injuries.}

abstract = {System knowledge and reasoning mechanisms are essential means for intellectualization of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). As enablers of system intelligence, they make such systems able to solve application problems and to maintain their efficient operation. Normally, system intelligence has a human-created initial part and a system-produced (extending) part, called synthetic system intelligence (SSI). This position paper claims that SSI can be converted to a new industrial asset and utilized as such. Unfortunately, no overall theory of SSI exists and its conceptual framework, management strategy, and computational methodologies are still in a premature stage. This is the main reason why no significant progress has been achieved in this field, contrary to the latent potentials. This paper intends to contribute to: (i) understanding the nature and fundamentals of SSI, (ii) systematizing the elicitation and transfer of SSI, (iii) exploration of analogical approaches to utilization of SSI, and (iv) road-mapping and scenario development for the exploitation of SSI as an industrial asset. First, the state of the art is surveyed and the major findings are presented. Then, four families of analogical approaches to SSI transfer are analyzed. These are: (i) knowledge transfer based on repositories, (ii) transfer among agents, (iii) transfer of learning resources, and (iv) transfer by emerging approaches. A procedural framework is proposed that identifies the generic functionalities needed for a quasi-autonomous handling of SSI as an industrial asset. The last section casts light on some important open issues and necessary follow-up research and development activities.}

abstract = {There are two conflicting views about the nature of thought: it is invariably rational or invariably irrational. Bartlett argued that thinking is a high level skill, and this idea suggests an obvious third possibility: thought is sometimes rational and sometimes irrational. This view is defended in the present paper, which argues that the doctrine of logical infallibility is either falsified by the results of some experiments on syllogistic reasoning or else empirically vacuous. There is no need to postulate a mental logic of the sort that Piaget and others have proposed. The rapid implicit inferences of daily life depend on the ability to interpret sentences by constructing mental models of the states of affairs that they describe. Deliberate deductions depend on the further ability to search for alternative models that violate putative conclusions. All that you need to know to assess validity is the fundamental semantic principle of deduction: an inference is valid if, and only if, its conclusion is true in every situation in which its premises are true and there is no way of interpreting the premises so as to render the conclusion false. This principle guides the construction of all logics though it is not explicitly stated in any of them. The paper concludes by examining the ways in which people differ in their ability to reason, the practical need to improve this ability, and some of the pedagogical implications of the present studies.}

Each child was given a series of tasks so that we might assess their thinking across four areas of mathematics: number facts, story problems, place value, and written calculation. Children with MD/RD performed significantly worse than NA children in most areas of mathematical thinking, whereas children with MD only performed worse than NA children only on complex story problems. The MD-only group outperformed the MD/RD group on story problems and written calculation. No significant differences were found between the RD-only and NA groups on any of the tasks. The results suggested that among children with mathematics difficulties, the MD/RD subgroup is distinct from the MD-only subgroup, with the former being characterized by pervasive deficiencies in mathematical thinking and the latter by more specific deficits in problem solving.}

The argument is this: Does the human cognitive system use symbols as a representation of knowledge, and does it process symbols and their respective constituents? Or does the human cognitive system use a distributed representation of knowledge, and is it somehow capable of processing this distributed representation of knowledge in a complex and meaningful way? This paper argues for an integrated symbolic and sub-symbolic approach to the representation of cognition. The lines of reasoning used as evidence to bolster this argument for an integrated approach are the cognitive architecture the Adaptive Character of Thought-Rational (ACT-R), and biology, where it is argued that symbolic and sub-symbolic representations of cognition are part of an intellectual continuum, with sub-symbolic representations at the low end and symbolic representations at the higher end.}

abstract = {In the conveying process of a solid–liquid two-phase medium, the wear of the flow passage components is unavoidable. In this study, the solid–liquid two-phase flow in a centrifugal pump was numerically simulated by computational fluid dynamics–discrete element method coupling. For particle diameters up to 3 mm, the particle–particle and particle–wall interactions were considered in the simulation. Two-phase performance and wear experiments for different flow rates and particle concentrations were conducted. The wear experiment was carried out for 48 h at each mass concentration. In these experiments, a paint film method was used to display the wear position, and the wall thickness of the flow passage was measured using an ultrasonic thickness gauge. The results show that the instantaneous wear rate of the impeller, volute, and wear plate in the pump changed periodically with the impeller rotation. The volute wall wear was related to the particle movement. With the increase in the particle mass concentration, the wear rate increased. However, the rate of increase of the wear rate decreased because the particles moved to the wall in the volute to form a particle layer. Increasing the concentration did not linearly increase the effect of the particles on the wall.}

abstract = {This article is motivated by the fact that in Cape Town, South Africa, approximately 7.5 million people live in informal settlements and focuses on potential upgrading strategies for such sites. To this end, we developed a computational method for rapid urban design prototyping. The corresponding planning tool generates urban layouts including street network, blocks, parcels and buildings based on an urban designer’s specific requirements. It can be used to scale and replicate a developed urban planning concept to fit different sites. To facilitate the layout generation process computationally, we developed a new data structure to represent street networks, land parcellation, and the relationship between the two. We also introduced a nested parcellation strategy to reduce the number of irregular shapes generated due to algorithmic limitations. Network analysis methods are applied to control the distribution of buildings in the communities so that preferred neighborhood relationships can be considered in the design process. Finally, we demonstrate how to compare designs based on various urban analysis measures and discuss the limitations that arise when we apply our method in practice, especially when dealing with more complex urban design scenarios.}

We then focus on experimental evidence gathered within the paradigm of cognitive bias modification (CBM). Although CBM has generated considerable interest in relation to anxiety and depression, it has only recently emerged in the field of rumination. After considering the purpose and possible advantages of CBM procedures, we review CBM work related to rumination and discuss key limitations and implications within this developing area of research. Among our recommendations, we outline ways to contrast and integrate cognitive theories of rumination, as well as to obtain stronger bias modification procedures.}

It is argued that this phenomenon, here called intermittent divergence, is rooted in a special kind of interaction between perception and imagination, and that this interaction has specific experiential requirements. Three requirements are defined. The resulting new theory then provides a framework for the critical analysis of conventional digital modeling and parametric modeling. Conventional modeling methods are shown to satisfy the requirements for intermittent divergence, while parametric modeling methods are shown to undermine them. The article concludes that parametric systems, as currently developed, could inhibit rather than augment this important route to creativity. Additionally, the article questions prevailing beliefs about the computer support of creativity, including the premise that sketching is an ideal creative medium and the premise that ambiguity in graphical depictions is key to the support of creativity. The theory offers an alternative view on these issues.}

This work expands the media planning literature that has narrowly focused on thematic (in)congruency. Focusing on music videos, Study 1 empirically tests the affect regulation effect on consumer response to ads paired with emotionally incongruent music videos and the affect priming effect in congruent pairings. Furthermore, this study incorporates affective computing algorithms to pair ads with music videos based on emotional (in)congruency to advance the emerging field of computational advertising. The results from two experimental studies demonstrate that consumers prefer the emotional flow from a negative to a positive state when the ad and media context are emotionally incongruent. In the emotional congruency condition, regardless of ad position, the positively valenced ad produces more favorable responses. Study 2 further illuminates the boundary conditions of emotional (in)congruency and ad valence, suggesting that consumers’ preference for positively valenced ads in the affect regulation and affect priming processes is more prominent when consumers are less involved. When involvement level is high, negative ads are rated as more persuasive than positive ones. Involvement level also reduces ad skipping, especially when the ad and the media program are emotionally incongruent.}

abstract = {The flexion effect of a flexible wing during the hovering flight is systematically studied by using computer simulations when Reynolds number is kept at 140. The aerodynamic forces and flow vortex are investigated by solving the two-dimensional time-dependent incompressible Navier–Stokes equations using the finite volume method. The wing is modelled as a thin plate which has a rigid leading portion and a flexible aft part. The simulations are performed for a variation of the location of rotational centre and the amplitude of the flexion, and the corresponding changes of the aerodynamic forces and vortex shedding mechanism in the wake structure are investigated. Form the quantitative comparisons, the present simulations reveal that a moderate flexion during the hovering fly can provide a better performance for a flapping wing, while an excessive flexion will lead the aerodynamic performance become worse. Though the flexion does not change the force trace of the hovering wing, the magnitude of the instantaneous peak forces and mean periodic forces are definitely changed by the chordwise deformation. Compared with a rigid hovering wing, the dynamic flexion during hovering alters the intensity of the leading edge vorticity and the transfer direction of the wake. Here, the present results indicate that the aerodynamic forces can be altered by adding some deformation characteristics to the trailing edge of the wing. Furthermore, the appropriate flexion can be used to alter the aerodynamic performance of a wing and will be helpful for design and control of the flexible microflying vehicles.}
