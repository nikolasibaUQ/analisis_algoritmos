abstract = {This article suggests to quantitative methodologists that the tools that they use (and often others they do not) are more broadly applicable than is often assumed; to reflexivist researchers that there are many more tools available to their research than are often seen as appropriate; and to the IR discipline writ large that most of the disciplinary thinking about the relationships between research, ontology, epistemology, methodology and methods is unnecessarily narrow. Our core goal is to reveal the problematically inaccurate nature of both the qualitative/quantitative and the positivist/post-positivist divides, as well as of traditional methods training. We suggest that the ability to pair, and the utility of pairing, quantitative (traditionally neopositivist) methods with critical (traditionally non-neopositivist) theorising makes this intervention. To this end, the article begins with discussions of the relationships between epistemology and method in IR research. We continue on to frame a disunity of social science in the quantitative/qualitative divide, which lays the groundwork for a section rethinking traditional understandings of how methods, methodology, and epistemology relate. We then make the case for the utility of methods traditionally classified as ‘quantitative’ for critical research in IR. The article concludes by discussing the transformative implications of this understanding for critical theorising, and for theorising knowledge within disciplinary IR.}

abstract = {This paper compares the use of scripting languages and visual programming languages for teaching computational design concepts to novice and advanced architecture students. Both systems are described and discussed in terms of the representation methods they use. With novice students better results were obtained with the visual programming language. However, the generative strategies used were restricted to parametric variation and the use of randomness. Scripting, on the other hand, was used by advanced students to implement rule-based generative systems. It is possible to conclude that visual languages can be very useful for making architecture students understand general programming concepts, but scripting languages are fundamental for implementing generative design systems. The paper also discusses the importance of the ability to shift between different representation methods, from more concrete to more abstract, as part of the architectural education.}

abstract = {The study presents unique teaching approach for generating a parametric modular facade fabrication for first-year students in visual design module using a computational visual coding method based on Truchet Tiles. The method followed four main phases: exploring tiling, testing connectivity, fabrication, and assembly. Shape grammar was considered during the design principles implementation to respond to climatic behavior. Space-filling shapes method known as the “Generalized Abeille Tiles” was followed to ensure tiling connectivity. The experimentation involves manual folding techniques without any software. A survey was conducted among first-year and fourth-year students post-introduction to computational software. The results showed a wide range of alternative geometries with different self-shading patterns generated. It highlighted that facade fabrication aided students in comprehending computational logic, easing the understanding of computational software complexity. This pilot study emphasizes the effectiveness of teaching computational concepts in early curricula.}

abstract = {Purpose To evaluate the displacement forces acting on an aortic endograft when the iliac limbs are crossed (“ballerina” position). Methods An endograft model was computationally reconstructed based on data from a patient whose infrarenal aortic aneurysm had an endovascular stent-graft implanted with the iliac limbs crossed. Computational fluid dynamics analysis determined the maximum displacement force on the endograft and separately on the bifurcation and iliac limbs. Its analogue model was reconstructed for comparison, assuming the neck, main body, and total length constant but considering the iliac limbs to be deployed in the usual bifurcated mode. Calculations were repeated after developing “idealized” models of both the bifurcated and crossed-limbs endografts with straight main bodies and no neck angulation or curved iliac segments. Results The vector of the total force was directed anterocaudal for both the typical bifurcated and the crossed-limbs configurations, with the forces in the latter slightly reduced and the vertical component accounting for most of the force in both configurations. Idealized crossed-limbs and bifurcated configurations differed only in the force on the iliac limbs, but this difference disappeared in the realistic models. Conclusion Crossing of the iliac limbs can slightly affect the direction of the displacement forces. Although this configuration can exert larger forces on the limbs than in the bifurcated mode, this effect can be blunted by concomitant modifications in the geometry of the main body and other parts of the endograft, making its hemodynamic behavior resemble that of a typically positioned endograft.}

abstract = {Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) has been shown to be an effective technology for reducing the airborne bioburden in indoor environments and is already advocated as a potential infection control measure for healthcare settings. However, much of the understanding of UVGI performance is based on experimental studies or numerical simulation in mechanically ventilated environments. This study considers the application of an upper-room UVGI system in a naturally ventilated multi-bed hospital ward. A computational fluid dynamics model is used to simulate a Nightingale-type hospital ward with wind-driven cross-ventilation and three wall-mounted UVGI fixtures. A parametric study considering 50 different fixture configurations and three ventilation rates was carried out using a design of experiments approach. Each configuration was assessed by calculating the UV dose distribution over the ward and at each bed. Results show that dose is influenced by the location of the fixtures and the ventilation regime. Thermal effects are likely to be important at low ventilation rates and may reduce UV effectiveness. A metamodel-based numerical optimisation was applied at a ventilation rate of 6 air changes per hour. In this case, the optimum result is achieved when UVGI fixtures are mounted on the leeward wall at their lowest mounting height.}

abstract = {Lateral ankle instability, resulting from the inability of ankle ligaments to heal after injury, is believed to cause a change in the articular contact mechanics that may promote cartilage degeneration. Considering that lateral ligaments’ insufficiency has been related to rotational instability of the talus, and that few studies have addressed the contact mechanics under this condition, the aim of this work was to evaluate if a purely rotational ankle instability could cause non-physiological changes in contact pressures in the ankle joint cartilages using the ﬁnite element method. A finite element model of a healthy ankle joint, including bones, cartilages and nine ligaments, was developed. Pure internal talus rotations of 3.67°, 9.6° and 13.43°, measured experimentally for three ligamentous configurations, were applied. The ligamentous configurations consisted in a healthy condition, an injured condition in which the anterior talofibular ligament was cut, and an injured condition in which the anterior talofibular and calcaneofibular ligaments were cut. For all simulations, the contact areas and maximum contact pressures were evaluated for each cartilage. The results showed not only an increase of the maximum contact pressures in the ankle cartilages, but also novel contact regions at the anteromedial and posterolateral sections of the talar cartilage with increasing internal rotation. The anteromedial and posterolateral contact regions observed due to pathological internal rotations of the talus are a computational evidence that supports the link between a pure rotational instability and the pattern of pathological cartilaginous load seen in patients with long-term lateral chronic ankle instability.}

abstract = {Hand sanitization by healthcare staff remains one of the most effective ways for controlling infection in healthcare settings. However, predicting faithful adherence to Hand Hygiene Compliance (HHC) is difficult in complex environments such as inpatient hospital settings. The main challenge is understanding how different components of human and built systems interact to achieve specific goals such as HHC at the critical moments of care delivery. The aim of this explorative study was to evaluate how Human Factors derived visual salience cues and proximity-compatibility principles might be used in the design of healthcare spaces to support nurse moments of HHC through increased perceived behavioral control and intention. The investigative team used a Collaborative Computational Scenario Planning (CCSP) Model approach to determine the integrative effects of reinforcing and detracting operational and environmental factors on discrete moments of HHC behavior. Supervised Machine Learning analysis was conducted on data collected by a large academic medical center that included HHC observance in clinical staff spanning from 2017 to 2021 in two inpatient hospital units. The probabilistic outcomes of unit based HHC observance likelihood were used to compute Fuzzy Cognitive Model Edge Probabilities between Hand Hygiene (HH) cues and detected HHC at key moments. Hospital infection control experts were then engaged to identify the weight of various reinforcing and detracting operational and environmental factors contributing to HHC observance. Combining the quantitative and qualitative methods, allowed the team to then develop integrative CCSP models which facilitated predictive insight into the development of targeted environmental improvements that might contribute to HHC control and intention to support safer patient care.}

abstract = {The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in journalism has sparked complex ethical debates, particularly with the rise of generative AI systems. By now, AI permeates the entire news cycle, from information gathering to news dissemination, raising questions revolving around issues such as transparency, accountability, responsibility, bias, and diversity. Previous research showed that news organizations have slowly approached and adapted to ethical concerns regarding the use of AI, developing critical stances mainly due to rising AI power, growing audience skepticism, and mounting tensions within the industry between news publishers’ strategies and journalists’ anxieties. Consequently, ethical guidelines have started to emerge in news organizations, but their practical application remains challenging and under-studied, not only due to the opacity of AI algorithms, but also due to the difficulties of “embedding” journalistic values into AI systems. In the light of an intensifying discourse about ethical concerns in the news industry and growing efforts by governments and institutions such as the European Union to strengthen AI governance, journalism studies have started to explore the issue as well. However, research on AI ethics is still in its infancy, with significant gaps in understanding the practical enforcement of ethical guidelines within newsrooms, in particular when it comes to the design of AI systems. This essay critically discusses the way journalism (studies) approach ethical issues related to the use and the design of AI systems, given that the responsible use and design of AI systems in journalism is crucial given its integral role for democracy and society.}

To randomize each respondent to a group and treatment and to test of several hypotheses simultaneously, two by two factorial design was used. An online survey (N = 1160) on Iranian social media revealed that overclaiming and social approval are positively related to sharing fake news on social media. Surprisingly, analytical thinking yielded no significance. We believe that in order to show more knowledge users tend to share information with high social approval irrespective of their credibility. Although CRT proved no relation with sharing, significant differences among male and female users were found. The proven relation between sharing more and overclaiming more reveals a marketing opportunity. Gamification of communication which provides a vehicle for users to overclaim their knowledge to their peers on social media might be a suitable strategy on social media to spread the message.}

The aim of this analysis is to find the statistical characteristics of the mixture heterogeneity in a turbulent flowfield for moderating the PCCI combustion and for increasing an output limit, which is restricted by a severe knock. Several different initial conditions of heterogeneity of an air-fuel or air-fuel-EGR gas mixture were given at the intake valve closing time by a new method, which generated statistically reasonable turbulent fluctuations in both velocity and fuel mass fraction fields. The autoignition and combustion behaviours were analysed for several different sets of the r.m.s. and the length scale of the fluctuations in the fuel mass fraction. The analyses show that the combination of a larger r.m.s. value and a longer-length scale of the fluctuations in fuel mass fraction is effective to slow the combustion in a hot flame reaction phase and to avoid knocking. The analytical results also show that the heterogeneous distribution of an EGR gas has a considerable effect in making the combustion slower, even when a fuel-air mixture is homogeneous.}

abstract = {Due to the low electricity prices in central Europe, cost optimisations related to all parts of a new hydropower plant have become increasingly important. In case of a run-of-river hydropower plant using a vertical axis Kaplan turbine, one of the cost drivers are the excavation works. Thus, a decisive factor for the reduction of construction costs is the minimisation of the construction depth of the elbow-type draft tube. In course of the design phase of a new hydropower plant in Austria, an analysis of the impact of draft tube modifications on the performance of the Kaplan turbine was carried out by applying computational fluid dynamics. The net head of the turbine with a diameter of D = 3.15 m accounts for Hnet = 9.00 m and the maximum discharge per unit is Qmax = 57.5 m3/s. After it was proven that there is a good agreement of the numerically calculated and experimentally measured turbine efficiency for the original turbine configuration, various draft tube designs were tested in order to find out their impact on the turbine efficiency and to analyse the sources of draft tube losses in detail. Finally, it was possible to find a new draft tube design representing a compromise of reduced construction costs and acceptable turbine efficiency.}

abstract = {Although the learning of programming language is critical in science and technology education, it might be difficult for some students, especially novices. One possible reason might be the fact that programming language, especially for three-dimensional (3D) applications, is too complex and abstract for these students to understand. Programming for 3D applications requires understanding the spatial relationship of 3D objects and hence needs a visualization technique more. In view of this, this article presents an augmented reality (AR)-enhanced learning system that offers visual representation and interactivity to help students learn programming for 3D applications. To examine the influences of such an AR-enhanced system on student learning, a within-group experiment with 34 college students was conducted. All students used both of an AR-enhanced version and an ordinary version. The findings revealed that the AR-enhanced version made students have better learning efficiency than the ordinary system. In addition, the AR-enhanced system also made students have enhanced perceptions in terms of system usability, flow experience, and usage perception. Based on the results, further development of AR-enhanced learning systems is also suggested and discussed.}
