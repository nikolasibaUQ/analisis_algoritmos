abstract = {Abstract Since ballistic and blast survivability and off-road handling and stability of military vehicles, such as the high-mobility multi-purpose wheeled vehicle (HMMWV), are two critical vehicle performance aspects, they both (including the delicate balance between them) have to be considered when a new vehicle is being designed or an existing vehicle retrofitted (e.g. up-armoured). Finite-element-based transient non-linear dynamics and multi-body longitudinal dynamics computational analyses were employed, relatively, in the present work to address the following two specific aspects of the performance of an HMMWV: first, the ability of the vehicle to survive detonation of a landmine shallow buried into sand underneath the right wheel of the vehicle and, second, the ability of the vehicle to withstand a simple straight-line brake manoeuvre during off-road travel without compromising its stability and safety of its occupants. Within the first analysis, the kinematic and structural responses (including large-scale rotation and deformation, buckling, plastic yielding, failure initiation, fracture, and fragmentation) of the HMMWV to the detonation of a landmine were analysed computationally using the general-purpose transient non-linear dynamics analysis software ABAQUS/Explicit. The second analysis was carried out using Simpack, a general-purpose multi-body dynamics program, and the main purpose of this analysis was to address the vehicle stability during the off-road travel. The same sand model was used in both types of analysis. Finally, the computational results obtained are compared with general field-test observations and data in order to judge the physical soundness and fidelity of the present approach.}

abstract = {Big data analytics (BDA) enhances knowledge and decision-making. Despite its importance, the connection between technical progress and political change is neglected in the administrative process. Most studies focus on e-government, e-governance, and how technology can improve existing operations of the bureaucracy. However, this article aims to explore the potential of BDA for public policy systems and provide a linkage for the transformation toward digital and smart governance using preferred reported items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) approach to reveal the relevant documents and narrative review approach to interpret the application of BDA at each step of the public policy system. In addition, this study identifies several common public policy-related big data sources and techniques that could be used at the various stages of the public policy process. This study argues that BDA has the potential to be used for policy formulation in the four main phases—planning, design, service delivery, and evaluation. Most studies confirm its potential in the policy process for taxation, health, education, transportation, law, economy, and social system. This study reveals that it is also suitable for public policy execution stages, such as public supervision, public regulation, service delivery, and policy feedback. Previous studies have indicated that the application of BDA can transform traditional or manual governance systems into digital and smart governance. We contend that the policy cycle should be seen as a dynamic and iterative process characterized by continuous evolution. Though each step of transformation has its unique challenges in handling BDA and maintaining the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure, it can ensure an accurate, prompt, and context-oriented public policy system. These insights provide a novel outlook on effectively managing the interplay between innovation and traditional approaches in the realm of public policy development.}

abstract = {Emergent phenomena—those that manifest bottom-up from the psychological characteristics, perceptions, and interactions among individuals—are a fundamental dynamic process in multilevel theory, but have been treated in a very limited way in the research literature. In particular, treatments are largely assumed (rather than observed directly), retrospective, and static. This paper describes a research paradigm designed to examine directly the dynamics of micro-meso—individual, dyad, and team—emergent phenomena. We identify, describe, and illustrate the sequence of theoretical, measurement, computational, data analytic, and systematic research activities that are necessary to operationalize and utilize the paradigm. We illustrate the paradigm development process using our research, focused on learning and team knowledge emergence, and highlight key design principles that can be applied to examine other emergent phenomena in teams. We conclude with a discussion of contributions, strengths and limitations, and generalization of the approach to other emergent phenomena in teams.}

By utilizing Mathcad and/or Excel, students can be taught to create a set of psychrometric-related functions that can greatly diminish the number of calculations required to tackle design-oriented problems. By doing this, two levels of conceptual understanding are enhanced. First, students gain an appreciation of the basic psychrometric processes for buildings when creating specific functions in Mathcad/Excel, and second, students gain the ability to create automated worksheets for specific applications, allowing them to see immediate results to variations in input design conditions, as well as on different parameters. Feedback from students, as well as class instructors, demonstrates that the use of these tools enhance the student experience in an air conditioning class and make the course more dynamic and engaging.}

Fire modelling is complex due to the interaction between chemistry, heat transfer and fluid dynamics. Commercially available simulation tools necessarily simplify this complexity, excluding less fundamental processes, such as soot production. By not including this compound in the simulations, the interactions of radiation heat transfer, fire propagation and toxicity must be approximated based on input parameters that are often not well defined. In this work, two semi-empirical soot models are incorporated in the fire dynamics simulator. The models are compared against experimental data. For the operational viability in large-scale scenarios, a correction factor for the local variables is proposed as a function of the cell size, achieving good agreement with experimental data in terms of the amount of soot generated.}

The use of computational and experimental approaches greatly enhanced the understanding of how the actuators worked as well enabled the program to be completed for a lower cost than if either the modelling or the experiments had been neglected. Wind tunnel experiments were used with computational fluid dynamics results to provide aerodynamic coefficients for six-degree of freedom (6-DOF) simulations. The 6-DOF simulations were used to predict the performance of the projectile in the range, thus ensuring that good range data were acquired and reducing the necessary number of set-up rounds. It was found that there were cases where experimental methods were necessary, although the modelling provided the researchers with a greater detail of flow interactions and provided forces that were difficult to measure.}

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNA molecules that regulate transcriptional and posttranscriptional gene regulation of the cell. Experimental evidence shows that miRNAs have a direct role in different cellular processes, such as immune function, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. In a viral infection context, miRNAs have been connected with the interplay between host and pathogen, occupying a major role in pathogenesis. While numerous viral miRNAs from DNA viruses have been identified, characterization of functional RNA virus-encoded miRNAs and their potential targets is still ongoing. Here, we used an in silico approach to analyze dengue Virus genome sequences. Pre-miRNAs were extracted through VMir software, and the identification of putative pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs was accessed using Support Vector Machine web tools. The targets were scanned using miRanda software and functionally annotated using ClueGo. Via computational tools, eight putative miRNAs were found to hybridize with numerous targets of morphogenesis, differentiation, migration, and growth pathways that may play a major role in the interaction of the virus and its host. Future approaches will focus on experimental validation of their presence and target messenger RNA genes to further elucidate their biological functions in human and mosquito cells.}

Furthermore, although there is some evidence indicating that compared with female students, male students’ perceptions of science utility are higher in relation to more inquiry-based instruction, overall, the weight of evidence clearly leans toward the conclusion that the attitudes of students from different gender and racial/ethnic backgrounds are similarly associated with greater exposure to inquiry-based instruction in both their science and mathematics classrooms.}

In this paper, numerical studies are done to investigate the supersonic combustion of hydrogen and air co-flow in presence of the ramp edge. In this study, flame maintenance and combustion formation in a dual-combustion ramjet engine are fully investigated. The primary emphasis of this work is to disclose the impact of produced shocks due to the existence of ramp edge on the structure of fuel and air-jet immediately downstream of injector. The shock interactions of two different angles (10 deg and 30 deg) of the ramp edge are investigated. Favre-averaged conservation equations are considered for the simulation of compressible flows inside the combustor. Various mechanisms expressing the flame spreading characteristics are also examined. Depending on the angle of the ramp edge, the produced shock waves influence on size and strength of vortices. Our findings also show that high angles of ramp edge augment the fluctuation of the vortices by the splitter and consequently, fuel mixing enhances in the combustion chamber of ramjet engine. Our findings also confirm that the similar jet pressure would be more effective on the vortex production downstream of the splitter. The application of ramp edge with angle of 30 deg would increase average momentum thickness of the mixing layer up to 55%.}

abstract = {The process of coating textiles with a blade coater has been investigated with CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) software. The simulations have uncovered a pressure drop in the area between the edge of the knife and the textile. This drop can be explained by the varying height of the flow channel which is made of the knife and the textile in conjunction with the no slip condition that is applied to the walls. In the simulations this drop became arbitrarily deep with increasing viscosity leading to negative absolute pressure levels. This may be a hint that the no slip condition is not valid in this scenario that involves shear rates of the order of 103/s and dynamic viscosities of around 10 to 100Pas. With a proposed slip condition for the textile the pressure drop became less pronounced. At the same time the flow rate through the gap between knife and textile was reduced leading to a thinner coating. This can be a hint that a slip between coating material and textile can cause distortions in the coating up to a complete disruption which is reported frequently by the industry. This could eventually be avoided by reducing the varying height of the flow channel. Alternatively a vertical lift of the textile due to the negative pressure was taken into account. This lift appeared only with low tensions of the textile of about 1N/m and showed no influence on coating thickness and pressure drop.}

A state-of-the-art engine computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool was used to explore the influences of the physical and chemical properties of diesel and gasoline-like fuels (no. 91 gasoline and E10) on spray development, auto-ignition and combustion processes, and pollutant formation. The CFD simulation results were found to be consistent with available experimental measurements, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results indicate that gasoline-like fuels are able to achieve better premixed charge in CI engines owing to their higher volatility and lower ignitability compared to diesel fuel, which promotes efficient, clean, and low temperature combustion. However, the high combustion pressure rise rate becomes problematic under some circumstances, especially for high octane number fuels, such as E10. Both previous experimental measurements and the present numerical results show that gasoline-like fuels have great potential to be used in future CI engines, but the injection strategies and injection system have to be optimized based on the fuel properties.}

abstract = {Climate change has the potential to displace large populations in many parts of the developed and developing world. Understanding why, how, and when environmental migrants decide to move is critical to successful strategic planning within organizations tasked with helping the affected groups, and mitigating their systemic impacts. One way to support planning is through the employment of computational modeling techniques. Models can provide a window into possible futures, allowing planners and decision makers to test different scenarios in order to understand what might happen. While modeling is a powerful tool, it presents both opportunities and challenges. This paper builds a foundation for the broader community of model consumers and developers by: providing an overview of pertinent climate-induced migration research, describing some different types of models and how to select the most relevant one(s), highlighting three perspectives on obtaining data to use in said model(s), and the consequences associated with each. It concludes with two case studies based on recent research that illustrate what can happen when ambitious modeling efforts are undertaken without sufficient planning, oversight, and interdisciplinary collaboration. We hope that the broader community can learn from our experiences and apply this knowledge to their own modeling research efforts.}

Calculations conducted on the baseline airfoil showed excellent agreement with measurements on the same airfoil with the same specified conditions. Furthermore, a more widespread comparison with an advanced potential theory code is presented. The influence of various key parameters, such as flap shape, flap size and oscillating frequencies, was investigated so that an optimum design can be suggested for application with wind turbine blades. It is concluded that a moderately curved flap with flap chord to airfoil curve ratio between 0.05 and 0.10 would be an optimum choice.}
