abstract = {This study aims to predict the overall aerodynamic performance, unsteady forces and the tonal noise radiation from a small axial flow fan. The computation is divided into two stages: (a) the computation of the unsteady flow field at design and off-design working conditions, and (b) detailed analysis of the acoustic field. A dual-time scheme for dealing with rotor-stator or wake-struts interactions in turbomachinery environments by introducing a pseudo-time to represent the time variation of source terms and the finite volume control method are applied for the unsteady solutions involving the whole flow passages of the axial flow fan, and the pressure rise against volume flow rate is obtained and shown to be in good agreement with experimental data. The interaction of the rotor wake and the downstream struts has been simulated by investigating the effects of source distribution over the whole blades. And the tonal noise is then predicted based on Lowson’s theory. The unsteady force is divided into thrust in the rotational axis direction and drag in the rotational direction for the rotor and struts. It is demonstrated that the unsteady forces acting on the rotor and struts are produced by the interaction between them, and has a close relationship with the rotor wake structure and the strut alignment. In the rotor near wake, both the viscous and potential flow is dominant not only to aerodynamic forces but also to interaction noise. The present study shows that the higher lean angle of struts can gain about 4 dB reduction of overall sound power level compared to the smallest one.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The emotional management of workers can not only increase the efficiency of work, but also contribute to the improvement of the productivity of a company. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review surveyed the literature to identify the relationship between postural expression and emotion during sedentary tasks. METHODS: We searched relevant literature published up to December 1, 2019 using seven electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore, and MEDLINE Complete). RESULTS: A total of 14 publications were included in this scoping review. It was found that the application of pressure sensor and camera-based measurement equipment was effective. Additionally, it was proposed to predict the emotional state of the worker by using forward and backward movements as the main variable as opposed to left and right movements. The information-based analysis technique was able to further increase the accuracy of workers’ emotion prediction. CONCLUSIONS: The emotion prediction of workers based on sitting posture could be confirmed for certain movements, and the information-based technical method could further increase the accuracy of prediction. Expansion of information-based technical research will further increase the possibility of predicting the emotions of workers based on posture, and this will in turn promote safer and more efficient work performance.}

abstract = {Since programming processes involve different thinking skills and different fields of knowledge, it is especially important for children to acquire 21st-century skills. Even though the programming education activities are being intensively applied, it can be said that there is a gap in quantitative researches supporting the effort to reveal the direct or indirect effectiveness of the learning–teaching processes for the programming education. This study, which was done to fill this gap, aims to examine the degree to which students learn programming concepts (PC) and to identify effective variables in that process with a developed curriculum for gifted students studying in the second–third–fourth grade in primary schools. For this purpose, a 15-week application was carried out and each student developed an individual project. In the study, a criterion list, observation forms and peer evaluations were used based on PC to examine projects and learning process. The scores obtained from these tools were used to examine the application of each participant, to comment on the effective variables and the adequacy of the teaching process. The evidence from this study intimates that female participants obtained higher scores than male ones in programming education. Those scores are higher in 9 and 10 age group of students than others. Those who haven’t had Internet access, who have never used computer or have had access to Internet as well as who haven’t had any computer courses had lower scores than others. The upshot of this is that previous computer technology experiences of students may have affected the scores obtained programming education process.}

abstract = {Hysteretic damping of a material or structure loaded within its elastic region is the dissipation of mechanical energy at a rate independent of the frequency of vibration while at the same time directly proportional to the square of the displacement. Generally, reproducing this frequency-independent damping can be computationally complex and requires prior knowledge of the system’s natural frequencies or the full time history of the system’s response. In this paper, a new model and numerical procedure are proposed whereby hysteretic material damping is achieved in the time domain. The proposed procedure is developed based on modifying the viscous model through a correction factor calculated exclusively using the local response. The superiority of the proposed approach lies in its ability to capture material hysteresis without any knowledge of the eigen- or modal frequencies of the system and without knowledge of the past time history of the system’s response or the characteristics of any excitation forces. A numerical procedure is also presented for implementing the proposed model in vibration analysis. The simplicity of the approach enables its generalisation to continuous systems and to systems of multi-degrees of freedom as demonstrated herein. The proposed model is presented as a correction to the viscous damping model which makes it attractive to implement into commercial finite element package using user-defined element subroutines as demonstrated in this study.}

abstract = {The concept of water quality has often generally revolved around the all-round safety of water for human consumption. The quality of much of the 3% of the earth’s humanly consumable water classed as freshwater is under threat of climate change, rising population numbers, indiscriminate land usage, detrimental agricultural practices and contamination from poor waste management. The need for optimal water quality enhancement has become more germane to sustainable socio-economic development. This paper examines the evolution of efforts made by the scientific community over the years to ensure water quality can be characterized and properly managed to ensure the global ever-growing demand for clean water for human consumption is continually met. The development of state-of-the-art computational decision support systems (DSS) should play a vital role. However, efforts in this regard are currently bedevilled by major challenges such as quantifying, measuring, processing and controlling the numerous metrics of water quality, as well as their adaptation and integration into a fully developed universal water quality model. In addressing these challenges, a shift towards simpler modelling approaches and the integration of uni-purpose models which can be cascaded into decision-making systems is being popularly proposed. However, with technological advancements already stimulating a water quality management revolution, there is a shift in paradigm to more universal modelling attempts with great optimism towards overcoming the challenges of developing universal water quality models and DSS. The prospects and opportunities of a water quality management renaissance offered by radical scientific innovations look promising, as the world races with time to provide support systems that can help deal better with the dynamics of sustainable water supply in increasingly contaminable environments and progressively unpredictable climates.}

Affordances as perceived action possibilities with specific valence may be cast into predicted policy-relative goodness and modeled as GVFs. A systematic explication of this connection shows that GVFs and especially their deep-learning embodiments (1) realize affordance prediction as a form of direct perception, (2) illuminate the fundamental connection between action and perception in affordance, and (3) offer a scalable way to learn affordances using RL methods. Through an extensive review of existing literature on GVF applications and representative affordance research in robotics, we demonstrate that GVFs provide the right framework for learning affordances in real-world applications. In addition, we highlight a few new avenues of research opened up by the perspective of “affordance as GVF,” including using GVFs for orchestrating complex behaviors.}

abstract = {Peripheral access cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is initiated with percutaneous cannulae (CTRL) and venous drainage is often impeded due to smaller vessel and cannula size. A new cannula (Smartcanula ®, SC) was developed which can change shape in situ and, therefore, may improve venous drainage. Its performance was evaluated using a 2-D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The Navier-Stokes equations could be simplified due to the fact that we use a steady state and a 2-dimensional system while the equation of continuity (ρ constant) was also simplified. We compared the results of the SC to the CTRL using CFDRC® (Version 6.6, CFDRC research corporation, Huntsville, USA) at two preloads (300 and 700 Pa). The SC’s mass flow rate outperformed the CTRL by 12.1% and 12.2% at a pressures of 300 and 700 Pa, respectively. At 700 Pa, a pressure gradient of 50% was measured for the CTRL and 11% for the SC. The mean velocity at the 700 Pa for the CTRL was 1.0 m.s-1 at exit while the SC showed an exit velocity of 1.3 m.s-1. Shear rates inside the cannulae were similar between the two cannulae. In conclusion, the prototype shows greater mass flow rates compared to the classic cannula; thus, it is more efficient. This is also advocated by a better pressure gradient and higher average velocities. By reducing cannula-tip surface area or increasing hole surface area, greater flow rates are achieved.Perfusion (2007) 22, 257—265.}

Also, engagement was measured by the sum of numbers of likes and comments to each photo, and sentiment analysis of comments was conducted. Results suggest that the photos that can be categorized into “text” and “people” took the largest share in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Instagram photos. And it was found that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s major way of delivering messages on Instagram was to imprint key messages that call for actions for better health on photos and to provide the source of complementary information on text component of each post. It was also found that photos with more and bigger human faces had lower level of engagement than the others, and happiness and neutral emotions expressed on the faces in photos were negatively associated with engagement. The features whose high value would make the photos look splendid and gaudy were negatively correlated with engagement, but sharpness was positively correlated.}

This study examined the xylene diffusion process in painting workshops as a case study to develop a control of indoor air quality in manufacturing workshops. Three-dimensional simulations of xylene emission were built based on a ventilated chamber test to provide the source term for the mathematical model. An exponential relationship was established between xylene emissions rates and time. Numerical results obtained using the emissions rate model were more consistent with experimental data than those from constant emission rate. Owing to the property that is denser than air; therefore, given the coupled influence of molecular diffusion, gravity and environmental turbulence, the xylene concentration at a height of 0.75–2.5 m is high, and it could possibly exceed the Chinese standard, GBZ 2.1–2019 permissible concentration time weighted average (PC-TWA) of 50 mg/m3 in human-occupied zones. At the height of the human breathing zone (1.1 m), the aggregated concentration may even exceed the PC-TWA at 450 s by 100 times. Considering that the diffusion of xylene in a painting workshop represents heavy-gas pollutant diffusion problems, this study can be extended to predict pollutant concentration distributions in other secondary industrial workshops.}

abstract = {Abstract In-cylinder air motion is one of the most important factors that control the degree of mixture preparation and thus is fundamental to improvements in the combustion process and overall engine performance. The major aim of this paper is to elucidate, through a predictive study, the main features of in-cylinder flow fields in a motored homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine cylinder with variable negative valve overlapping (NVO). A commercial finite-volume computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package was used in the programme of simulation. The computational model was validated through a qualitative comparison between CFD results and the available experimental data. Thus one of the main developments presented in this study is the investigation of the intake process of the HCCI engine with various valve strategies, and it is perhaps the first time (to the current authors’ best knowledge) that a direct comparison has been made of the results obtained in the same HCCI NVO motored engine using modelling and experimental approaches. The comparison illustrated a fair agreement between both sets of results, with some differences. A parametric predictive study of the effects of variable valve timings on the in-cylinder air motion has then been carried out. Three different sets of valve timings have been applied to the intake and exhaust valves to generate NVO of 70, 90, and 110 degrees of crank angle (°CA). The NVO was controlled by adjusting the times of exhaust valves closing (EVC) and intake valves opening (IVO) while keeping the times of exhaust valves opening (EVO) and intake valves closing (IVC) unchanged. The predicted results show a noticeable modification of the strength and the global direction of the in-cylinder charge motion as a result of increasing the magnitude of NVO. Modifications of in-cylinder swirl and tumble motions obtained by applying higher degrees of NVO are expected to have a considerable effect on the air-fuel mixture preparation process as well as the actual in-cylinder conditions at the end of the compression stroke.}

We aimed to investigate and compare the wall shear stress (WSS) and flow dynamics for the branch vessels before and after endovascular aortic repair with fenestrated and chimney techniques. Methods: Modeling was done for patient specific pararenal aortic aneurysms employing fenestrated and chimney grafts (Materialise Mimics 10.0) before and after the endovascular procedure, using computed tomography scans of patients. Surface and spatial grids were created using the ANSYS CFD meshing software 2019 R2. Assessment of blood flow, streamlines, and WSS before and after aneurysm repair was performed. Results: The endovascular repair with chimney grafts leaded to a 43% to 53% reduction in perfusion in renal arteries. In fenestrated reconstruction, we observed a 15% reduced perfusion in both renal arteries. In both cases, we observed a decrease in the recirculation phenomena of the aorta after endovascular repair. Concerning the grafts of the renal arteries, we observed in both the transverse and longitudinal axes low WSS regions with simultaneous recirculation of the flow 1 cm distal to the ostium sites in both aortic graft models. High WSS regions appeared in the sites of ostium. Conclusions: We observed reduced renal perfusion in chimney grafts compared to fenestrated grafts, probably caused by the long and kinked characteristics of these devices.}

abstract = {We investigate metabolic interactions between astrocytes and GABAergic neurons at steady states corresponding to different activity levels using a six-compartment model and a new methodology based on Bayesian statistics. Many questions about the energetics of inhibition are still waiting for definite answers, including the role of glutamine and lactate effluxed by astrocytes as precursors for γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and whether metabolic coupling applies to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Our identification and quantification of metabolic pathways describing the interaction between GABAergic neurons and astrocytes in connection with the release of GABA makes a contribution to this important problem. Lactate released by astrocytes and its neuronal uptake is found to be coupled with neuronal activity, unlike glucose consumption, suggesting that in astrocytes, the metabolism of GABA does not require increased glycolytic activity. Negligible glutamine trafficking between the two cell types at steady state questions glutamine as a precursor of GABA, not excluding glutamine cycling as a transient dynamic phenomenon, or a prominent role of GABA reuptake. Redox balance is proposed as an explanation for elevated oxidative phosphorylation and adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis in astrocytes, decoupled from energy requirements.}

abstract = {Ducted fuel injection (DFI) is an innovative method that curtails or prevents soot formation in direct-injection compression-ignition engines. DFI uses a simple duct, positioned outside each injector hole, facilitating the fuel/charge gas mixing before ignition. This reduces the equivalence ratio below two, in the autoignition zone, which in turn decreases soot formation. But this method also reduces fuel-conversion efficiency. This study investigates the effects of DFI on in-cylinder heat transfer. Experiments with conventional diesel combustion (CDC) and DFI were performed at four different dilution levels. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were carried out at conditions matching those of the experiments, and the simulations were validated by the experimental data. The CFD simulations enabled to examine of in-cylinder heat release and temperature distributions. The heat transfer to the piston, head, and cylinder was investigated. The results show that DFI increased the heat transfer to the walls compared to CDC under the same conditions. This could help explain why DFI has been observed to reduce fuel-conversion efficiency by approximately 1% (absolute) relative to CDC under certain conditions. The efficiency loss typically decreases with dilution, such that DFI can improve fuel-conversion efficiencies relative to CDC at higher dilution levels.}

abstract = {Cathodic protection (CP) is widely used to mitigate corrosion and protect the substrate. However, sacrificial anodes are often undersized or improperly positioned. This study systematically investigates how anode design factors affect the CP effectiveness through computational modelling and double-objective optimisation techniques around the optimum location and dimension of anodes. State-of-the-art algorithms including the Monte-Carlo, Nelder–Mead, co-ordinate search, constrained optimisation by linear approximation (COBYLA) and bound optimisation by quadratic approximation (BOBYQA) are employed to optimise anode locations and genetic algorithm is utilised for optimising anode dimension and the objective is maximising the current output and minimising the cost. In the current study, the BOBYQA technique proved efficient in reaching the optimal response at the appropriate time. The findings indicate that in double-objective (cost and potential) optimisation of 14.5 kg anode, minimising anode radius (from 6.5 cm to 5.4 cm) and optimising the position boosts the current output by up to 15.5%. Refined anode geometries increase the average structure potentials (806 → 822 mV) by over 15 mV, translating to extended service lifetimes. In the comparison of single (cost) and double (cost and potential)-objective optimisation, about 15% more current reaches the structure and causes about 2% less anode mass loss for the same anode dimensions. Also, the results show the 7.7 kg anode performs better than the 14.5 kg anode and so output current and the percentage of current that reaches the structure of the 7.7 kg and 14.5 kg are 0.66 A and 0.46 A and 66% and 60%, respectively.}

abstract = {Wind energy extraction is one of the fastest developing engineering branches today. Number of installed wind turbines is constantly increasing. Appropriate solutions for urban environments are quiet, structurally simple and affordable small-scale vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs). Due to small efficiency, particularly in low and variable winds, main topic here is development of optimal flow concentrator that locally augments wind velocity, facilitates turbine start and increases generated power. Conceptual design was performed by combining finite volume method and artificial intelligence (AI). Smaller set of computational results (velocity profiles induced by existence of different concentrators in flow field) was used for creation, training and validation of several artificial neural networks. Multi-objective optimization of concentrator geometric parameters was realized through coupling of generated neural networks with genetic algorithm. Final solution from the acquired Pareto set is studied in more detail. Resulting computed velocity field is illustrated. Aerodynamic performances of small-scale VAWT with and without optimal flow concentrator are estimated and compared. The performed research demonstrates that, with use of flow concentrator, average increase in wind speed of 20%–25% can be expected. It also proves that contemporary AI techniques can significantly facilitate and accelerate design processes in the field of wind engineering.}

abstract = {Elastohydrodynamic lubrication modelling plays an important role in engineering design and analysis, since a number of important mechanical components operate under elastohydrodynamic lubrication conditions. In this article, methods are presented for solving both line and point contact cases using multiphysics software. The advantages, and the overheads, of using such an approach over developing highly specialised, bespoke software are highlighted. In order to calculate the deformation of the contacts three different methods are developed and their relative performance is assessed. The advantage of using a nested solution strategy has also been examined. The flexibility of the multiphysics software approach is highlighted in results involving a complex transient case modelling an involute gear.}

abstract = {As train speed increases, the aerodynamic noise gradually exceeds the wheel-rail noise and becomes the main noise source of high-speed trains. The aerodynamic noise affects the interior environment of a train in two ways: turbulent wall pressure fluctuation (TWPF) and acoustic wall pressure fluctuation (AWPF). In this paper, a hybrid aerodynamic model for noise analysis of high-speed trains based on the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method and the Lighthill’s acoustic analogy (LAA) algorithm, so-called CFD-LAA method, is established and solved by using the finite-element acoustic simulator of Actran software. The noise contributions of both the TWPF and the AWPF are examined and discussed. The method presented in this paper may be a valuable reference for revealing the generation mechanism of aerodynamic noises and evaluating their effects on a train interior noise.}
