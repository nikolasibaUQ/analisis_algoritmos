abstract = {Emerging artificial intelligence techniques such as genetic algorithms (GAs) allow a more realistic representation and solution of difficult and combinatorial problems such as the dynamic traffic queue management problem. Computational experience in solving such complex large-scale problems by use of micro-GAs is described. In addition to providing evidence of the ability of micro-GAs to successfully identify optimal traffic management schemes, some micro-GA-associated computational issues that warrant attention are highlighted. Choosing a proper population size is a critical decision, and internal variability must be accounted for to assess the goodness of the optimization results properly. A simple rule for deciding the best population size for micro-GAs is proposed. Micro-GAs may converge to low-quality solutions, particularly with very small population sizes; convergence of micro-GAs by itself is not a sufficient indication of good performance. The size of the search space for some real-world systems can pose some difficulties to micro-GAs. Choosing between micro-GAs and regular GAs is a problem-dependent decision.}

abstract = {Abstract This paper presents some results obtained during the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of internal flows inside a hydraulic component, using a scaling technique applied to numerical pre- and post-processing. The main aim of the work is to demonstrate the reduction of computational work needed for a complete analysis of component behaviour over a wide range of operating conditions. This result is achieved through the adoption of a methodology aimed at giving the highest level of generality to a non-dimensional solution, thereby overcoming the two major limitations encountered in the use of CFD in fluid power design: computer resources and time. In the case study, the technique was applied to a hydraulic distributor and computations were performed with a commercial computational fluid dynamics code. The key factor of this technique is the evaluation, for a given distributor opening, of the Reynolds number of the flow in the metering region. Provided that this number is high enough to ensure that the discharge coefficient has reached its asymptotic value, the characterization of the flow by a single non-dimensional numerical run can be shown. The theoretical contents of the analysis of the re-scaling technique, which focuses on the engineering information necessary in component design, are described in detail. The bases for its subsequent application to actual cases are then outlined. Finally, a fairly close correlation between numerical results and experimental data is presented.}

abstract = {Current web-based visualizations are designed for single computers and cannot make use of additional devices on the client side, even if today’s users often have access to several, such as a tablet, a smartphone, and a smartwatch. We present a framework for ad hoc computational clusters that leverage these local devices for visualization computations. Furthermore, we present an instantiating JavaScript toolkit called VisHive for constructing web-based visualization applications that can transparently connect multiple devices—called cells—into such ad hoc clusters—called a hive—for local computation. Hives are formed either using a matchmaking service or through manual configuration. Cells are organized into a master–slave architecture, where the master provides the visual interface to the user and controls the slaves and the slaves perform computation. VisHive is built entirely using current web technologies, runs in the native browser of each cell, and requires no specific software to be downloaded on the involved devices. We demonstrate VisHive using four distributed examples: a text analytics visualization, a database query for exploratory visualization, a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise clustering running on multiple nodes, and a principal component analysis implementation.}

abstract = {People who interact with graphs to perform arithmetic tasks typically employ quantitative features. However, they may employ the spatial metaphor under two alternative conditions: if they have been trained to apply visual arithmetic methods to traditional line and bar graphs, or if they interact with specially constructed and special-purpose computational graphics. Two experiments explored a visual arithmetic method used to train subjects to determine a mean by locating the spatial midpoint of a set of indicators (bars in a bar graph or points in a line graph). In Experiment 1 visual arithmetic subjects determined the mean of five indicators as quickly as they did the mean of two indicators; control subjects performed slower with five indicators. Both groups took more time to add the values of five indicators than to add two indicators. In Experiment 2, unlike control subjects, visual arithmetic subjects’ response times in mean trials were unaffected by changes in the y-axis scale. However, both groups were affected by the y-axis scale on addition trials. Neither group was influenced by changes in the distance between indicators. The discussion addresses the transfer of visual arithmetic training to tasks that differ from the one used during training, uses for visual arithmetic and computational graphics, and the role of parallel processing and task restructuring in visual arithmetic.}

abstract = {Research shows charter schools are more segregated by race and class than are traditional public schools. I investigate an underexamined mechanism for this segregation: Charter schools project identities corresponding to parents’ race- and class-specific parenting styles and educational values. I use computational text analysis to detect the emphasis on inquiry-based learning in the websites of all charter schools operating in 2015–16. I then estimate mixed linear regression models to test the relationships between ideological emphasis and school- and district-level poverty and ethnicity. I thereby transcend methodological problems in scholarship on charter school identities by collecting contemporary, populationwide data and by blending text analysis with hypothesis testing. Findings suggest charter school identities are both race and class specific, outlining a new mechanism by which school choice may consolidate parents by race and class—and paving the way for behavioral and longitudinal studies. This project contributes to literatures on school choice and educational stratification.}

abstract = {Abstract Analysis of metabolic networks typically begins with construction of the stoichiometry matrix, which characterizes the network topology. This matrix provides, via the balance equation, a description of the potential steady-state flow distribution. This paper begins with the observation that the balance equation depends only on the structure of linear redundancies in the network, and so can be stated in a succinct manner, leading to computational efficiencies in steady-state analysis. This alternative description of steady-state behaviour is then used to provide a novel method for network reduction, which complements existing algorithms for describing intracellular networks in terms of input-output macro-reactions (to facilitate bioprocess optimization and control). Finally, it is demonstrated that this novel reduction method can be used to address elementary mode analysis of large networks: the modes supported by a reduced network can capture the input-output modes of a metabolic module with significantly reduced computational effort.}

abstract = {Mixing and combustion of engine combustion network Spray A after end of injection are modeled using highly resolved multidimensional numerical simulations to explore the physics underlying recent experimental observations of combustion recession. Reacting spray simulations are performed using a traditional Lagrangian–Eulerian coupled formulation for two-phase mixture transport with a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes approach using the open-source computational fluid dynamics code OpenFOAM. Chemical kinetics models for n-dodecane by Cai et al. and Yao et al. are deployed to evaluate the impact of mechanism formulation and low-temperature chemistry on predictions of combustion recession behavior. Simulations with the Cai mechanism show that under standard Spray A conditions, the end-of-injection transient induces second-stage ignition in distinct regions near the nozzle that are initially spatially separated from the lifted diffusion flame, but then rapidly merge with flame. By contrast, the Yao mechanism fails to predict sufficient low-temperature chemistry in mixtures upstream of the diffusion flame during the end-of-injection transient and does not predict combustion recession for the same conditions. The effects of the shape and duration of the end-of-injection transient on the entrainment wave near the nozzle, the likelihood of combustion recession, and the spatiotemporal development of mixing and chemistry in near-nozzle mixtures are also investigated. With a more rapid ramp-down injection profile (ramp-down duration < 400 µs), a weaker combustion recession occurs earlier in time after the start of ramp-down. For extremely fast ramp-down (ramp-down duration = 0), the entrainment flux varies rapidly near the nozzle and over-leaning of the mixture completely suppresses combustion recession. For a slower ramp-down profile with respect to the standard Spray A condition, complete combustion recession back toward the nozzle is observed and combustion recession occurred later in time. Simulations qualitatively agreed with the past experimental and modeling observations of combustion recession with different end-of-injection transients.}

abstract = {Background Patellar tendinopathy (jumper’s knee) is characterized by localized tenderness of the patellar tendon at its origin on the inferior pole of the patella and a characteristic increase in signal intensity on magnetic resonance imaging at this location. However, it is unclear why the lesion typically occurs in this area of the patellar tendon as surface strain gauge studies of the patellar tendon through the range of motion have produced conflicting results. Hypothesis The predicted patellar tendon strains that occur as a result of the tendon loads and patella-patellar tendon angles (PPTAs) experienced during a jump landing will be significantly increased in the area of the patellar tendon associated with patellar tendinopathy. Study Design Descriptive laboratory study. Methods A 2-dimensional, computational, finite element model of the patella-patellar tendon complex was developed using anatomic measurements taken from lateral radiographs of a normal knee. The patella was modeled with plane strain rigid elements, and the patellar tendon was modeled with 8-node plane strain elements with neo-Hookean material properties. A tie constraint was used to join the patellar tendon and patella. Patella-patellar tendon angles corresponding to knee flexion angles between 0° and 60° and patellar tendon strains ranging from 5% to 15% were used as input variables into the computational model. To determine if the location of increased strain predicted by the computational model could produce isolated tendon fascicle damage in that same area, 5 human cadaveric patella-patellar tendon-tibia specimens were loaded under conditions predicted by the model to significantly increase localized tendon strain. Pre- and posttesting ultrasound images of the patella–patellar tendon specimens were obtained to document the location of any injured fascicles. Results Localized tendon strain at the classic location of the jumper’s knee lesion was found to increase in association with an increase in the magnitude of applied patellar tendon strain and a decrease in the PPTA. The principal stresses and strains predicted by the model for this localized area were tensile and not compressive in nature. Applying the tendon strain conditions and PPTA predicted by the model to significantly increase localized strain resulted in disruption of tendon fascicles in 3 of the 5 cadaveric specimens at the classic location of the patellar tendinopathy lesion. Conclusion The localized increase in patellar tendon strain that occurs in response to the application of tendon loads and decreased PPTA could induce microdamage at the classic location of the jumper’s knee lesion. Clinical Relevance The association of decreasing PPTA with increasing localized tendon strain would implicate the role of knee-joint angle as well as tendon force in the etiopathogenesis of jumper’s knee.}

abstract = {Individuals with autism spectrum disorder demonstrate narrative (i.e. storytelling) difficulties which can significantly impact their ability to form and maintain social relationships. However, existing research has not comprehensively documented these impairments in more open-ended, emotionally evocative situations common to daily interactions. Computational linguistic measures offer a promising complement to traditional hand-coding methods of narrative analysis and in this study were applied together with hand coding of narratives elicited with emotionally salient scenes from the Thematic Apperception Test. In total, 19 individuals with autism spectrum disorder and 14 typically developing controls were asked to tell stories about six images from the Thematic Apperception Test. Both structural and qualitative aspects of narrative were assessed using a hand-coding system and Latent Semantic Analysis, an automated computational measure of semantic similarity. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder demonstrated significant difficulties with the use of complex syntax to integrate their narratives and problems explaining characters’ intentions. These and other key narrative skills were strongly related to narrative competence scores derived from Latent Semantic Analysis, which also distinguished the autism spectrum disorder group from controls. Together, results underscore key narrative impairments in autism spectrum disorder and support the promise of Latent Semantic Analysis as a valuable tool for the quantitative assessment of complex language abilities.}

The modeling process for calculating the vibration responses of a belt drive system is presented, and two iterative methods are proposed for estimating the tensioner’s nonlinear damping in a varying excitation frequency. One timing belt drive system is taken as a case study. The system’s vibration responses, such as the oscillation angle of tensioner arm, the transmission error between pulleys and the hub load on pulley are calculated and compared with the measured values, which validate the presented methods.

abstract = {In contrast to traditional models of design process fundamentally defined by the abstract manipulation of objects, this study recognizes that the resources available for rethinking architecture are to be found in a reformulation of its theory and practice. This reformation should be based on non-linear design processes in which dynamic emergence and invention take the place of a linear design process fixed on a particular object evolution. Advances in computation thinking and technology have stimulated the design and formulation of a large number of design software. Its elaboration supposes a new conceptualization of our discipline’s knowledge, in a body of principles and regulations, which commands the artifact’s design and its realization; therefore, it constitutes a preliminary datum for its comprehension, and thereby is of theoretical importance. Despite the continuous increment of power in computers and software capacities, the creative space of freedom defined by them acting as cognitive instruments remains almost unexplored. Therefore, we propose a change from a design knowledge based on objects to one focused on design as a network of processes. In addition, this study explores the concept of Distributed Cognition in order to redefine the use of digital tools in design process as Cognitive Instruments.}

Emphasis is laid on the interaction between the mechanical aspects of tribology and the characteristics of the cutting process. Firstly, the fundamentals of the mechanics and physics of cutting processes are outlined. This is extended to friction and lubrication at the tool-workpiece interface and tool wear. On the basis of this quantitative knowledge, the interaction of tribology with a cutting process is demonstrated by means of computer simulation including machinability of free-cutting steels, cutting fluid action and prediction of tool wear. Finally, concluding remarks are devoted to the interaction of tribology with wider aspects of cutting towards the goal of ‘better machining‘.}

The model incorporates a low-level perception/attention module and a higher-level belief-updating module. Attentional scanning is controlled by bottom-up and top-down processes, with the effectiveness of top-down guidance varying as a function of SA. Information sampled by the low-level module is fed forward to the higher-level module for consolidation within a working memory representation of the pilot’s situation, with the quality of this representation reflecting the pilot’s level of SA. The model was validated by comparing its predictions to the behavior of pilots performing a taxiway simulation.

abstract = {This article takes inspiration from Kittler’s claim that philosophy has neglected the means used for its production. Kittler’s argument for media ontology will be compared to the post-Kantian project of re-inventing philosophy through the medium of thought (in particular Deleuze’s Spiritual Automaton). The article discusses these views in the context of the automation of logical thinking where procedures, tasks, and functions are part of the instrumental processing of new ends evolving a new mode of reasoning. In particular, the article suggests that in constructivist logic and information theory, the temporal gap between truth and proof, between input and output, can be taken to argue that the means of thought expose the indetermination or the incomputability of proof. The automation of reasoning in logical processing coincides not with mindless correlations of data, replacing axioms with data, truths with self-validating proofs. Instead, the problem of the indeterminacy of proof within automated logic re-habilitates techne or instrumentality, and the relation between means and ends away from classical idealism and analytic realism. By following John Dewey’s argument for instrumentality, it will be argued that the task of thinking today needs to re-invent a logic of techne away from the teleological view of ends or the crisis of finality. If the post-Kantian preoccupations about the task of thinking already announced that the medium of thought could offer possibilities for a non-human philosophy (or a philosophy beyond truth), this article envisions a machine philosophy originating from within computational media.}

abstract = {How robust is a healthcare system? How does a patient navigate the system and what is the cost (e.g., number of medical services required or number of times the medical provider had to be changed to get access to the required medical services) incurred from the first symptoms to getting cured? How will it fare in the wake to a sudden epidemic or a disaster? How are all of these affected by administrative decisions such as allocating/diminishing resources in various areas or centralising services? These are the questions motivating our study on a formal prototype model for a healthcare system. We propose that a healthcare system can be understood as a distributed system with independent nodes (healthcare providers) computing according to their own resources and constraints, with tasks (patient needs) being allocated between the nodes. The questions about the healthcare system become in this context questions about resource availability and distribution between the nodes. We construct in this paper an Event-B model capturing the basic functionality of a simplified healthcare system: patients with different types of medical needs being allocated to suitable medical providers, and navigating between different providers for their turn for multi-step treatments.}

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the relations of various cognitive abilities and aspects of math performance with computational estimation skill among third graders. Students (n= 315) were assessed on language, nonverbal reasoning, concept formation, processing speed, long–term memory, working memory, inattentive behavior, basic reading skill, arithmetic number combination skill, double–digit computation skill, and computational estimation ability. One–way analysis of variance indicated significant differences in estimation skill among students of low, average, and high math computation performance. The unique predictors of estimation skill were arithmetic number combination skill, nonverbal reasoning, concept formation, working memory, and inattentive behavior.}

abstract = {In a crosswind scenario, the risk of high-speed trains overturning increases when they run on viaducts since the aerodynamic loads are higher than on the ground. In order to increase safety, vehicles are sheltered by fences that are installed on the viaduct to reduce the loads experienced by the train. Windbreaks can be designed to have different heights, and with or without eaves on the top. In this paper, a parametric study with a total of 12 fence designs was carried out using a two-dimensional model of a train standing on a viaduct. To asses the relative effectiveness of sheltering devices, tests were done in a wind tunnel with a scaled model at a Reynolds number of 1 × 105, and the train’s aerodynamic coefficients were measured. Experimental results were compared with those predicted by Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations of flow, showing that a computational model is able to satisfactorily predict the trend of the aerodynamic coefficients. In a second set of tests, the Reynolds number was increased to 12 × 106 (at a free flow air velocity of 30 m/s) in order to simulate strong wind conditions. The aerodynamic coefficients showed a similar trend for both Reynolds numbers; however, their numerical value changed enough to indicate that simulations at the lower Reynolds number do not provide all required information. Furthermore, the variation of coefficients in the simulations allowed an explanation of how fences modified the flow around the vehicle to be proposed. This made it clear why increasing fence height reduced all the coefficients but adding an eave had an effect mainly on the lift force coefficient. Finally, by analysing the time signals it was possible to clarify the influence of the Reynolds number on the peak-to-peak amplitude, the time period and the Strouhal number.}
