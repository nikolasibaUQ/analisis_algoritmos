abstract = {Media convergence is not a new concept in journalism studies, though available evidence indicates that convergence studies have been explored more in the global north than the global south. This study, contextualised in Nigeria, joins the media convergence conversation by exploring the sustainability of Facebook-radio convergence for distributing broadcast programmes by seventeen (17) licenced radio stations in Oyo State, Nigeria. As a computational content analysis study, researchers analysed 85 purposively selected programmes of the stations as broadcast live on their Facebook pages alongside the 9527 likes, 10,314 shares, 7007 comments and 170,681 views the programmes generated. Stakeholders’ interviews were also conducted for a broadcasting expert, presenters of some of the stations, together with audience of the selected stations. The main finding shows that programmes that focussed more on socioeconomic problems and opportunities, and were broadcast in the afternoon, evening and at night received more digital engagement than other programmes’ formats and time belts. Although high cost of Internet data subscription in the country, absence of Internet-enabled mobile phones among many adherents of radio programmes (both in rural and urban areas), epileptic power supply that sometimes leave many people with unpowered mobile phones as well as weak Internet broadband connectivity common to many locations in Nigeria threaten the sustainability of Facebook-radio broadcasting in Oyo State. Deployment of 5G network, installation of more network masts with strong bandwidth and training of radio presenters and radio stations’ social media handlers on innovative and audience-participatory programme production are recommended.}

Two different methods for capturing the free interface movement are applied, namely the volume-of-fluid method and the level-set method. Both methods are very popular and available within commercial computational fluid dynamics tools. The wave is initialized using two different perturbations implemented into the model. As a case study, a system comprising a toluene layer and an aqueous layer is chosen. Numerical results obtained by both methods are in a good agreement with the linear stability theory for small wave amplitudes. The application of both methods is compared and their advantages and drawbacks are highlighted.}

abstract = {Abstract A number of modelling approaches, such as enterprise modelling, simulation modelling, and causal loop diagramming, have been used independently for designing systems of different kinds, such as machine systems, social systems, and production systems. Enterprise modelling has its roots in control system design. Simulation modelling has generally been used in re-engineering and optimizing production and service processes, whereas causal loop diagramming (systems thinking) has generally been used for systems designing in management and social sciences. This paper describes the combined use of these three modelling approaches which carry complementary concepts that can be used together for supporting management decisions in designing and changing complex manufacturing enterprises. A decision support framework is presented that is instrumented with combined use of these three modelling approaches and has been tested in production management-related decision making.}

The courses differed according to the characteristics of the tasks that were used. The first course involved ‘pure mathematical guided investigations’ emphasizing scaffolding steps in pure mathematics contexts. The second course focused on ‘applied open explorations’ underlining more open questions in applied everyday contexts. The courses were compared in respect to students’ learning outcomes. The findings, yielded from the analysis of pre-test and post-test data, indicated that the second course had better learning outcomes compared to the first.}

abstract = {The mixture formation and combustion process of a hydrogen direct-injection internal combustion engine is computed using a modified version of a commercial three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics code. The aim of the work is the evaluation of hydrogen laminar flame speed correlations and turbulent flame speed closures with respect to combustion of premixed and stratified mixtures at various levels of air-to-fuel equivalence ratio. Heat-release rates derived from in-cylinder pressure traces are used for the validation of the combustion simulations. A turbulent combustion model with closures for a turbulent flame speed is investigated. The value of the computed heat-release rates mainly depends on the quality of laminar burning velocities and standard of turbulence quantities provided to the combustion model. Combustion simulations performed with experimentally derived laminar flame speed data give better results than those using laminar flame speeds obtained from a kinetic scheme. However, experimental data of hydrogen laminar flame speeds found in the literature are limited regarding the range of pressures, temperatures and air-to-fuel equivalence ratios, and do not comply with the demand of high-pressure engine-relevant conditions.}

abstract = {A micromechanical model was established based on the fluid dynamics theory. This model could be used to calculate several kinds of data when the asphalt pavement under the influence of traffic loading is in water-saturated condition. The results showed that the maximum pressure inside the effective pore was located at the junction between exit slits and the pore wall. There was a positive correlation between the pressure and the vehicle speed. Therefore, the repeated traffic loading could cause emulsification, shift and even peeling of the asphalt membrane. Moreover, the bigger size of the exit slit is, the higher velocity of the fluid has. The high velocity flow keeps scouring both the exit slit and the lower boundary of pore wall. It will cause a bigger slit. Pressure distribution inside the effective pore is related to the number of the exit slit which connect with the pore. More exit slits means bigger pressure inside the effective pore. In addition, if asphalt membranes at exit slits have micro-cracking, the cumulative damage could appear easily and asphalt membranes could be peeled easily. Finally, a test was conducted so as to obtain the bonding strength and adhesion strength between asphalt and aggregate. Then, we can get accurate damage form and position during the scour process by comparing the numerical simulation results with experiment results.}

abstract = {Interstitial photodynamic therapy has shown promising results in the treatment of locally advanced head and neck cancer. In this therapy, systemic administration of a light-sensitive drug is followed by insertion of multiple laser fibers to illuminate the tumor and its margins. Image-based pretreatment planning is employed in order to deliver a sufficient light dose to the complex locally advanced head-and-neck cancer anatomy, in order to meet clinical requirements. Unfortunately, the tumor may deform between pretreatment imaging for the purpose of planning and intraoperative imaging when the plan is executed. Tumor deformation may result from the mechanical forces applied by the light fibers and variation of the patient’s posture. Pretreatment planning is frequently done with the assistance of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging in an outpatient suite, while treatment monitoring and control typically uses ultrasound imaging due to considerations of costs and availability in the operation room. This article presents a computational method designed to bridge the gap between the 2 imaging events by taking a tumor geometry, reconstructed during preplanning, and by following the displacement of fiducial markers, which are initially placed during the preplanning procedure. The deformed tumor shape is predicted by solving an inverse problem, seeking for the forces that would have resulted in the corresponding fiducial marker displacements. The computational method is studied on spheres of variable sizes and demonstrated on computed tomography reconstructed locally advanced head and neck cancer model. Results of this study demonstrate an average error of less than 1 mm in predicting the deformed tumor shape, where 1 mm is typically the order of uncertainty in distance measurements using magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography imaging and high-quality ultrasound imaging. This study further demonstrates that the deformed shape can be calculated in a few seconds, making the proposed method clinically relevant.}

abstract = {One of the major limitations of reactivity controlled compression ignition is higher unburned hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions and lower thermal efficiency at part load operating conditions. In the present study, a combined numerical approach using a commercial three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics code CONVERGE along with artificial neural network and genetic algorithm is presented to address the above limitation. A production light-duty diesel engine is modified to run in reactivity controlled compression ignition by replacing an existing mechanical fuel injection system with a flexible electronic port fuel injection and common rail direct injection systems. The injection schedules of port fuel injection and direct injection injectors are controlled using National Instruments port and direct injection driver modules. Upon validation of combustion and emission parameters, parametric investigations are carried out to establish the effects of direct-injected diesel fuel timing start of injection (SOI), premixed fuel ratio and intake charge temperature on the engine performance and emissions in reactivity controlled compression ignition. The results obtained show that the start of injection timing and intake charge temperature significantly influence combustion phasing, while the premixed fuel ratio controls mixture reactivity and combustion quality. By utilizing the data generated with the validated computational fluid dynamics models, the artificial neural network models are trained to predict the engine exhaust emissions and efficiency. The artificial neural network models for gross indicated efficiency and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) are then coupled with genetic algorithm to maximize gross indicated efficiency while keeping the NOx and soot emissions within Euro VI emission limits. By optimizing the start of injection timing, premixed fuel ratio and intake charge temperature simultaneously using the artificial neural network models coupled with genetic algorithm, 19% improvement in gross indicated efficiency, 60% and 64% reduction in hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions, respectively, are obtained in reactivity controlled compression ignition compared to the baseline case.}

abstract = {The wind flow field constitutes an important input parameter for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations that are used in architectural design for the design and analysis of natural ventilation strategies.  Despite indications that the wind flow field may vary between places, CFD simulations that do not adequately account for this potential variation are still commonplace. This may significantly compromise the integrity and accuracy of the CFD simulations. This study was a two-pronged investigation with the ultimate objective of contributing towards efforts aimed at improving the accuracy of the CFD simulations. Firstly, a framework for integrated meso-scale and micro-scale CFD simulations was developed. Secondly, the newly developed framework was then implemented by deploying it to study the variation of the wind flow field between a reference meteorological station, and a selected local building site. The findings confirmed the indications that the wind flow field might vary spatially. The integrated multi-scale framework that was developed as part of the study was not only able to capture the wind flow field variation, but it also provided a way to quantify it, ultimately, leading to the generation of a more accurate wind flow field characterization representative of the local conditions. Through its ability to integrate multiple spatial scales that typically influence one another, this framework can help to enhance the accuracy and integrity of the CFD simulations that are used for natural ventilation design. Practical application: The findings from this study can be particularly useful when undertaking spatially integrated CFD simulations to design and analyse natural ventilation strategies in the building design process.}

Because of the small number of cases under study, these researchers must rely either explicitly or implicitly on counterfactual reasoning. This paper argues that computational methods provide a profitable means of carrying out rigorous counterfactual analysis. The authors advocate robustness analysis as one important part of the counterfactual analysis of formal theories. Specifically, they evaluate the robustness of the behavioral assumptions of two formal models using various heuristic search algorithms and Markov chains. They find that Kuran’s (1989) threshold model of mass protest and Ingberman’s (1985) model of direct-democracy referenda are robust to perturbations in their behavioral assumptions. These findings increase the plausibility of causal claims made by scholars who use these models to explain specific events.}

abstract = {Fire is a critical risk in reinforced concrete (RC) structures and appropriate structural resistance against it has to be ensured. In this contribution, an approach using corotational layered beam finite elements is employed in which the cross-section temperature is derived from a low-cost closed form model, as opposed to the more commonly used fully computational thermal analysis. The effect of geometrical and material nonlinearities (constitutive behavior fitted to experimental data for concrete and steel), material degradation as a function of temperature rise, and the contributions of thermal, transient, and creep strains are incorporated in the structural analysis. The computational results are favorably compared to experimental data from the literature for an RC beam and for a larger RC frame. Taking benefit of the layered beam formulation offering local insight into the cross-sectional and material behavior, the relationship between the structural degradation and data extracted from the cross-sectional behavior is successfully established. Noteworthy originalities of the contribution are the use of ultimate strain and its evolution as a function of temperature for both materials and the explanation of the observed structural response in fire conditions from cross-sectional data.}

abstract = {This workshop addressed current issues with regard to establishing a framework for the validation of quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSARs) and other computational prediction models. QSARs and related models attempt to associate physicochemical and structural properties of compounds to their biological activity. As such, they may permit the prediction of biological activity from chemical structure alone. As yet, no formal validation criteria have been agreed internationally for QSARs and related techniques. However, some general and preliminary criteria were discussed and agreed upon at a European Chemical Industry Council/International Council of Chemical Associations (CEFIC/ICCA) workshop on the regulatory acceptance of QSARs, held in Setubal, Portugal, in March 2002. These criteria were presented at a Fourth World Congress workshop, along with a proposal for the practical validation of computer models, such as QSARs.}

abstract = {In this article, a novel tray humidifier column for humidification dehumidification desalination was proposed. The performance of the humidifier column has been investigated with experimental and computational fluid dynamics simulations. The hydrodynamics and heat transfer characteristics of this tray humidifier has been studied. A stainless steel sieve tray with a rectangular cross section with a dimension of 20 × 50 cm was used in the experimental study. In computational fluid dynamics modeling, a transient three-dimensional model has been developed based on the volume of fluid framework by using standard k-epsilon model. The effect of air and seawater flow rate and inlet seawater temperature on the exit air temperature has been investigated. The results show that the humidifier effectiveness of the tray humidifier column varies between 0.67 and 0.87 depending on operating conditions. Then, tray column can be used in humidification dehumidification desalination systems with advantages such as compact equipment, low-pressure drop, and handling solids or other sources of fouling.}

abstract = {Relatively little attention has been paid to the venous system and valves from a cardiovascular engineering perspective up to now. Given the involvement of venous valve haemodynamics in the development of deep vein thrombosis this is an area that needs more detailed investigation and close collaboration between clinicians and cardiovascular engineers. The purpose of this review article is to provide an indication of the physiological conditions that need to be included in any computational model of the venous system, based on recommendations from clinicians, and to summarize published computational models of the venous system by trying to explore their limitations and application range. A MEDLINE search was carried out on the relevant literature from 1940 until today. Several models have been developed with a specific purpose in mind to coincide with the aim of each individual study. The model complexity and laws used in each model vary significantly. There are more simplistic computational models based on electric circuit analogies, termed as lumped parameter models, which can be used to provide boundary conditions to one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) domain models, followed by 1D continuous models based on analytical equations, which allow the description of pressure wave and can be non-linear in nature. Finally, there are the more advanced 3D models, which are based on the principles of haemodynamics, and consider the compliance of the venous system and the effect that venous valves have on the cardiovascular system. In conclusion, it appears that computer modelling of the venous system can contribute greatly to our understanding of venous physiology and allow us to evaluate the haemodynamic interactions that occur in the venous system under different physiological conditions.}
