abstract = {Computational design affords agency: the ability to orchestrate the material, spatial, and technical architectural system. In this specific case, it occurs through enhanced, authored means to facilitate making and performance—typically driven by concerns of structural optimization, material use, and responsivity to environmental factors—of an atmospheric rather than social nature. At issue is the positioning of this particular manner of agency solely with the architect auteur. This abruptly halts—at the moment in which fabrication commences—the ability to amend, redefine, or newly introduce fundamentally transformational constituents and their interrelationships and, most importantly, to explore the possibility for extraordinary outcomes. When the architecture becomes a functional, social, and cultural entity, in the hands of the idealized abled-bodied user, agency—especially for one of an otherly body or mind—is long gone. Even an empathetic auteur may not be able to access the motivations of the differently-abled body and neuro-divergent mind, effectively locking the constraints of the design process, which creates an exclusionary system to those beyond the purview of said auteur. It can therefore be deduced that the mechanisms or authors of a conventional computational design process cannot eradicate the exclusionary reality of an architectural system. Agency is critical, yet a more expansive terminology for agent and agency is needed. The burden to conceive of capacities that will always be highly temporal, social, unpredictable, and purposefully unknown must be shifted far from the scope of the traditional directors of the architectural system. Agency, and who it is conferred upon, must function in a manner that dissolves the distinctions between the design, the action of designing, the author of design, and those subjected to it.}

abstract = {Predictive modeling of pre-chamber combustion engines relies primarily on the correct description of laminar and turbulent flame speeds. For engineering applications, the correlations of the flame speeds with physical variables involve empirical constants that are valid for a limited range of operating conditions. The current work aims at assessing the significance of laminar flame speed prediction in the simulation of ultra-lean pre-chamber engine combustion operated with methane. Gülder’s empirical correlation for laminar flame speed was chosen as a reference and was further modified for equivalence ratio, pressure and temperature ranges beyond what it was originally derived for, in order to confirm the original hypothesis; the pressure and temperature dependence were adopted as a power-law correlation. Based on the computational results using the skeletal reaction mechanism, the correlation was modified better represent the flame speeds at ultra-lean engine conditions, using GRI 3.0 as a reference. The modified correlation for methane was implemented in CONVERGE, a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver, and the results were validated against the experimental data. In all cases, the original formulation of Peters’s turbulent flame speed correlation was used and was found to have insignificant effect on the conditions under study, confirming the importance of the accurate determination of the laminar flame speed that dominates over any turbulence corrections for high Karlovitz number effects. The flame topology was also investigated to provide insights into the observed pressure behavior among the tested cases. Finally, the relevant turbulent combustion regimes encountered in the pre-chamber combustion engine conditions were examined in the Borghi-Peters diagram, further confirming the findings of the study.}

This work was conceived as a balance between modeling the complex phenomena within the human visual system and the need for a simple applications-oriented tool for practitioners to derive a quantitative relative assessment of real-world construction work zones to rank choices in terms of conspicuity. The results indicate that the vision model–based tool can assess the relative conspicuity of individual elements of a roadway or roadside scene and is relatively straightforward in use. As such, it holds potential value in virtual prototyping of work-zone sight lines, colors, and placement of hazard warning cues, such as cones, markings, and reflective vests.}

abstract = {All operations in process metallurgy involve complex phenomena comprising momentum, heat, and/or mass transport; iron- and steelmaking is not an exception. Transport phenomena, i.e. fluid flows, heat transfer and mass transfer, play a dominant role in process metallurgy since their respective laws govern the kinetics of the various physical phenomena occurring in ironmaking and in steelmaking. These phenomena include such events as three-phase reactions, entrainment of slag and gas in liquid steel, vacuum degassing, alloy melting and mixing, the movements and flotation of inclusions, melt temperature losses, residence times in a metallurgical reactor, erosion of refractory linings, etc. In all these aspects, the evolution in our techniques and abilities to model single and multiphase flows and their attendant heat and mass transfer processes has contributed significantly to our understanding and effectively operating these processes, to designing improvements, and to developing new processes. To be ignorant of these matters can doom a processing operation to the scrap heap of metallurgical failures. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and computational heat and mass transfer has been a very effective tool over the last three decades, for modelling iron- and steelmaking processes, starting from the blast furnace up to continuous casting and beyond. With the advent of commercial CFD packages and ever increasing computational power through parallel processing, CFD has now become the dominant approach for predicting various aspects in iron- and steelmaking processes. In Part 1 of this review paper, the applications of CFD in ironmaking processes are thoroughly reviewed, discussed and critiqued. In Part 2, fluid flows and CFD in steelmaking and steel casting processes are similarly reviewed and critiqued.}

abstract = {This study presents a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to simulate the three-dimensional airflow in the trachea before and after the vascular ring surgery (VRS). The simulation was based on CT-scan images of the patients with the vascular ring diseases. The surface geometry of the tracheal airway was reconstructed using triangular mesh by the Amira software package. The unstructured tetrahedral volume meshes were generated by the ANSYS ICEM CFD software package. The airflow in the tracheal airway was solved by the ESI CFD-ACE+ software package. Numerical simulation shows that the pressure drops across the tracheal stenosis before and after the surgery were 0.1789 and 0.0967 Pa, respectively, with the inspiratory inlet velocity 0.1 m/s. Meanwhile, the improvement percentage by the surgery was 45.95%. In the expiratory phase, by contrast, the improvement percentage was 40.65%. When the inspiratory velocity reached 1 m/s, the pressure drop became 4.988~Pa and the improvement percentage was 43.32%. Simulation results further show that after treatment the pressure drop in the tracheal airway was significantly decreased, especially for low inspiratory and expiratory velocities. The CFD method can be applied to quantify the airway pressure alteration and to evaluate the treatment outcome of the vascular ring surgery under different respiratory velocities.}

abstract = {Bifacial photovoltaic cells can produce electricity from incoming solar radiation on both sides. These cells have a strong potential to reduce electricity generation costs and may play an important role in the energy system of the future. However, today, these cells are mostly deployed with one side receiving only ground reflection, which leads to a profound sub-optimal utilization of one of the sides of the bifacial cells. Concentration allows a better usage of the potential of bifacial cells, which can lead to a lower cost per kWh. However, concentration also adds complexity due to the higher temperatures reached which add the requirement of cooling in order to achieve higher outputs. This way, this paper focuses on the effectiveness of forced air circulation methods by comparing the thermal performance of three specific concentrating bi-facial collector designs. This paper developed a computational model, using ANSYS Fluent intending to assess the thermal performance of a covered concentrating collector with bifacial Photovoltaic (PV) cells. These results have then been validated by outdoor measurements. Results show that even a simple natural ventilation mechanism such as removing the side gable can effectively reduce the receiver temperature, thus resulting in favourable cell operation conditions when compared to the case of an airtight collector. Therefore, compared with a standard model, a decrease of 13.5% on the cell operating temperature was reported when the side gables are removed. However, when forced ventilation is apllied a 22.8% reduction on temperature is found compared to the standard air-tight model. The validated CFD model has proven to be a useful and robust tool for the thermal analysis of solar concentrating systems.}

Considering stability and economy, an optimal layout scheme is selected from four candidates by simulation using computational fluid dynamics method. Trials were carried out in Danjiangkou Reservoir—important headwaters of the Middle Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. In the trials, a monitoring strategy with polygonal mixed-motion was adopted to make full use of the advantages of the unmanned platform. The measuring data, including temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH, turbidity, chlorophyll, and ammonia nitrogen, are obtained. These data validate the practicability of the theoretical layout obtained using computational fluid dynamics method and the practical performance of PETRELII with sensor.}

abstract = {We investigate a new approach for characterizing class separability based on topological measures for use with identifying flaw severity in plates. Multi-mode Lamb waves are propagated across a flat-bottom hole of varying depth. Lamb wave tomography reconstructions are first generated to locate and size the flaw at each depth. As the flaw depth increases, scattering and mode conversion effects dominate the raw time-domain signals, obscuring information about flaw severity. Pattern classification provides an alternate means for processing the ultrasonic waveforms to identify flaw severity. High-dimensional feature spaces are generated from the Lamb wave signals using the dynamic wavelet fingerprinting technique. In order to achieve high classification accuracy, an optimal feature space is required. An intelligent feature selection routine is explored here that identifies favorable class distributions in multidimensional feature spaces using computational homology theory. Betti numbers and formal classification accuracies are calculated for each feature space subset to establish a correlation between the topology of the class distribution and the corresponding classification accuracy.}

abstract = {Present day computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations generate considerable amounts of data, sometimes on the order of TB/s. Often, a significant fraction of this data is discarded because current storage systems are unable to keep pace. To address this, data compression algorithms can be applied to data arrays containing flow quantities of interest (QoIs) to reduce the overall required storage. The matrix column interpolative decomposition (ID) can be implemented as a type of lossy compression for data matrices that factors the original data matrix into a product of two smaller factor matrices. One of these matrices consists of a subset of the columns of the original data matrix, while the other is a coefficient matrix which approximates the original data matrix columns as linear combinations of the selected columns. Motivating this work is the observation that the structure of ID algorithms makes them well suited for the asynchronous nature of task-based parallelism; they can operate independently on subdomains of the system of interest and, as a result, provide varied levels of compression. Using the task-based Legion programming model, a single-pass ID algorithm (SPID) for CFD applications is implemented. Performance studies, scalability, and the accuracy of the compression algorithm are presented for a benchmark analytical Taylor-Green vortex problem, as well as large-scale implementations of both low and high Reynolds number (Re) compressible Taylor-Green vortices using a high-order Navier-Stokes solver. In the case of the analytical solution, the resulting compressed solution was rank-one, with error on the order of machine precision. For the low-Re vortex, compression factors between 1000 and 10,000 were achieved for errors in the range 10−2–10−3. Similar error values were seen for the high-Re vortex, this time with compression factors between 100 and 1000. Moreover, strong and weak scaling results demonstrate that introducing SPID to solvers leads to negligible increases in runtime.}

abstract = {In this paper, two alternative numerical approaches for the simulation of Gerotor units are compared: a fast lumped parameter approach for the fluid dynamics through the unit that permits the co-simulation of the radial micro-motion of the rotors, and a computational fluid dynamics approach that puts emphasis on the description of the detailed features of the flow through the unit. Each approach provides unique insights on the unit operation, although with different assumptions and level of result details. For an objective comparison of these two state-of-art models, the authors compared their results with experiments. A commercial pump taken as reference, and tests focused on steady-state volumetric performance as well as the transient features of the outlet port pressure oscillations. The results presented in the paper permit to gain a high level of understanding of the operation of the unit and of the critical aspects that a designer should consider while analyzing such design of positive displacement machines. While comparing the two simulation approaches, the paper highlights the limits and the strengths of each one of the two approaches. In particular, it is shown how both models can match the experimental results considering proper assumptions, in terms of technological clearances and rotors’ micro-motions. The paper constitutes a unique contribution in the field of numerical simulation of Gerotor units and represents a useful reference to the designers looking for suitable methods for simulating existing or novel design solutions.}

Despite the increasing success, clinical studies have reported stent failure after the deployment in the human body, thus undermining patient’s safety and life. This study aims to fill the gap of reliable assessment of the fatigue life of Nitinol stents. We propose a global computational design method for preclinical validation of Nitinol stents, which can be extended to patient-specific computations. The proposed methodology is composed of a mechanical finite element analysis and a fatigue analysis. The latter analysis is based on a novel multiaxial fatigue criterion of the Dang Van type, combining the shakedown response of the stent and the complexity of phase transformation taking place within the material. The method is implemented in the case of a carotid artery stent. The implant configuration as well as the applied cyclic loading are shown to affect material phase evolution as well as stent lifetime. The comparison with the results obtained by applying a strain-based constant-life diagram approach allows to critically discuss both fatigue criteria and to provide useful recommendations about their applicability.}

CFD is capable of providing a detailed analysis of airflow profile and temperature gradients in the space as well as better prediction of heat transfer involving convection and radiation. Whereas BES can provide dynamically changing boundary conditions to CFD to facilitate a precise transient analysis. Combining the two simulations provides a powerful framework to accurately predict building performance parameters. The review examines the variables exchanged between the two simulations and establishes that the Convective Heat Transfer Coefficient (CHTC) as the most important exchanged variable that can significantly improve the accuracy of energy simulations. Issues regarding the application of co-simulation mechanism are then discussed in terms of simulation discontinuities, along with strategies adopted by researchers to overcome the same. In the later sections, the review evaluates the applicability of co-simulation from the perspective of year-long building energy simulations and presents an overview of methods used in research to implement the same. Finally, the conclusions are discussed and the scope for future research in the field is presented. Practical implication: The review presents a critical analysis of essentially all major coupling strategies that can be used to perform a BES-CFD coupled analysis along with their strengths, limitations and possible application scenarios. Additionally, the problems associated with establishing the co-simulation are examined and various adopted solutions are presented along with methods implemented towards extending the practical applicability of such an analysis to encapsulate year-long simulations.}

abstract = {Any hydraulic reaction turbine is installed with a draft tube that impacts widely the entire turbine performance, on which its functions are as follows: drive the flux in appropriate manner after it releases its energy to the runner; recover the suction head by a suction effect; and improve the dynamic energy in the runner outlet. All these functions are strongly linked to the geometric definition of the draft tube. This article proposes a geometric parametrization and analysis of a Francis turbine draft tube. Based on the parametric definition, geometric changes in the draft tube are proposed and the turbine performance is modeled by computational fluid dynamics; the boundary conditions are set by measurements performed in a hydroelectric power plant. This modeling allows us to see the influence of the draft tube shape on the entire turbine performance. The numerical analysis is based on the steady-state solution of the turbine component flows for different guide vanes opening and multiple modified draft tubes. The computational fluid dynamics predictions are validated using hydroelectric plant measurements. The prediction of the turbine performance is successful and it is linked to the draft tube geometric features; therefore, it is possible to obtain a draft tube parameter value that results in a desired turbine performance.}

The model predicted very satisfactorily the composition of both the ferrovanadium and waste slag from a heat at the Windimurra smelter in Western Australia. Moreover, the modelling revealed that published data on the activity coefficient of VO1.5 in slag were likely to be seriously in error. It was shown that increasing the recovery of vanadium to the ferroalloy was accompanied by a rapid increase in its aluminium content, which is limited by commercial specifications. The limit on the silicon content of ferrovanadium can only be met by limiting the input of SiO2 to the furnace. The model provides a useful basis for assessing process improvements.}

abstract = {Most manganese used in the world is consumed as ferroalloys by the steelmaking industry. Submerged arc electric furnace smelting using the manganese-rich slag method is widely used to produce ferromanganese. This process has been modelled using the HSC computational thermodynamics package. It was assumed that higher manganese and iron oxides are reduced to MnO and FeO before entering the zone where molten slag and alloy form and equilibrate. The model predictions were compared to data from Thermit Alloys (P) Limited, an Indian ferroalloy smelter, and the agreement was found to be good. It was then used to examine the affects of changing the amount of carbon reductant and temperature on several performance indicators. The results of this modelling are discussed and it is concluded that the model is useful as an aid to understanding ferromanganese smelting.}

abstract = {The aim of this study was to describe and compare perceptions of critical thinking, attitudes to and availability of research, research utilization and barriers to this among nursing students in Scandinavia and Indonesia. Data were collected at the beginning, middle and end of education from nursing students in Norway, Sweden (bachelor’s diploma) and Banda Aceh (bachelor’s diploma). Critical Thinking and Research Utilization Questionnaires were used along with the Barrier Scale. Descriptive analyses, comparisons between and within groups were performed. At the end of education, all samples exhibited positive attitudes to research and the main barrier was related to the setting. Scandinavian students reported higher critical thinking. Indonesian students perceived greater barriers on two Barrier subscales. No differences were found between the samples regarding research utilization. Significant changes over time varied among the samples except for the Norwegian sample. Indonesian students (diploma) exhibited most changes over time. Teachers must support nursing students to strengthen their critical thinking ability and develop professional competence.}

abstract = {Based on the open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) platform, OpenFOAM, two numerical simulation methods for gusty inflow characterization and gust response prediction are implemented by solving the fundamental incompressible unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (URANS) equations. One is the Field Velocity Method (FVM) and the other is the Oscillating Vane Method (OVM). The gust velocity field is characterized and the aerodynamic responses of some airfoils under the Sears-type sinusoidal gusts are predicted by both gust simulation methods. The results indicate that both methods are capable of obtaining satisfactory gusty inflow conditions as expected as well as the airfoil aerodynamic responses. Comparatively, from the perspective of computing cost, the FVM is more advantageous in reducing the computational resources than the OVM while simultaneously ensuring the computational accuracy.}

abstract = {Many countries and regions have reached a consensus to promote science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education in the past decade. A body of studies have demonstrated that the design and organization of interdisciplinary teaching activities are important for the effective implementation of STEM education. So far, however, little attention has been paid to the taxonomy of teaching models in STEM education. This paper aims to propose a taxonomy based on the dimensions of learning outcomes (i.e., product-oriented and knowledge-oriented) and teaching process (i.e., forward teaching model and reverse teaching model) in STEM education. Through the intersection of the above two dimensions, four teaching models in STEM education have emerged, including project-based learning (PBL), reverse engineering (RE), scientific inquiry (SI), and troubleshooting/debugging (T/D). In addition, four cases are introduced to explain how these four teaching models operate in STEM education. The implications of this work for future research are also discussed. It is promising that the study will be valuable to enrich the current research, and shed light on the theory and practice of STEM education.}
