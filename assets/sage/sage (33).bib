abstract = {Reversible phosphorylation maintained by protein kinases and phosphatases is an integral part of intracellular signalling, and phosphorylation on tyrosine is extensively utilised in higher eukaryotes. Tyrosine phosphatases are enzymes that not only scavenge phosphotyrosine but are also involved in wide range of signalling pathways. As a result, mutations in these enzymes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases like cancer, autoimmune disorders, and muscle-related diseases. The genes that harbour phosphatase domain also display diversity in co-existing domains suggesting the recruitment of the catalytic machinery in diverse pathways. We have examined the current draft of the human genome, using a combination of 3 sequence search methods and validations, and identified 101 genes encoding tyrosine phosphatase-containing gene products, agreeing with previous reports. Such gene products adopt 37 unique domain architectures (DAs), including few new ones and harbouring few co-existing domains that have not been reported before. This semi-automated computational approach for detection of gene products belonging to a particular superfamily can now be easily applied at whole genome level on other mammalian genomes and for other protein domains as well.}

abstract = {Background According to the Committee on STEM Education, K-12 science students need access to learning experiences that promote collaboration and engagement. To fill that void, we need to develop activities that stimulate engaged learning and scaffold effective collaboration. K-12 teacher candidates see value in utilizing games for this purpose. Specifically, tabletop science games can help teachers engage students in science learning and scaffold collaboration. Aim For this study, we designed a collaborative, STEM-themed card game called MOUNTAIN RESCUE and explored its capacity to promote engaged learning and collaboration. Method Four groups of STEM campers (n = 14) in a suburban Mid-Atlantic region played MOUNTAIN RESCUE. All groups had a mix of boys and girls. Play-testers ranged from 10–13 years old. The tabletop game took approximately 30-minutes. During gameplay, players embodied unique STEM roles: physicist, chemist, structural engineer, and electrical engineer. They collaborated to solve challenges related to electricity, physics, chemistry, and engineering design. Discourse was audio-recorded throughout gameplay. Immediately after gameplay, self-report survey data were collected to assess flow and perceptions of collaborative learning. Results Findings demonstrated that the game promoted engagement and collaboration. Specifically, students had a flow-like experience and felt positively about the game’s value for collaborative learning. Utterances demonstrating active engagement and constructive thinking became more group-focused over time. Conclusion This study contributes to science education by demonstrating potential benefits of a well-designed, low-tech, science learning environment or—in other words—a tabletop game.}

abstract = {Abstract A computational investigation of the interaction of the vectored primary jet from the main engine with the subsonic flow around a tailless unmanned air vehicle (UAV) configuration, with a cropped diamond wing planform, has been carried out. An initial study has been completed using Reynolds-averaged Navier—Stokes methods in conjunction with the shear-stress transport k—ω model. Various sets of simulations were performed on the basis of quantifying the thrust vectoring (TV) jet entrainment effects by means of aerodynamic forces and moments when key factors are combined, such as angles of thrust velocity deflection at different jet Mach number and angles of attack. It was found that reaction forces induced by the modified pressure on the integrated boundary of the body results in an enhancement of the TV effectiveness in producing the forces and moments required for the flight vehicle trim and manoeuvring. Those reaction forces were found to be independent of the angle of attack.}

From this investigation, it has emerged that even if for all the kinds of power losses improvements are in principle possible, those for which, at the same time, more improvements seem possible and effective models are lacking are the load-independent power losses. For this reason, a computational fluid dynamics methodology able to evaluate load-independent gear power losses in planetary gearboxes is proposed. The other types of power losses were determined by means of analytical models available in the literature and, together with the calculated load-independent gear power losses, compared with the experimentally determined power losses showing the effectiveness of the adopted calculation models.}

abstract = {With the release of the Next Generation Science Standards and the adoption of the standards by many states, teachers are encouraged to use the engineering design process (EDP) as an instructional approach to teaching science. However, teachers have limited time to teach science and will often neglect science in favor of mathematics and literacy instruction. To make this feasible for elementary classrooms, teachers should be encouraged to implement integrated units of study utilizing EDP to cohesively bind content areas and to increase active learning, critical thinking, and problem solving among all learners. An additional benefit of using EDP as an instructional strategy is the focus on problem solving and the avoidance of one size fits all learning. Students actively engage in learning content (science, mathematics, literacy, social studies) as they collaboratively work together to solve societal and environmental problems. Knowledge is built as students progress through the challenges and content is provided on a need to know basis, thereby differentiating instruction based on learner needs and challenging gifted learners. In this article, the author provides four sample engineering challenges that can be used to create an integrated unit of study using the EDP as an instructional strategy.}

Relying on two independent samples of offenders and two measures of criminal thinking, the current studies examined whether four demographic factors—gender, race, age, and education—moderated the relationship between criminal thinking and recidivism. Study 1 consisted of 226 drug-involved probationers enrolled in a randomized clinical trial. Study 2 consisted of 346 jail inmates from a longitudinal study. Logistic regression models suggested that the strength of the relationship between criminal thinking and subsequent recidivism did not vary based on participant demographics, regardless of justice system setting or measure of criminal thinking. Criminal thinking predicts recidivism similarly for people who are male, female, Black, White, older, younger, and more or less educated.}

Research showing increasing time and resource pressure on journalists has led to concerns about the demise of investigative reporting and the ability of today’s journalists to interrogate information adequately. Some digital innovations (e.g. tools facilitating robot journalism) have been viewed with suspicion by newsrooms. This paper reports on a research project that seeks to create an innovative tool to support the creative capabilities of time and resource poor journalists. The INJECT project used the advanced information discovery capabilities of digitisation to help journalists find new angles on stories and this paper analyses the extent to which such initiatives might harness digital innovation to benefit both the quality and range of reporting and thereby enhance creativity. It examines the potential of an information processing model of creativity derived from the INJECT tool to assist and support journalists, exploring the theoretical impact as well as the practical implications reported from the newsroom.}

The field is currently in need of clearly articulated steps to theory specification and development, particularly regarding frameworks that may generalize across different fields of psychology. Here we focus on two approaches to theory specification and development that are typically associated with distinct research traditions: computational modeling and construct validation. We outline the points of convergence and divergence between them to illuminate the anatomy of a scientific theory in psychology—what a well-specified theory should contain and how it should be interrogated and revised through iterative theory-development processes. We propose how these two approaches can be used in complementary ways to increase the quality of explanations and the precision of predictions offered by psychological theories.}

abstract = {With the current shift of increasing the computational power of a processor by including multiple cores instead of increasing the clock frequency, consideration of computational efficiency is gaining increased importance for computational fluid dynamics codes. This is especially critical for applications that require high throughput. For example, applying computational fluid dynamics simulations to multi-disciplinary design optimization requires a large number of similar simulations with different input parameters. Therefore, a reduction in the runtime of the code can lead to large reduction in the design process. In our case study, a two-dimensional, block-structured computational fluid dynamics code was optimized for performance on machines with hierarchical memory systems. This paper illustrates the techniques applied to transform an initial version of the code to an optimized version that yielded performance improvements of 10% for very small cases to about 50% for large test cases that did not fit into the cache memory of the target processor. A detailed performance analysis of the code starting at the global level down to subroutines and data structures is presented in this paper. The performance improvements can be explained through a reduction of cache misses in all levels of the memory hierarchy. The L1 cache misses were reduced by about 50%, the L2 cache misses by about 80% and the translation lookaside buffer misses by about 90% for the optimized version of the code. The code performance was also evaluated for multi-core processors, where efficiency is especially important when several instances of an application are running simultaneously. In this case, the most optimized version, a blocked version of the optimized code, more effectively maintained efficiency as more cores were activated compared to the unblocked version. This illustrates that optimizing cache performance may be increasingly important as the number of cores per processor continues to rise.}

Ongoing worldwide computerization has led to completely new opportunities for social scientists to conceive human interactions and relations in unknown precision and quantities. However, the large data sets require techniques that are more likely to be found in computer and natural sciences than in the established fields of social relations. In order to facilitate the participation of social scientists in an emerging interdisciplinary research branch of “computational social science,” we propose in this article the usage of the Python programming language. First, we carve out its capacity to handle “Big Data” in suitable formats. Second, we introduce programming libraries to analyze large networks and big text corpora, conduct simulations, and compare their performance to their counterparts in the R environment. Furthermore, we highlight practical tools implemented in Python for operational tasks like preparing presentations. Finally, we discuss how the process of writing code may help to exemplify theoretical concepts and could lead to empirical applications that gain a better understanding of the social processes initiated by the truly global connections of the Internet era.}

abstract = {People spend most of their time indoors; therefore, maintaining a good indoor air quality and meeting the requirements of comfort and energy efficiency are essential. One of the most widespread strategies to achieve this objective is improving ventilation efficiency; therefore, the main aim of this study was to show an optimization of the ventilation efficiency, in a specific room, considering 47 variations (case studies) in the furniture arrangement. For this purpose, a numerical analysis using computational fluid dynamics techniques, validated by the tracer gas decay technique, was used to assess the distribution of the age of air within the space. The concept of “age of air” was implemented in the computational fluid dynamics code through user-defined functions, using the steady-state method based on the resolution of a transport equation for an additional scalar. Variations up to 5.75% in the ventilation efficiency between the cases studied have been achieved. It is concluded that an improvement up to 1.65% can be obtained when the elements of the study are introduced in a way that facilitates the air movement towards the exhaust; therefore, improvement of the ventilation efficiency through specific furniture distributions is possible, although not significant, according to the outcomes.}

abstract = {Computational design of small molecule putative inhibitors of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is presented. Plk1, which regulates the cell cycle, is often over expressed in cancers. Down regulation of Plk1 has been shown to inhibit tumor progression. Most kinase inhibitors interact with the ATP binding site on Plk1, which is highly conserved. This makes the development of Plk1-specific inhibitors challenging, since different kinases have similar ATP sites. However, Plk1 also contains a unique region called the polo-box domain (PBD), which is absent from other kinases. In this study, the PBD site was used as a target for designed Plk1 putative inhibitors. Common structural features of several experimentally known Plk1 ligands were first identified. The findings were used to design small molecules that specifically bonded Plk1. Drug likeness and possible toxicities of the molecules were investigated. Molecules with no implied toxicities and optimal drug likeness values were used for docking studies. Several molecules were identified that made stable complexes only with Plk1 and LYN kinases, but not with other kinases. One molecule was found to bind exclusively the PBD site of Plk1. Possible utilization of the designed molecules in drugs against cancers with over expressed Plk1 is discussed.}

Several case studies are presented in this article to show the scope and applicability of such methods. These include solid–fluid interaction in screw compressors, prediction of flow generated noise in screw machines, cavitation modelling in gear pumps, and flow in multiphase pumps for oil and gas industry. Numerical grids for all these cases were generated by the authors using an in-house grid generator, while the CFD calculations were performed with a variety of commercially available CFD codes. In order to validate the accuracy of the CFD calculations, an extended test programme was carried out using laser Doppler velocimetry to measure the mean and fluctuating velocity distribution in screw compressor flow domains. The measurement results are then compared with the CFD simulations. The results confirm the viability of the developed techniques. It is shown in this publication that the flexibility of the developed method creates further opportunities for a broader use of CFD for analysis of twin screw machines in a range of new applications.}

abstract = {Introduction A radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the best choice for achieving vascular access (VA) for hemodialysis, but this AVF has high rates of early failure due to juxta-anastomotic stenosis, making it impossible to use for dialysis. Low hemodynamic shear stress contributes to the pathophysiology of VA failure due to secondary thrombosis, stenosis, and re-occlusion after percutaneous intervention. Methods We used a computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) approach to evaluate the shear stress distribution and minimize its effects under various conditions including changes in the anastomosis angle. A three-dimensional computational domain was designed for arteriovenous end-to-side anastomosis based on anastomosis angles of 45°, 90° and including 135° angle of an obtuse anastomosis using three-dimensional design software. COMSOL Multiphysics® simulation software was used to identify the hemodynamic factors influencing wall shear stress at the anastomosis site using a low Reynolds number k-ε turbulence model that included non-Newtonian blood flow characteristics, the complete cardiac pulse cycle, and distention of blood vessels. In preliminary clinical study, all 201 patients who received a radiocephalic wrist AVF from January 2009 to February 2014 were divided into classic and obtuse angle groups. Results The CFD results showed that the largest anastomosis angle (135°) resulted in lower shear stress, which would help reduce AVF failures. This obtuse angle was preferred, as it minimized the development of anastomotic stenosis and tended to favor primary and primary-assisted patency in clinical study. Conclusions An obtuse radiocephalic wrist AVF shows more favorable patency compared to a classic radiocephalic AVF. Surgeons establishing a radiocephalic wrist AVF would be better to consider an AVF with an obtuse anastomosis.}

abstract = {Narrative can be conceptualised as a complex system, with pragmatic benefits for our description of interpretative and affective processes involved in reading. In this article, I show how systemic thinking has shaped many literary theories, and I offer some suggestions about the modelling of narrative as a complex system. Considering the relations between text, reader, and reading situation as constitutive of narrative requires a way of looking at stories keeping in mind that the reader’s experiential background, their cognitive-affective states, and the situational context all play a crucial role in the emergence of what we call a narrative. Here I suggest that Transformer-based language models can be considered artificial systems that simulate a (disembodied) reading process and make it possible to model narrative as a complex system, including the encoded experiential background of the (simulated) reader.}

abstract = {Abstract A computational intelligence (CI)-based approach is presented for prognostics of machine conditions using morphological signal processing (MSP). The machine vibration signals are processed using MSP to extract a novel entropy-based health index (HI) characterizing the signal shape-size complexity for system prognostics. The progression of HI is predicted using CI techniques, namely, recursive neural network (RNN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and support vector regression (SVR). Both single- and multi-step ahead predictions were evaluated through benchmark datasets of non-linear, non-stationary, and chaotic time series solutions of Mackey-Glass and Lorenz equations. The prognostic effectiveness of the CI techniques was illustrated using a vibration dataset of a helicopter drive-train system gearbox. For each CI predictor, both training datasets gave almost similar prediction performance. In training, the performance of ANFIS was the best, followed by SVR and RNN. In test, the best performance was obtained with SVR for both single- and multi-step ahead predictions. The results are helpful in understanding the relationship between the system conditions, the corresponding indicating feature, the level of degradation, and their progression.}

abstract = {Objective This study develops a computational model to predict drivers’ response time and understand the underlying cognitive mechanism for freeway exiting takeovers in conditionally automated vehicles (AVs). Background Previous research has modeled drivers’ takeover response time in emergency scenarios that demand a quick response. However, existing models may not be applicable for scheduled, non-time-critical takeovers as drivers take longer to resume control when there is no time pressure. A model of driver response time in non-time-critical takeovers is lacking. Method A computational cognitive model of driver takeover response time is developed based on Queuing Network-Model Human Processor (QN-MHP) architecture. The model quantifies gaze redirection in response to takeover request (ToR), task prioritization, driver situation awareness, and driver trust to address the complexities of drivers’ takeover strategies when sufficient time budget exists. Results Experimental data of a preliminary driving simulator study were used to validate the model. The model accounted for 97% of the experimental takeover response time for freeway exiting. Conclusion The current model can successfully predict drivers’ response time for scheduled, non-time-critical freeway exiting takeovers in conditionally AVs. Application This model can be applied to the human-machine interface design with respect to ToR lead time for enhancing safe freeway exiting takeovers in conditionally AVs. It also provides a foundation for future modeling work towards an integrated driver model of freeway exiting takeover performance.}

abstract = {We present the concept of a theory machine, which is an atemporal computational formalism that is deployable within an arbitrary logical system. Theory machines are intended to capture computation on an arbitrary system, both physical and unphysical, including quantum computers, Blum-Shub-Smale machines, and infinite time Turing machines. We demonstrate that for finite problems, the computational power of any device characterisable by a finite first-order theory machine is equivalent to that of a Turing machine. Whereas for infinite problems, their computational power is equivalent to that of a type-2 machine. We then develop a concept of complexity for theory machines, and prove that the class of problems decidable by a finite first order theory machine with polynomial resources is equal to 𝒩𝒫 ∩ co-𝒩𝒫.}
