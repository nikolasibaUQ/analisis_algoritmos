abstract = {This article suggests to quantitative methodologists that the tools that they use (and often others they do not) are more broadly applicable than is often assumed; to reflexivist researchers that there are many more tools available to their research than are often seen as appropriate; and to the IR discipline writ large that most of the disciplinary thinking about the relationships between research, ontology, epistemology, methodology and methods is unnecessarily narrow. Our core goal is to reveal the problematically inaccurate nature of both the qualitative/quantitative and the positivist/post-positivist divides, as well as of traditional methods training. We suggest that the ability to pair, and the utility of pairing, quantitative (traditionally neopositivist) methods with critical (traditionally non-neopositivist) theorising makes this intervention. To this end, the article begins with discussions of the relationships between epistemology and method in IR research. We continue on to frame a disunity of social science in the quantitative/qualitative divide, which lays the groundwork for a section rethinking traditional understandings of how methods, methodology, and epistemology relate. We then make the case for the utility of methods traditionally classified as ‘quantitative’ for critical research in IR. The article concludes by discussing the transformative implications of this understanding for critical theorising, and for theorising knowledge within disciplinary IR.}

abstract = {This paper compares the use of scripting languages and visual programming languages for teaching computational design concepts to novice and advanced architecture students. Both systems are described and discussed in terms of the representation methods they use. With novice students better results were obtained with the visual programming language. However, the generative strategies used were restricted to parametric variation and the use of randomness. Scripting, on the other hand, was used by advanced students to implement rule-based generative systems. It is possible to conclude that visual languages can be very useful for making architecture students understand general programming concepts, but scripting languages are fundamental for implementing generative design systems. The paper also discusses the importance of the ability to shift between different representation methods, from more concrete to more abstract, as part of the architectural education.}

abstract = {We present a new method for personality assessment at a distance to uncover personality structure in historical texts. We focus on how two 19th century authors understood and described human personality; we apply a new bottom–up computational approach to extract personality dimensions used by Jane Austen and Charles Dickens to describe fictional characters in 21 novels. We matched personality descriptions using three person–description dictionaries marker scales as reference points for interpretation. Factor structures did not show strong convergence with the contemporary Big Five model. Jane Austen described characters in terms of social and emotional richness with greater nuances but using a less extensive vocabulary. Charles Dickens, in contrast, used a rich and diverse personality vocabulary, but those descriptions centred around more restricted dimensions of power and dominance. Although we could identify conceptually similar factors across the two authors, analyses of the overlapping vocabulary between the two authors suggested only moderate convergence. We discuss the utility and potential of automated text analysis and the lexical hypothesis to (i) provide insights into implicit personality models in historical texts and (ii) bridge the divide between idiographic and nomothetic perspectives. © 2020 European Association of Personality Psychology}

What does this change mean for the future of geography as a discipline? At this critical juncture, there is potential to rethink the position of the digital in geographical thought and praxis – to move beyond apparently common-sense categorizations of real and virtual, representation and reality. This commentary considers the implications of the contemporary push toward ‘metaversal’ thinking for geographical theory as well as the significance of virtual world-making for geographical theorizations of digital space and place. I suggest that key thinkers on space and media geographies must be re-evaluated and applied to this new wave of digital development. What is the significance of recent debates around emerging spaces like the metaverse, augmented reality, and virtual reality, understood not as happenings with distinct real and virtual counterparts, but as geographical – spatial – phenomena?}

abstract = {Purpose To evaluate the displacement forces acting on an aortic endograft when the iliac limbs are crossed (“ballerina” position). Methods An endograft model was computationally reconstructed based on data from a patient whose infrarenal aortic aneurysm had an endovascular stent-graft implanted with the iliac limbs crossed. Computational fluid dynamics analysis determined the maximum displacement force on the endograft and separately on the bifurcation and iliac limbs. Its analogue model was reconstructed for comparison, assuming the neck, main body, and total length constant but considering the iliac limbs to be deployed in the usual bifurcated mode. Calculations were repeated after developing “idealized” models of both the bifurcated and crossed-limbs endografts with straight main bodies and no neck angulation or curved iliac segments. Results The vector of the total force was directed anterocaudal for both the typical bifurcated and the crossed-limbs configurations, with the forces in the latter slightly reduced and the vertical component accounting for most of the force in both configurations. Idealized crossed-limbs and bifurcated configurations differed only in the force on the iliac limbs, but this difference disappeared in the realistic models. Conclusion Crossing of the iliac limbs can slightly affect the direction of the displacement forces. Although this configuration can exert larger forces on the limbs than in the bifurcated mode, this effect can be blunted by concomitant modifications in the geometry of the main body and other parts of the endograft, making its hemodynamic behavior resemble that of a typically positioned endograft.}

abstract = {Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) has been shown to be an effective technology for reducing the airborne bioburden in indoor environments and is already advocated as a potential infection control measure for healthcare settings. However, much of the understanding of UVGI performance is based on experimental studies or numerical simulation in mechanically ventilated environments. This study considers the application of an upper-room UVGI system in a naturally ventilated multi-bed hospital ward. A computational fluid dynamics model is used to simulate a Nightingale-type hospital ward with wind-driven cross-ventilation and three wall-mounted UVGI fixtures. A parametric study considering 50 different fixture configurations and three ventilation rates was carried out using a design of experiments approach. Each configuration was assessed by calculating the UV dose distribution over the ward and at each bed. Results show that dose is influenced by the location of the fixtures and the ventilation regime. Thermal effects are likely to be important at low ventilation rates and may reduce UV effectiveness. A metamodel-based numerical optimisation was applied at a ventilation rate of 6 air changes per hour. In this case, the optimum result is achieved when UVGI fixtures are mounted on the leeward wall at their lowest mounting height.}

abstract = {To date, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, in almost all of the studies performed around the hemodynamics of bileaflet mechanical heart valves, a heart rate of 70–72 beats/min has been considered. In fact, the heart rate of ~72 beats/min does not represent the entire normal physiological conditions under which the aortic or prosthetic valves function. The heart rates of 120 or 50 beats/min may lead to hemodynamic complications, such as plaque formation and/or thromboembolism in patients. In this study, the hemodynamic performance of the bileaflet mechanical heart valves in a wide range of normal and physiological heart rates, that is, 60–150 beats/min, was studied in the opening phase. The model considered in this study was a St. Jude Medical bileaflet mechanical heart valve with the inner diameter of 27 mm in the aortic position. The hemodynamics of the native valve and the St. Jude Medical valve were studied in a variety of heart rates in the opening phase and the results were carefully compared. The results indicate that peak values of the velocity profile downstream of the valve increase as heart rate increases, as well as the location of the maximum velocity changes with heart rate in the St. Jude Medical valve model. Also, the maximum values of shear stress and wall shear stresses downstream of the valve are proportional to heart rate in both models. Interestingly, the maximum shear stress and wall shear stress values in both models are in the same range when heart rate is <90 beats/min; however, these values significantly increase in the St. Jude Medical valve model when heart rate is >90 beats/min (up to ~40% growth compared to that of the native valve). The findings of this study may be of importance in the hemodynamic performance of bileaflet mechanical heart valves. They may also play an important role in design improvement of conventional prosthetic heart valves and the design of the next generation of prosthetic valves, such as percutaneous valves.}

abstract = {This study investigated the effects of intercalation and exfoliation of the graphite flake particles on the mechanical properties of elastomeric composites using analytical, computational, and experimental techniques. Relying on the modified Eshelby and incremental Mori–Tanaka approach, a new micromechanics model was proposed to estimate Young’s modulus and develop a constitutive model for expanded graphite (EG)-filled elastomer in finite strain deformation. It was found that when the initial graphite flakes expanded, the actual volume fraction and ultimate aspect ratio of the dispersed particles significantly affected the mechanical properties of the EG-reinforced composites. The present model and subsequent predictions reflect the initial flake diameter, actual volume fraction, ultimate aspect ratio of the particles, and other convenient physical properties of the composite constituents. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to evaluate the elastic properties of the EG-Matrix interphase region using the COMPASS force field function. The MD results showed that Young’s modulus of the interphase region increased significantly as the quantity of the graphene layer increased. The micromechanics-constitutive model results were validated using the experimentally determined stress–strain relation of the composites. EG- and CB-elastomer nanocomposite specimens were fabricated and tested in the experimental program. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis of the cryo-fractured surfaces of the elastomer compounds showed good interactions between the constituents. Numerical computations indicated that the proposed model incorporating the new parameters could accurately predict the experiment at a small particle concentration.}

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the general problem of de termining the time history of an unknown input signal, given only the recorded response of a known physical sys tem excited by the unknown input. The particular case considered is determination of true thrust from the re corded test stand response, with the physical system re sponse noise superimposed upon the thrust data. Passive or numerical filtering can smooth the trace, but these methods will attenuate the signal within a particular fre quency band, and thus may distort the data content of the recorded response. The paper describes analog computer techniques that can be used to reconstruct data distorted by such physical system response. The data may be recovered through an “active filtering” process, even when it contains compo nents of a higher frequency than the response noise being removed. Several examples are shown, including one case where the original signal was recovered intact even though the input signal excited a system resonance by passing through the natural frequency of the simulated test stand. The method described is not restricted to linear systems, but can take into account such nonlinearities as changing rocket booster mass, and nonlinear damping and spring force versus deflection relationships. The major require ment is to obtain sufficient information to permit deriva tion of a realistic mathematical model of the physical sys tem used for test and measurement purposes.}

abstract = {Hand sanitization by healthcare staff remains one of the most effective ways for controlling infection in healthcare settings. However, predicting faithful adherence to Hand Hygiene Compliance (HHC) is difficult in complex environments such as inpatient hospital settings. The main challenge is understanding how different components of human and built systems interact to achieve specific goals such as HHC at the critical moments of care delivery. The aim of this explorative study was to evaluate how Human Factors derived visual salience cues and proximity-compatibility principles might be used in the design of healthcare spaces to support nurse moments of HHC through increased perceived behavioral control and intention. The investigative team used a Collaborative Computational Scenario Planning (CCSP) Model approach to determine the integrative effects of reinforcing and detracting operational and environmental factors on discrete moments of HHC behavior. Supervised Machine Learning analysis was conducted on data collected by a large academic medical center that included HHC observance in clinical staff spanning from 2017 to 2021 in two inpatient hospital units. The probabilistic outcomes of unit based HHC observance likelihood were used to compute Fuzzy Cognitive Model Edge Probabilities between Hand Hygiene (HH) cues and detected HHC at key moments. Hospital infection control experts were then engaged to identify the weight of various reinforcing and detracting operational and environmental factors contributing to HHC observance. Combining the quantitative and qualitative methods, allowed the team to then develop integrative CCSP models which facilitated predictive insight into the development of targeted environmental improvements that might contribute to HHC control and intention to support safer patient care.}

abstract = {The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in journalism has sparked complex ethical debates, particularly with the rise of generative AI systems. By now, AI permeates the entire news cycle, from information gathering to news dissemination, raising questions revolving around issues such as transparency, accountability, responsibility, bias, and diversity. Previous research showed that news organizations have slowly approached and adapted to ethical concerns regarding the use of AI, developing critical stances mainly due to rising AI power, growing audience skepticism, and mounting tensions within the industry between news publishers’ strategies and journalists’ anxieties. Consequently, ethical guidelines have started to emerge in news organizations, but their practical application remains challenging and under-studied, not only due to the opacity of AI algorithms, but also due to the difficulties of “embedding” journalistic values into AI systems. In the light of an intensifying discourse about ethical concerns in the news industry and growing efforts by governments and institutions such as the European Union to strengthen AI governance, journalism studies have started to explore the issue as well. However, research on AI ethics is still in its infancy, with significant gaps in understanding the practical enforcement of ethical guidelines within newsrooms, in particular when it comes to the design of AI systems. This essay critically discusses the way journalism (studies) approach ethical issues related to the use and the design of AI systems, given that the responsible use and design of AI systems in journalism is crucial given its integral role for democracy and society.}

To randomize each respondent to a group and treatment and to test of several hypotheses simultaneously, two by two factorial design was used. An online survey (N = 1160) on Iranian social media revealed that overclaiming and social approval are positively related to sharing fake news on social media. Surprisingly, analytical thinking yielded no significance. We believe that in order to show more knowledge users tend to share information with high social approval irrespective of their credibility. Although CRT proved no relation with sharing, significant differences among male and female users were found. The proven relation between sharing more and overclaiming more reveals a marketing opportunity. Gamification of communication which provides a vehicle for users to overclaim their knowledge to their peers on social media might be a suitable strategy on social media to spread the message.}

Several different initial conditions of heterogeneity of an air-fuel or air-fuel-EGR gas mixture were given at the intake valve closing time by a new method, which generated statistically reasonable turbulent fluctuations in both velocity and fuel mass fraction fields. The autoignition and combustion behaviours were analysed for several different sets of the r.m.s. and the length scale of the fluctuations in the fuel mass fraction. The analyses show that the combination of a larger r.m.s. value and a longer-length scale of the fluctuations in fuel mass fraction is effective to slow the combustion in a hot flame reaction phase and to avoid knocking. The analytical results also show that the heterogeneous distribution of an EGR gas has a considerable effect in making the combustion slower, even when a fuel-air mixture is homogeneous.}

abstract = {Due to the low electricity prices in central Europe, cost optimisations related to all parts of a new hydropower plant have become increasingly important. In case of a run-of-river hydropower plant using a vertical axis Kaplan turbine, one of the cost drivers are the excavation works. Thus, a decisive factor for the reduction of construction costs is the minimisation of the construction depth of the elbow-type draft tube. In course of the design phase of a new hydropower plant in Austria, an analysis of the impact of draft tube modifications on the performance of the Kaplan turbine was carried out by applying computational fluid dynamics. The net head of the turbine with a diameter of D = 3.15 m accounts for Hnet = 9.00 m and the maximum discharge per unit is Qmax = 57.5 m3/s. After it was proven that there is a good agreement of the numerically calculated and experimentally measured turbine efficiency for the original turbine configuration, various draft tube designs were tested in order to find out their impact on the turbine efficiency and to analyse the sources of draft tube losses in detail. Finally, it was possible to find a new draft tube design representing a compromise of reduced construction costs and acceptable turbine efficiency.}

abstract = {This article presents the results from exploring the impact of using a parametric design tool on designers’ behavior in terms of using design patterns in the early conceptual development stage of designing. It is based on an empirical cognitive study in which eight architectural designers were asked to complete two architectural design tasks with similar complexity, respectively, in a parametric design environment and a geometric modeling environment. The protocol analysis method was employed to study the designers’ behavior. In order to explore the development of design patterns in the empirical data, Markov model analysis is utilized. Through Markov models analysis of the parametric design environment and geometric modeling environment results, it was found that there are some significantly different design patterns being used when designing in a parametric design environment compared to designing in a geometric modeling environment. The article articulates these differences and draws conclusions from these results.}
