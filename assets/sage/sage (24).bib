abstract = {The teaching of computational fluid dynamics at the undergraduate level usually focuses on giving students an understanding of the numerical methods and details involved, supported by what are little more than code fragments, followed by learning an abstract form of computational fluid dynamics skills and processes, without any real interaction with the complex core computer coding behind what is often just ‘easy-to-use’ or ‘push button’ commercial interfaces. Quite often, as the student progresses in his/her use of computational fluid dynamics, especially in the research area, it becomes clear that an ‘off-the-shelf’ commercial computational fluid dynamics package is not able to satisfy all requirements to simulate a given problem fully, nor to obtain accurate results. The purpose of this paper is to outline what must be taught to add computer coding to what usually is a well-protected, though capable of being compiled and linked, core computer code so that the complexity of interacting is lessened and better understood.}

By “computational journalism” the article refers to the increasingly ubiquitous forms of algorithmic, social scientific, and mathematical forms of newswork adopted by many 21st-century newsrooms and touted by many educational institutions as “the future of news.” By “sociological approach,” the article endorses a research model that brackets, at least temporarily, many of the current industry concerns with the practical usability of newsroom analysis. The bulk of the article outlines a series of six lenses through which such an approach to computational journalism might be carried out. Four of these lenses are drawn from Schudson’s classic typology of the sociology of news—economic, political, cultural, and organizational approaches. In addition, the author adds Bordieuean field approaches and technological lenses to the mix. In each instance, the author discusses how particular approaches might need to be modified in order to study computational journalism in the digital age.}

abstract = {Computational Intelligence (CI) is a computer science discipline encompassing the theory, design, development and application of biologically and linguistically derived computational paradigms. Traditionally, the main elements of CI are Evolutionary Computation, Swarm Intelligence, Fuzzy Logic, and Neural Networks. CI aims at proposing new algorithms able to solve complex computational problems by taking inspiration from natural phenomena. In an intriguing turn of events, these nature-inspired methods have been widely adopted to investigate a plethora of problems related to nature itself. In this paper we present a variety of CI methods applied to three problems in life sciences, highlighting their effectiveness: we describe how protein folding can be faced by exploiting Genetic Programming, the inference of haplotypes can be tackled using Genetic Algorithms, and the estimation of biochemical kinetic parameters can be performed by means of Swarm Intelligence. We show that CI methods can generate very high quality solutions, providing a sound methodology to solve complex optimization problems in life sciences.}

This research, therefore, offers unique insights from semi-structured interviews with data journalists and data editors based at, or working as freelancers for, the mainstream news organisations of these regions. The results suggest that data journalism in these devolved nations displays a distinctive character just as much as it reinforces the norms and rituals of the legacy organisations that pioneered this practice.

abstract = {Image-based computational modeling is becoming an increasingly used clinical tool to provide insight into the mechanisms of reentrant arrhythmias. In the context of ischemic heart disease, faithful representation of the electrophysiological properties of the infarct region within models is essential, due to the scars known for arrhythmic properties. Here, we review the different computational representations of the infarcted region, summarizing the experimental measurements upon which they are based. We then focus on the two most common representations of the scar core (complete insulator or electrically passive tissue) and perform simulations of electrical propagation around idealized infarct geometries. Our simulations highlight significant differences in action potential duration and focal effective refractory period (ERP) around the scar, driven by differences in electrotonic loading, depending on the choice of scar representation. Finally, a novel mechanism for arrhythmia induction, following a focal ectopic beat, is demonstrated, which relies on localized gradients in ERP directly caused by the electrotonic sink effects of the neighboring passive scar.}

However, their relationship may be obscured by traditional scoring methods. Objectives: To study the computational basis underlying decision-making impairments in MS and their interaction with neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric measures. Methods: Twenty-nine MS patients and 26 matched control subjects completed a computer version of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Participants underwent neurocognitive evaluation using an expanded version of the Brief Repeatable Battery. Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis was used to estimate three established computational models to compare parameters between groups. Results: Patients showed increased learning rate and reduced loss-aversion during decision-making relative to control subjects. These alterations were associated with: (1) reduced net gains in the IGT; (2) processing speed, executive functioning and memory impairments; and (3) higher levels of depression and current apathy. Conclusion: Decision-making deficits in MS patients could be described by the interplay between latent computational processes, neurocognitive impairments, and mood/motivational symptoms.}

abstract = {CFD (Computational fluid dynamics) is a tool, through which, the entire combustion process for pulverized coal combustion (PCC) can be predicted. The solid fuel combustion modeling is not as simple as gaseous or liquid fuel combustion modeling. In the solid fuel combustion process, various physical transformations and chemical reactions occur simultaneously. Therefore in the computational modeling approach for PCC, basic physical and chemical processes such as; turbulence, radiation, devolatilization, gas-phase combustion, char reaction and soot formation/reduction are integrated to obtain the desired results. However, in order to reach the desired accuracy, different computational models should be chosen carefully. In this review, various common models that are widely used in PCC simulation are discussed scientifically along with their modeling aspects. The basic advantages and disadvantages of these models are also discussed in this study. Moreover, different models preferred by various authors for pulverized coal combustion simulation process are also summarized. From the review, it has been observed that the eddy viscosity based two-equation turbulent models and Eulerian-Lagrangian multiphase approach are mostly preferred due to better computational economy. Two competing rate devolatilization model from various finite rate models and FG-DVC devolatilization model from various phenomenological models are mostly used for PCC. Diffusion kinetic control and Intrinsic char combustion models are mostly chosen to predict the char reaction. Finite reaction rate models are preferred when the computational economy is a concern, whereas phenomenological models provide results with better accuracy because in phenomenological models realistic inputs are given as input for simulation whereas, in finite rate models, finite rate constants are mostly empirical. Most of the gas phase models are given almost equal importance. Discrete ordinate (DO) is mostly used for PCC due to its ability of volumetric radiation calculation and the ability to evaluate radiation effect on the particle phase.}

Results are presented from a CFD model that contains all the essential features of the precalciner as operated when burning coal. The model fully represents the reactions and fluid dynamics of the precalciner. Previously unidentified features are illustrated. Certain key features at points in the precalciner, where some limited measurements can be made, are compared with the parameters indicated by the computational model. The measurements are consistent with the results calculated by the model indicating fair validation. The CFD data show the following 1 The gases undergo distinct recirculation. 2 The coal particles entering at one inlet have significantly different trajectories and temperature histories from those entering at the second diametrically opposed inlet. 3 There is 90 per cent completion of coal combustion at the exit. 4 73 per cent limestone in the raw meal is calcined to calcined to calcium oxide at the exit from the precalciner. 5 The highest reaction rate of the raw meal is closer to one side of the vessel due to interaction with the gas flows. Future work is proposed which, firstly, will provide further validation of the results so far attained by selective measurements on the precalciner and, secondly, will model the combustion and aerodynamic behaviour of waste-derived fuels in the precalciner vessel, commencing with shredded car tyre chips.}

abstract = {Advanced non-linear dynamics, finite element computational methods and tools are utilized in order to assess the blast wave mitigation potential of the fluid–structure interaction phenomena involving rigid and deformable structures. The employed computational methods and tools are verified and validated by first demonstrating that they can quite accurately reproduce analytical solutions for a couple of well-defined blast wave propagation and interaction problems. Then the methods/tools are used to investigate the fluid–structure interaction phenomena involving deformable structures while accounting for both the interaction of the incident blast wave with the structure and for the structure-motion induced blast wave (at the back-face of the structure). To assess the role of the structure deformability, i.e. the role of the shock waves generated within the structure, the results obtained are compared with their rigid structure counterparts. This comparison established that no additional structure-deformability-related blast-mitigation effects are observed in the case of fully supported blast wave loading while, under exponentially decaying blast wave loading, such effects are observed but only under conditions when the shock wave propagation time within the structure is comparable with the incident wave decay time.}

abstract = {Psychology endeavors to develop theories of human capacities and behaviors on the basis of a variety of methodologies and dependent measures. We argue that one of the most divisive factors in psychological science is whether researchers choose to use computational modeling of theories (over and above data) during the scientific-inference process. Modeling is undervalued yet holds promise for advancing psychological science. The inherent demands of computational modeling guide us toward better science by forcing us to conceptually analyze, specify, and formalize intuitions that otherwise remain unexamined—what we dub open theory. Constraining our inference process through modeling enables us to build explanatory and predictive theories. Here, we present scientific inference in psychology as a path function in which each step shapes the next. Computational modeling can constrain these steps, thus advancing scientific inference over and above the stewardship of experimental practice (e.g., preregistration). If psychology continues to eschew computational modeling, we predict more replicability crises and persistent failure at coherent theory building. This is because without formal modeling we lack open and transparent theorizing. We also explain how to formalize, specify, and implement a computational model, emphasizing that the advantages of modeling can be achieved by anyone with benefit to all.}

This review investigated how groups were modeled, for what purpose, what group elements were modeled, and whether social science informed the model design. Qualitative methods were used to analyze 119 published articles.

abstract = {Several studies based on in vivo or in vitro models have found promising results for the noble gas argon in neuroprotection against ischaemic pathologies. The development of argon as a medicinal product includes the requirement for toxicity testing through non-clinical studies. The long exposure period of animals (rats) during several days results in technical and logistic challenges related to the gas administration. In particular, a minimum of 10 air changes per hour (ACH) to maintain animal welfare results in extremely large volumes of experimental gas required if the gas is not recirculated. The difficulty with handling the many cylinders prompted the development of such a recirculation-based design. To distribute the recirculating gas to individually ventilated cages and monitor them properly was deemed more difficult than constructing a single large enclosure that will hold several open cages. To address these concerns, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the preliminary design was performed. A purpose-made exposure chamber was designed based on the CFD simulations. Comparisons of the simulation results to measurements of gas concentration at two cage positions while filling show that the CFD results compare well to these limited experiments. Thus, we believe that the CFD results are representative of the gas distribution throughout the enclosure. The CFD shows that the design provides better gas distribution (i.e. a higher effective air change rate) than predicted by 10 ACH.}

abstract = {In recent years it has become clear that carcinogenesis is a complex process, both at the molecular and cellular levels. Understanding the origins, growth and spread of cancer, therefore requires an integrated or system-wide approach. Computational systems biology is an emerging sub-discipline in systems biology that utilizes the wealth of data from genomic, proteomic and metabolomic studies to build computer simulations of intra and intercellular processes. Several useful descriptive and predictive models of the origin, growth and spread of cancers have been developed in an effort to better understand the disease and potential therapeutic approaches. In this review we describe and assess the practical and theoretical underpinnings of commonly-used modeling approaches, including ordinary and partial differential equations, petri nets, cellular automata, agent based models and hybrid systems. A number of computer-based formalisms have been implemented to improve the accessibility of the various approaches to researchers whose primary interest lies outside of model development. We discuss several of these and describe how they have led to novel insights into tumor genesis, growth, apoptosis, vascularization and therapy.}

The boat is a pontoon catamaran with hinged engine pods and elevated payload supported by suspension and articulation systems. Computational fluid dynamics models specific to WAM-V are developed which include hinged pod dynamics, water-jet propulsion modeling, and immersed boundary method for flow in the gap between pontoon and pod. Multi-body dynamics modeling for the suspension and upper-structure dynamic is developed in MATLAB Simulink. Coupled equations of motion are developed and solved iteratively through either one-way or two-way coupling methods to converge on flow-field, pontoon motions, pod motions, waterjet forces, and suspension motions. Validation experiments include cylinder drop with suspended mass and 33-feet WAM-V sea-trials in calm water and waves. Computational results show that two-way coupling is necessary to capture the physics of the interactions. The experimental trends are predicted well and errors are mostly comparable to those for rigid boats, however, in some cases the errors are larger, which is expected due to the complexity of the current studies.

abstract = {Representative democracy translates the preferences of the electorate into policy outcomes. Individual voters do not directly vote on policy; rather, their elected representatives create and establish policy. How well do the institutions of representative democracy translate the preferences of the electorate into policy? Is there any systematic bias in a representative democracy system? After formulating a series of computational models it appears that the degree to which legislative districts are ‘gerrymandered’ with respect to preferences about the policy is a source of policy bias. To illustrate the phenomenon, household income is used as a proxy for voters’ preferences with respect to redistribution. Even when the majority of voters are in favor of redistribution, if districts are constructed with a sufficient level of conservative gerrymandering, the policy outcome under representative democracy will favor far less redistribution than the policy outcome under direct democracy.}

abstract = {Building energy simulations coupled with computational fluid dynamics tools have emerged, recently, as an accurate and effective tool to improve the estimation of energy requirements and thermal comfort in buildings. Building modelers and researchers usually implement this coupling in the boundary conditions of both tools (e.g. surface temperature, ambient temperature, and conductive and convective fluxes). This work reviews how the building energy simulation–computational fluid dynamics coupling has evolved since its first implementation to the present day. Moreover, this article also summarizes and discusses the research studies in which the building energy simulation–computational fluid dynamics coupling has been used to analyze building systems, building components, and building urban configurations. Implementing a building energy simulation–computational fluid dynamics coupling brings a series of benefits when compared with the conventional building energy simulation methodology, a building energy simulation–computational fluid dynamics coupling provides an improvement that ranges between 10% and 50% for estimating the building energy requirements. Moreover, the computation time to implement computational fluid dynamics with information obtained from the building energy simulation could be reduced by as well.}

abstract = {Detailed experimental measurements of a compressor (pressure, temperature, speed) are not easily available because of size, cost, and access difficulties. A comprehensive computer model is necessary to obtain pressure-volume diagrams for the compressor. The valve is a key component of a compressor as it determines both the efficiency and reliability of the compressor. The valves operate as a result of pressure differences between the ports and the gas chamber. Undesired vibrations and fatigue fracture of thin valves (0.2 mm steel sheet) have not been well understood and experimental difficulties do not allow a thorough analysis of the causes. Initial investigations and modifications to KIVA-3V showed this code can be used to model both gas and suction valve motion. Since the code was written for internal combustion engines, its adaptation to compressors proved to be a difficult task, particularly because of the orientation and complexity of valves. Extensive modifications were made to model an angularly moving valve system, however as we moved down from engine scale (10 cm) to compressor scale (1 cm), grid resolution became a challenge from time to time. Preliminary results showed that the design of the suction valve and the chamber impacts the pressure difference between the input port and the gas chamber. The higher the piston speed, the lower the pressure of the gas, making it perhaps more plausible to avoid premature valve closings at higher speeds. Even though it is still under investigation, valve location and the orientation of its loose end makes a difference to the pressure, suggesting that new designs may be necessary by manufacturers. Experimental data will be needed to validate our model and verify our observations. Future steps include adding a discharge valve and a fluid-solid interface (FSI) module to the modified KIVA-3V code in order to predict the motion of the valves as a result of their interaction with the chamber gas.}
