abstract = {The aim of this article was to analyse the employability of currently enrolled secondary education (classes 9–12) students aged 14–21, specifically their functional digital skills. Digital skills are increasingly being recognised as a key foundational skill that also enhances employability. Gaining digital skills at the secondary education is important because it is one of the foundational skills that help prepare students transition to work and prepares them for life. There were three major objectives in this article: (a) to examine the trends and transitions in the acquisition of functional digital skills of currently enrolled secondary school Indian students according to their socio-economic and demographic profiles; (b) empirically investigate the factors influencing the acquisition of functional digital skills in urban areas and (c) examine whether the policy of providing schools with computers has had any discernible impact on the acquisition of functional digital skills of these students. Using the National Statistical Office 2017–2018 data on expenditure on education, we found that at the national level only 42% of the enrolled secondary school students had the ability to operate a computer and 46% had the ability to browse Internet in 2017–2018. The attainment of functional digital skills differed across rural and urban regions. The individual characteristics, socio-economic profile of households and school-related indicators were factors that explained the likelihood of students’ being equipped with functional digital skills. A key result was that students who had digital devices at home were more likely to have functional digital skills. The government had introduced computers in secondary schools in 2004 in India. We found evidence of a positive association between the provision of functional computers at secondary schools and attainment of digital skills, even for students from households with no computers at home. A key policy recommendation is that providing computers at schools can help overcome barriers to access to digital devices at home and improve the attainment of digital skills.

abstract = {This study investigated teachers’ use of knowledge from research on children’s mathematical thinking and how their students’ achievement is influenced as a result. Twenty first grade teachers, assigned randomly to an experimental treatment, participated in a month-long workshop in which they studied a research-based analysis of children’s development of problem-solving skills in addition and subtraction. Other first grade teachers (n = 20) were assigned randomly to a control group. Although instructional practices were not prescribed, experimental teachers taught problem solving significantly more and number facts significantly less than did control teachers. Experimental teachers encouraged students to use a variety of problem-solving strategies, and they listened to processes their students used significantly more than did control teachers. Experimental teachers knew more about individual students’ problem-solving processes, and they believed that instruction should build on students’ existing knowledge more than did control teachers. Students in experimental classes exceeded students in control classes in number fact knowledge, problem solving, reported understanding, and reported confidence in their problem-solving abilities.}

Comparison is made between measured values and, first, a full numerical solution for constant thermophysical properties (viscosity and thermal diffusivity), secondly, the same solution but allowing for their individual and combined variation with temperature and, thirdly, a solution which assumes a series of truncated versions of the fully developed temperature distribution to establish corresponding velocity profiles, allowing for temperature-dependent properties.}

abstract = {Background The Thinking Styles Inventory—developed by Sternberg and Wagner based on Sternberg’s (1988, 1997) earlier theory of mental self-government—was selected for the research in order to assess thinking styles of student teachers. Another reason is that the theoretical constructs, as well as the inventory generated from the theory, have proved to be valuable to assess thinking styles of people in several studies. For example, previous research reported that students differed in their thinking styles depending on their personal characteristics (e.g., Sternberg & Grigorenko, 1995; Zhang, 1999, 2002b, 2001e). However, research found no distinct patterns between thinking styles and personal characteristics of students (e.g., Grigorenko & Sternberg, 1997; Zhang, 2002a). Little research has focused on the study of non-Western students’ thinking styles. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that the thinking styles could also be identified among student teachers in Turkey since the styles are differentiated within a different country and culture. Objectives of Study (1) What is the validity and reliability of the Thinking Styles Inventory (TSI) in assessing thinking styles (TS) among Turkish student teachers? (2) Is the structure of a factor analysis of the TSI consistent with the five dimensions postulated by the theory of mental self-government in a Turkish sample? (3) Are TS of student teachers differentiated based on such socialization variables as gender, age, educational level, type of university attended, and field of study followed? Research Design The study reported here used quantitative methods with a survey sampling design. Subjects The research subjects were comprised of 402 student teachers enrolled in English, mathematics, and science teaching programs at Yildiz Technical University in Istanbul, Turkey. Results The results of factor analysis for construct validity of the inventory addressed 13 sub-scales under the five dimensional constructs with 104 items. Moreover, the total internal reliability of scale was a .92 reliability coefficient. Findings demonstrated that the 13 subscales had internal consistency reliabilities; Cronbach’s alphas of the 13 subscales for these subjects ranged from .61 to .91, as well as item-scale correlation that ranged from .37 to .88. Test re-test reliability for external reliability of subscales was between .63 to .78. When the ANOVA findings of the research is evaluated as a whole, it might be said that the student teachers’ particular thinking styles were differentiated by the socialized variables of gender, age, type of university attended, as well as field of study followed. Conclusions/Recommendations In order to measure thinking styles of students based on a model of broad intellectual styles, the inventory might be used as an efficient instrument. Moreover, the results of this study demonstrated a diversity of thinking styles among the participants. However, further research is needed to clarify the nature of thinking styles as assessed by the inventory at different educational levels and culture to facilitate a better understanding of the thinking styles of students.}

abstract = {With the approval of aducanumab on the “Accelerated Approval Pathway” and the recognition of amyloid load as a surrogate marker, new successful therapeutic approaches will be driven by combination therapy as was the case in oncology after the launch of immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, the sheer number of therapeutic combinations substantially complicates the search for optimal combinations. Data-driven approaches based on large databases or electronic health records can identify optimal combinations and often using artificial intelligence or machine learning to crunch through many possible combinations but are limited to the pharmacology of existing marketed drugs and are highly dependent upon the quality of the training sets. Knowledge-driven in silico modeling approaches use multi-scale biophysically realistic models of neuroanatomy, physiology, and pathology and can be personalized with individual patient comedications, disease state, and genotypes to create ‘virtual twin patients’. Such models simulate effects on action potential dynamics of anatomically informed neuronal circuits driving functional clinical readouts. Informed by data-driven approaches this knowledge-driven modeling could systematically and quantitatively simulate all possible target combinations for a maximal synergistic effect on a clinically relevant functional outcome. This approach seamlessly integrates pharmacokinetic modeling of different therapeutic modalities. A crucial requirement to constrain the parameters is the access to preferably anonymized individual patient data from completed clinical trials with various selective compounds. We believe that the combination of data- and knowledge driven modeling could be a game changer to find a cure for this devastating disease that affects the most complex organ of the universe.}

The model parameters are determined using a set of experimental measurements corresponding to different constant current values and the resulting model is validated on the data measured for variable current. Based on this model a semi-active control of vehicle suspension is studied and a fuzzy controller is developed to reduce the chattering effect.}

abstract = {In recent years, the government has actively set up computer programming courses to train those with the relevant talent; however, the learning performance of the students is not ideal. Therefore, in order to learn programming skills, students usually adopt note-taking strategies because, due to the pressure of the course, the teachers do not have sufficient time to help the students to fully understand the course content. This means that some students take notes without thinking, so their academic performance is usually poor. This study, therefore, proposes an innovative curriculum design that is based on the “Note-taking System and Teaching Strategy’’ (NSTS), which combines learning style concepts and peer learning concepts to achieve student interaction and promote their thinking skills. In the learning activity, students are asked to search for additional supplementary material and to write their own notes, and then the members of group can read their notes and learn from them. However, the results of the study show that the NSTS curriculum design exhibits significant differences for improving the students’ academic performance, and that it also has a certain influence on their learning motivation.}

However, financial ability is the most significant factor in the evolution from preventive to enthusiastic environmental behavior, followed by managers’ environmental awareness and community support. Our identification of the most important factors can serve as a basis for decision makers to focus on improving the operational effectiveness of environmental policies.}

Conventional, DAMAS, and CLEAN-SC array processing is applied in an identical fashion to the experimental and computational results for three different configurations involving deploying and retracting the main landing gear and a part-span flap. Despite the short time records of the numerical signals, the beamform maps are able to isolate the noise sources, and the appearance of the DAMAS synthetic array maps is generally better than those from the experimental data. The experimental CLEAN-SC maps are similar in quality to those from the simulations indicating that CLEAN-SC may have less sensitivity to background noise. The spectrum obtained from DAMAS processing of synthetic array data is nearly identical to the spectrum of the center microphone of the array, indicating that for this problem array processing of synthetic data does not improve spectral comparisons with experiment. However, the beamform maps do provide an additional means of comparison that can reveal differences that cannot be ascertained from spectra alone.}

As methodologies for ‘practice as research’ (PaR) in theatre and performance have developed since the 1990s, artistic researchers have often continued to define themselves against scientific conceptions of thinking, knowledge, and research to highlight the specific efficacies of artistic practice. I argue that this strategy genuinely hinders researchers, and that interdisciplinary approaches that move across the sciences, humanities, and arts are the key to robust accounts of theatre and performance. By revisiting a seminal PaR performance project, Joanne ‘Bob’ Whalley and Lee Miller’s Partly Cloudy, Chance of Rain (2002), I suggest how interdisciplinary approaches such as enaction from the cognitive sciences should be integrated into PaR methodologies to better address the complexity and richness of embodiment and emergence in theatre and performance.}

Cone models with fixed base diameter (and hence fixed blockage ratio) are selected for this study. Cone half-angles from 15° to 75° are examined to ascertain the effect of the strength of the test model shock wave on the tunnel startup. The unsteady, laminar, compressible Navier—Stokes equations are solved. The resulting flowfields are examined to see what affect the shocks and shear layers would have on the quiet test section flow. This study indicates that cone angles ≤20° allow the tunnel to start.}

abstract = {Developing a profound understanding of the combustion characteristics of the cold-start phase of a Direct Injection Spark Ignition (DISI) engine is critical to meeting increasingly stringent emissions regulations. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling of gasoline DISI combustion under normal operating conditions has been discussed in detail using both the detailed chemistry approach and flamelet models (e.g. the G-Equation). However, there has been little discussion regarding the capability of the existing models to capture DISI combustion under cold-start conditions. Accurate predictions of cold-start behavior involves the efficient use of multiple models - spray modeling to capture the split injection strategies, models to capture the wall-film interactions, ignition modeling to capture the effects of retarded spark timings, combustion modeling to accurately capture the flame front propagation, and turbulence modeling to capture the effects of decaying turbulent kinetic energy. The retarded spark timing helps to generate high heat flux in the exhaust for the faster catalyst light-off during cold-start. However, the adverse effect is a reduced turbulent flame speed due to decaying turbulent kinetic energy. Accordingly, developing an understanding of the turbulence-chemistry interactions is imperative for accurate modeling of combustion under cold-start conditions. In the present work, combustion characteristics during the cold-start, fast-idle phase is modeled using the G-Equation flamelet model and the RANS turbulence model. The challenges associated with capturing the turbulent-chemistry interactions are explained by tracking the flame front travel along the Borghi-Peters regime diagram. In this study, a modified version of the G-Equation combustion model for capturing cold-start flame travel is presented.}

Stenting of the LMCA has emerged as a valid alternative in place of traditional coronary bypass graft surgery. However, in case of mid-shaft/distal lesion, there is no consensus regarding the extension of the strut coverage up to the ostium or to stent only the culprit lesion. Methods We reconstructed a left main-left descending coronary artery (LM-LCA)-left circumflex (LCX) bifurcation after analysing 100 consecutive patients (mean age 71.4 ± 9.3, 49 males) with LM mid-shaft/distal disease. The mean diameter of proximal LM, left anterior descending (LAD) and LCX, evaluated with quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) was 4.62 ± 0.86 mm, 3.31 ± 0.92 mm, and 2.74 ± 0.93 mm, respectively. For the stent simulation, a third-generation, everolimus-eluting stent was virtually reconstructed. Results After virtual stenting, the net area averaged wall shear stress (WSS) of the model and the WSS at the LCA-LCX bifurcation resulted higher when the stent covered the culprit mid-shaft lesion only compared with the extension of the stent covering the ostium (3.68 versus 2.06 Pa, p = 0.01 and 3.97 versus 1.98 Pa, p < 0.001, respectively. Similarly, the static pressure and the Reynolds number were significantly higher after stent implantation covering up the ostium. At the ostium, the flow resulted more laminar when stenting only the mid-shaft lesion than including the ostium. Conclusions Although these findings cannot be translated directly into real practice our brief study suggests that stenting lesion 1:1 or extending the stent to cover the LM ostium impacts differently the rheolytic properties of LMCA bifurcation with potential insights for restenosis or thrombosis.}
