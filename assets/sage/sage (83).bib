abstract = {The metastable dissociations of a series of simple inorganic gaseous ions of general formula (H,F,M)+, including NF3H+ (M = NF2), N2F2H+ (M = FN2), F2NOH2+ (M = FNOH) and FNOH+ (M = NO) have been investigated using classical dynamics in order to rationalise their mass-analysed ion kinetic energy (MIKE) spectra which, from earlier experimental studies, showed the systematic loss of neutral hydrofluoric acid, HF, accompanied by a fairly large release of translational energy (T). All the simulations were initiated in correspondence of the transition structures involved in the above decompositions and expanded on the related Hartree–Fock potential energy surfaces, calculated “on the fly” during the evolution of the trajectories according to the Dynamic Reaction Path methodology. The initial associated momenta were deduced by performing a standard kinetic analysis of the above dissociations taking into account the specific features of the MIKE experiments. For all the above ions, the resulting computed Ts are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values. In addition, from a more accurate analysis of the trajectories, it could be possible to appreciate qualitatively both the specific role of the internal degrees of freedom of the decomposing ions and the dynamic and energetic influence of the HF–M+ ion–neutral complex located between the dissociation products and the tight transition structure involved in the above decompositions.}

abstract = {Heart failure is a major health risk, and with limited availability of donor organs, there is an increasing need for developing cardiac assist devices (CADs). Mock circulatory loops (MCL) are an important in-vitro test platform for CAD’s performance assessment and optimisation. The MCL is a lumped parameter model constructed out of hydraulic and mechanical components aiming to simulate the native cardiovascular system (CVS) as closely as possible. Further development merged MCLs and numerical circulatory models to improve flexibility and accuracy of the system; commonly known as hybrid MCLs. A total of 128 MCLs were identified in a literature research until 25 September 2020. It was found that the complexity of the MCLs rose over the years, recent MCLs are not only capable of mimicking the healthy and pathological conditions, but also implemented cerebral, renal and coronary circulations and autoregulatory responses. Moreover, the development of anatomical models made flow visualisation studies possible. Mechanical MCLs showed excellent controllability and repeatability, however, often the CVS was overly simplified or lacked autoregulatory responses. In numerical MCLs the CVS is represented with a higher order of lumped parameters compared to mechanical test rigs, however, complex physiological aspects are often simplified. In hybrid MCLs complex physiological aspects are implemented in the hydraulic part of the system, whilst the numerical model represents parts of the CVS that are too difficult to represent by mechanical components per se. This review aims to describe the advances, limitations and future directions of the three types of MCLs.}

I argue that the IO constructed policy knowledge that reified discourses of “digital meritocracy”: a belief in digital technologies as a means of evaluating individual success, regardless of historic, place-based material inequities. To develop this concept, I trace themes of “personalization” and “everywhere” as they emerge in the IO’s daily work and in federal education technology policies. This study extends research on IOs as “brokers” of information, resources, and social ties between public schools and private service providers and argues that IOs also construct “policy knowledge,” or “definitions of what counts as education.”}

abstract = {Ceramic-on-ceramic hip resurfacing can potentially offer the bone-conserving advantages of resurfacing while eliminating metal ion release. Thin-walled ceramic resurfacing heads are conceivable following developments in the strength and reliability of ceramic materials, but verification of new designs is required. The present study aimed to develop a mechanical pre-clinical analysis verification process for ceramic resurfacing heads, using the DeltaSurf prosthesis design as a case study. Finite element analysis of a range of in vivo scenarios was used to design a series of physiologically representative mechanical tests, which were conducted to verify the strength of the prosthesis. Tests were designed to simulate ideal and worst-case in vivo loading and support, or to allow comparison with a clinically successful metallic device. In tests simulating ideal loading and support, the prosthesis sustained a minimum load of 39 kN before fracture, and survived 10 000 000 fatigue cycles of 0.534 kN to 5.34 kN. In worst-case tests representing a complete lack of superior femoral head bone support or pure cantilever loading of the prosthesis stem, the design demonstrated strength comparable to that of the equivalent metal device. The developed mechanical verification test programme represents an improvement in the state of the art where international test standards refer largely to total hip replacement prostheses. The case study’s novel prosthesis design performed with considerable safety margins compared with extreme in vivo loads, providing evidence that the proposed ceramic resurfacing heads should have sufficient strength to perform safely in vivo. Similar verification tests should be designed and conducted for novel ceramic prosthesis designs in the future, leading the way to clinical evaluation.}

abstract = {Distal femoral fractures associated with the femoral stem in a well-fixed hip arthroplasty pose a risk of an interprosthetic fracture, the treatment of which is known as difficult. To effectively prevent and treat IP fractures, biomechanical effects must be demonstrated. We defined eight variations of the interprosthetic distance ranging from 48 mm overlap to 128 mm gap. Femoral geometries with normal and reduced cortical thickness were modeled to evaluate the effects of cortical thickness. In addition to the intact model, a total of 16 finite element models were analyzed under physiological boundary conditions. Maximum and minimum principal strains on the lateral and medial cortex surfaces were always found to be greater in models with reduced cortical thickness than in normal femurs. The model with 48 mm overlapping interprosthetic distance produced the least peak strain and the model with 16 mm interprosthetic gap produced the greatest strain with both normal and reduced cortical thickness. The screw holes produced local strain concentrations and increased the peak strains on the cortex surfaces, especially close to the stem tip. Statistically, a significant correlation (R2 = 0.9483) was found between strain shielding and interprosthetic distance. Axial stiffness, interfragmentary shear motion, and maximum von-Mises stress on the distal plate showed a high correlation with the interprosthetic distance. It was concluded that the overlapping structures are superior to other fixations we analyzed in that they offer better mechanical stability and eliminates the local strain concentrations.}

abstract = {In gas turbines, rim seals are fitted at the periphery of the wheel-space between the turbine disc and its adjacent casing; their purpose is to reduce the ingress of hot mainstream gases. This paper describes the use of a three-dimensional, steady-state model to investigate ingress through engine-representative single and double radial-clearance seals. The three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computations of a simplified turbine stage are carried out using the commercial computational fluid dynamics code ANSYS CFX v13, and the model is based on the geometry of an experimental test rig at the University of Bath. The measured variation of the peak-to-trough pressure difference in the annulus, which is the main driving mechanism for ingress, is reproduced well qualitatively by the computations; quantitatively, the maximum local differences between computation and experiment are less than 20% of the measured peak-to-trough circumferential variation. The radial variation of swirl ratio in the rotor–stator wheel-space is well predicted over the range of flow rates and rim seal geometries studied. The radial distribution of sealing effectiveness determined from experiments is reproduced inward of the mixing region near the seal clearance over a range of sealing flow rates; some over-prediction of the effectiveness was found for both seals at high radius, probably due to limitations in the turbulent mixing modelling. The three-dimensional steady-state approach may be a practical tool for the engine designer where there is a lack of experimental data, providing quantitative predictions of the flow structure within the rotor–stator wheel-space and qualitative predictions of the sealing effectiveness for a given rim seal geometry.}

In this study, the combined effects of bearing surface texturing and non-Newtonian lubricants behavior, using micropolar fluid model, on static characteristics of hydrodynamic circular journal bearings of finite length are highlighted. The modified Reynolds equation of micropolar lubrication theory is solved using finite differences scheme and Elrod’s mass conservation algorithm, taking into account the presence of the cylindrical texture shape on full and optimum bearing surfaces. The optimization textured area is carried out through particle swarm optimization algorithm, in order to increase the load lifting capacity. Preliminary results are in good agreement with the reference ones, and present an enhancement in the performances of micro-textured journal bearings (load carrying capacity and friction). The results suggest that texturing the bearing convergent zone significantly increases the load carrying capacity and reduce friction coefficient, while fully texturing causes bad performances. It is also shown that the micropolar fluids exhibit better performances for smooth journal bearings than a Newtonian fluid depending on the size of material characteristic length and the coupling number. The combined effects of fully surface textured with micropolar fluids reduce the performance of journal bearing, especially at lower eccentricity ratios. Considering the optimal arrangement of textures on the contact surface, a significant improvement in terms of load capacity and friction can be achieved, particularly at high eccentricity ratios, high material characteristic lengths and high values of the coupling numbers of micropolar fluids.}

Based on a content analysis of articles on AI published in two magazines, the Scientific American and the New Scientist, which were aimed at a broad readership of scientists, engineers and technologists, three dominant patterns in the construction of the AI myth are identified: (1) the recurrence of analogies and discursive shifts, by which ideas and concepts from other fields were employed to describe the functioning of AI technologies; (2) a rhetorical use of the future, imagining that present shortcomings and limitations will shortly be overcome and (3) the relevance of controversies around the claims of AI, which we argue should be considered as an integral part of the discourse surrounding the AI myth.}

This arrangement is generally recognized as the worst-case scenario for the downwind rotor considering the vortices and disorders produced by the upwind rotor. The rotor in question with the diameter of 2.5 m is made up of three NACA0015 blades with the chord length and span size equal to 0.4 and 3 m, respectively. Based on the authors’ previous works, the shear stress transport model was selected for this comparative study. According to the results, there is an appreciable deviation in the aerodynamic performance of the upwind rotor predicted by the two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulation techniques. There is no tangible difference between the two-dimensional and three-dimensional results in terms of the averaged power output for the downwind rotor. However, the study of flow field employing different means like vortex structures, axial velocity, and even torque variation indicates that the two-dimensional approach is unable to achieve realistic and reliable output data. The introduced “pillar effect” regarding the dimensional limitations of the two-dimensional approach, which affects the vorticity shape and its dissipation, is plausible evidence for this discrepancy.}

abstract = {Diphyllin-7′-O-β-D-glucoside, a podophyllotoxin derivative, was isolated from the roots of Dysosma versipellis. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra acquired at 300 K exhibited doubling of signals, suggesting the existence of two rotamers in solution. Variable-temperature 1H NMR experiments indicated a dynamic exchange process between the two rotamers. DFT calculations verified nearly equal energies for the two rotamers about the single bond C7′-O7.}
