The Modifiable Multitasking Environment (ModME) offers a flexible, browser-based platform for creating multitasking experiments. Simplified Interfacing for Modeling Cognition–JavaScript (SIMCog-JS) provides communication between the browser-based experiments in ModME and the Java implementation of the ACT-R cognitive architecture. The baseline configuration of these software packages enables an ACT-R model to perform pilot-like multitasking in the modified Multi-Attribute Task Battery, which is implemented as the baseline task available in ModME. We show how this combination facilitates the development of models for assessing multitasking workload.

The development of NetSolve was motivated by the need for an easy-to-use, efficient mechanism for using compu tational resources remotely. Ease of use is obtained as a result of different interfaces, some of which require no programming effort from the user. Good performance is ensured by a load-balancing policy that enables NetSolve to use the computational resources available as efficiently as possible. NetSolve offers the ability to look for compu tational resources on a network, choose the best one available, solve a problem (with retry for fault tolerance), and return the answer to the user.}

abstract = {Background Maxillary antrostomy is commonly performed during endoscopic sinus surgery. Little is known about the association surrounding recalcitrant maxillary sinusitis, antrostomy size, and intranasal airflow changes. Furthermore, the interaction between sinus mucosa and airflow is poorly understood. This study used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling to investigate postoperative airflow characteristics between diseased and nondiseased maxillary sinuses in subjects with recurrent disease. Methods A retrospective review of patients from a tertiary-level academic rhinology practice was performed. Seven subjects with endoscopic evidence of postoperative maxillary sinus disease that presented as chronic unilateral crusting at least 1 year after bilateral maxillary antrostomies were selected. A three-dimensional model of each subject’s sinonasal cavity was created from postoperative computed tomographies and used for CFD analysis. Results Although the variables investigated between diseased and nondiseased sides were not statistically significant, the diseased side in six subjects had a smaller antrostomy, and five of these subjects had both reduced nasal unilateral airflow and increased unilateral nasal resistance on the diseased side. The ratio of posterior wall shear stress (WSS) of the maxillary sinus to the total WSS was higher on the diseased side in six subjects. Results also showed strong correlations between antrostomy and CFD variables on the diseased side than on the nondiseased side. Conclusion This pilot study showed that the majority of the simulated sinonasal models exhibited common characteristics on the side with persistent disease, such as smaller antrostomy, reduced nasal airflow, increased nasal resistance, and increased posterior WSS. Although statistical significance was not established, this study provided preliminary insight into variables to consider in a larger cohort study.}

abstract = {Hydraulic conductivity (k) is critical for designing permeable pavements for safety and environmental reasons. A novel approach for estimating k is through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applied to permeable asphalt (PA). Specimens of PA are examined in this study to evaluate CFD applicability. Tortuosity, effective porosity, pore size distribution, and specific surface area were determined based on three-dimensional specimen structures reconstructed using x-ray tomography analyses. Using CFD, estimates of k were determined and compared with physical measurements and also with the results obtained from the semi-empirical modified Kozeny-Carman model (KCM). The comparison shows that the numerical simulations with CFD can be a reasonable tool for estimating k and for examining transport of water through PA. Within the constraints of this study, results infer that CFD can provide more representative results for low k in comparison with KCM. For higher k, CFD and KCM results were reasonably comparable.}

In particular, collaboration with robots presents unique challenges related to the preservation of human situational awareness and the optimization of workload allocation for human teammates while respecting their workflow preferences. We conducted a series of human subject experiments to investigate these human factors, and provide design guidelines for the development of intelligent collaborative robots based on our results.}

abstract = {Determining and understanding the performance characteristics of marine propellers by experiments is quite a complex and costly task. Numerical predictions using computational fluid dynamics simulations could be a valuable alternative provided that the laminar-to-turbulent transition flow effects are fundamentally understood with the suitable numerical models developed. Experience suggests that the use of classical turbulent flow models may lead to high discrepancies especially at low rotational speeds where the effects of fluid flow transition from the laminar to the turbulent state may influence the predicted propeller’s performance. This article proposes a complete and detailed procedure for the computational fluid dynamics simulation of non-cavitating flow over marine propellers using the “k–kl–ω” transition-sensitive turbulence model. Results are evaluated by “ANSYS FLUENT 16” for the “INSEAN E779A” propeller. Comparisons against the fully turbulent standard “k–ε” model and against experiments show improved agreement in way of flow transition zones at lower rotational speeds, that is, at low Reynolds numbers.}

abstract = {The effects of hydrogen addition to internal combustion engines operated by natural gas/methane has been widely demonstrated experimentally in the literature. Already small hydrogen contents in the fuel show promising benefits with respect to increased engine efficiency, lower CO2 emissions, extended lean operating limits and a higher exhaust gas recirculation tolerance while maintaining the knock resistance of methane. In this article, the influence of hydrogen addition to methane on a spark ignited single cylinder engine is investigated. This article proposes a modelling approach to consider hydrogen addition within three-dimensional reactive computational fluid dynamics in order to establish a framework to gain further insights into the involved processes. Experiments have been performed on a single-cylinder spark-ignition engine situated at a test bed and cater as reference data for validating the proposed reactive computational fluid dynamics modelling approach based around the G-Equation combustion model. Within the course of the first part, crucial aspects relevant to the modelling of the mean engine cycle are highlighted. In this article, a simplified early combustion phase model which considers the transition towards a fully developed turbulent flame following ignition is introduced, along with a second submodel considering combined effects of the walls. The sensitivity of the combustion process towards the modelling approach is presented. The submodels were calibrated for a reference operating point, and a sweep in hydrogen content in the fuel as well as stoichiometric and lean operation has been considered. It is shown that the flame speed coefficient A appearing in the used turbulent flame speed closure, weighting the influence of the turbulent fluctuating speed , has to be adjusted for different hydrogen contents. The introduced submodels allowed for significant improvement of the in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate evolution throughout all considered operating conditions.}

abstract = {Introduction: The volume of blood flowing through the vascular access is an important parameter necessary to provide adequate dialysis for a functional arteriovenous fistula. Higher blood flows are seen in arteriovenous access that receive inflow from larger arteries such as brachial or axillary compared to those based on medium-caliber radial or ulnar arteries. We hypothesized that an anatomic difference in the length and the diameter of the artery is an important determinant of the flow volume in arteriovenous fistula created at different anatomic locations. Methods: Using computational fluid dynamics, we evaluated the contribution of the length and diameter of inflow artery on simulations performed with geometric models constructed to represent arteriovenous fistula circuits. Lengths and diameters of the inflow artery were altered to mimic arteriovenous fistula created at various locations of the upper extremity with standard and variant anatomy. Results: Models of arteriovenous fistula created with variable lengths and diameters of the inflow artery suggest that the length of the vessel has an inverse linear relationship and the diameter has a direct linear relationship to flow volume. Conclusion: Computational fluid dynamic modeling of arteriovenous fistula can be used to understand the physiologic basis of clinical observations of function. Evaluation of the effect of inflow artery length and diameter helps explain the higher flows seen in arteriovenous fistula created using large caliber arteries for inflow. Computational fluid dynamic modeling helps operators understand the contributions of inflow artery in access function and can guide anastomotic site selection.}

abstract = {Objective: Set-inversion-based prandial insulin delivery is a new model-based bolus advisor for postprandial glucose control in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). It automatically coordinates the values of basal-bolus insulin to be infused during the postprandial period so as to achieve some predefined control objectives. However, the method requires an excessive computation time to compute the solution set of feasible insulin profiles, which impedes its integration into an insulin pump. In this work, a new algorithm is presented, which reduces computation time significantly and enables the integration of this new bolus advisor into current processing features of smart insulin pumps. Methods: A new strategy was implemented that focused on finding the combined basal-bolus solution of interest rather than an extensive search of the feasible set of solutions. Analysis of interval simulations, inclusion of physiological assumptions, and search domain contractions were used. Data from six real patients with T1DM were used to compare the performance between the optimized and the conventional computations. Results: In all cases, the optimized version yielded the basal-bolus combination recommended by the conventional method and in only 0.032% of the computation time. Simulations show that the mean number of iterations for the optimized computation requires approximately 3.59 s at 20 MHz processing power, in line with current features of smart pumps. Conclusions: A computationally efficient method for basal-bolus coordination in postprandial glucose control has been presented and tested. The results indicate that an embedded algorithm within smart insulin pumps is now feasible. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that a clinical trial will be needed in order to justify this claim.}

abstract = {Understanding the manoeuvring performance of a ship requires accurate predictions of the hydrodynamic forces and moments on the ship. In the present study, the hydrodynamic forces and moments on a manoeuvring container ship at various rudder and drift angles are numerically predicted by solving the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. The effects of dynamic sinkage and trim on the hydrodynamic forces are first investigated together with a grid dependency study to estimate the numerical error and uncertainty caused by grid discretization, and with a validation study combining the experimental data. The results show that the effect of dynamic sinkage and trim is non-negligible, since including it improves the hydrodynamic force predictions and reduces the numerical error and uncertainty, and the averaged error and uncertainty are smaller than the other computational fluid dynamics results where sinkage and trim were fixed with given values from model tests. Therefore, it is included in the subsequent systematic simulations regarding the influence of rudder and drift angles. The computed forces, moments and rudder coefficients at different rudder and drift angles on the container ship are compared with the benchmark model test data. From the computations, all the predicted quantities are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental data. The details of the flow filed and hydrodynamic forces, such as pressure distributions, transverse force distributions along the hull, velocity contours, streamlines and wave patterns are presented and discussed, and a deep insight into the physical mechanism in the hydrodynamic forces on a manoeuvring ship is obtained.}

In this procedure, an integration of the short-term and long-term mechanical processes of track deterioration is taken into account, using a track degradation model. This degradation model is incorporated into a finite element code where two modes of calculation are implemented: the “implicit mode” concerns the short-term track deterioration, in which the hypoplastic model is used for the ballast layer and the dynamic response to an instantaneous train axle passage is obtained to serve as input data for the “explicit mode”, which concerns the simulation of long-term track deterioration, using the accumulation model for ballast layer. The whole procedure is illustrated on the prediction of the ballasted track profile degradation of a track section of 100 m. The results show a significant influence of the type of track geometry defects and the vehicle velocity on the evolution of track deterioration and the capability of the proposed procedure in reproducing the track profile degradation.}

The simulation results provide insight into the temperature and flow fields for the configuration at hand, revealing an entrainment effect. The influence of the water spray characteristics on the downward smoke displacement due to drag and cooling is explained. Furthermore, an extensive sensitivity study of the simulation results to input parameters and mesh size is performed.

abstract = {This paper presents experimentally validated three-dimensional transient simulations of the thermal phenomena of the tape winding process, as well as a method to determine separately the heat transfer between the hot gas originating from a torch and the composite material. The computational model predicts the temperature of the incoming tape and the substrate during the winding process. Each numerical simulation is based on an explicit time integration scheme and covers the duration of the process. The simulation within each time step employs a steady-state model. This method takes into account the cyclic nonuniform heating of the material and the effect of the growing mass. The comparison of the simulation results with the experimental data shows good agreements. The experiments were performed with preconsolidated glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene tapes. The measurements were performed with infrared pyrometry. This technique can handle moving points during the entire process, and is nonintrusive.}

abstract = {For large-scale wireless sensor networks, the nonlinear localization problem where only neighboring distances are available to each individual sensor nodes have been attracting great research attention. In general, distributed algorithms for this problem are likely to suffer from the failures that localizations are trapped in local minima. Focusing on this issue, this article considers a fully distributed algorithm by introducing a novel mechanism, where each individual node is allowed to computationally interact with a random subset of its neighbors, for helping localizations escape from local minima. Theoretical analyses reveal that with the proposed algorithm, any local minimum of the localization will be unstable, and the global optimum would finally be achieved with probability 1 after enough time of iterations. Numerical simulations are given as well to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.}
