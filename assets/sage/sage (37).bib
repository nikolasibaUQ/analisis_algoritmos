abstract = {For industries using multi-phase transportation pipelines, erosion has been identified as one of the main challenges. Thus, extensive experimental and computational studies on slurry erosion wear have been conducted already for smooth pipes, particularly bends and junctions which were more susceptible to erosion wear because of the flow of multi-phase, but findings of erosive wear rate on the unbounded flexible pipe are not yet established. The purpose of the current study is to examine the effects of slurry wear on the unbounded flexible pipe material using CFD analysis when multi-phase fluid is flowing in the UFP at different curvature angles (30°, 50°, 70°, 90°). Flow speed (2 ms−1, 4 ms−1, 6 ms−1, 8 ms−1, 10 ms−1) and concentration (5%, 10%, 15%) were the key variables taken into account, and is discovered that these characteristics had a substantial effect on the flexible pipe. Further, to analyze how particle collision tendency affects the erosion wear rate of UPF when compared to smooth pipe, the streamlines for the UFP and smooth pipe are extracted.}

abstract = {Background: Midvault reconstruction is an essential element of functional rhinoplasty. An improved understanding of airflow patterns after spreader graft (SG) or spreader flap (SF) techniques can inform surgical techniques based on individual anatomy. Objectives: The objective of this study was to compare the physiologic changes related to nasal function after midvault reconstruction with SF and SG. Methods: Soft tissue elevation (STE), SG, and SF were performed in sequence on 5 cadaveric specimens. Computational modeling was used to simulate airflow, heat transfer, and humidity in three-dimensional nasal airway reconstructions of each specimen. Results: Median bilateral airflow-rates (L/min) were similar for STE (29.4), SF (27.6), and SG (28.9), and were not statistically significant (STE vs SF: P = 1.0, power = 5%; STE vs SG: P = .31, power = 16%; SF vs SG: P = .42, power = 14%). Both SF and SG had increased unilateral airflow volume (L/min) through the more obstructed nasal passage (median: STE 10.3, SF 12.2, SG 12.7), but these differences were not significant (STE vs SF: P = .19, power = 24%; STE vs SG P = .19, power = 30%). Furthermore, SF and SG had decreased unilateral nasal resistance (Pa s/mL) on the more obstructed side (median: STE 0.085, SF 0.072, SG 0.062) (STE vs SF: P = .13, power = 23%; STE vs SG P = .13, power = 24%). For all 3 models, heat flux distribution was greater in the anterior portion of the nasal passage than the posterior portions. Conclusions: Differences in nasal airflow and resistance after SF and SG were not statistically significant, but both procedures resulted in higher airflow rates and decreased nasal resistance through the more obstructed nasal passage.}

abstract = {Abstract Are we close to a complete inventory of living processes so that we might expect in the near future to reproduce every essential aspect necessary for life? Or are there mechanisms and processes in cells and organisms that are presently inaccessible to us? Here I argue that a close examination of a particularly well-understood system— that of Escherichia coli chemotaxis— shows we are still a long way from a complete description. There is a level of molecular uncertainty, particularly that responsible for fine-tuning and adaptation to myriad external conditions, which we presently cannot resolve or reproduce on a computer. Moreover, the same uncertainty exists for any process in any organism and is especially pronounced and important in higher animals such as humans. Embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, immune recognition, memory formation, and survival in the real world, all depend on vast numbers of subtle variations in cell chemistry most of which are presently unknown or only poorly characterized. Overcoming these limitations will require us to not only accumulate large quantities of highly detailed data but also develop new computational methods able to recapitulate the massively parallel processing of living cells.}

abstract = {Recent experimental evidence indicates that animals can use mental simulation to make decisions about the actions to take during goal-directed navigation. The principal brain areas found to be active during this process are the hippocampus, the ventral striatum and the sensory-motor cortex. In this paper, we present a computational model that includes biological aspects of this circuit and explains mechanistically how it may be used to imagine and evaluate future events. Its most salient characteristic is that choices about actions are made by simulating movements and their sensory effects using the same brain areas that are active during overt execution. More precisely, the simulation of an action (e.g., walking) creates a new sensory pattern that is evaluated in the same way as real inputs. The model is validated in a navigation task in which a simulated rat is placed in a complex maze. We show that hippocampal and striatal cells are activated to simulate paths, to retrieve their estimated value and to make decisions. We link these results with a general framework that sees the brain as a predictive device that can ‘detach’ itself from the here-and-now of current perception using mechanisms such as episodic memories, motor and visual imagery.}

abstract = {Previous studies on inter-unit dispersion around multi-storey buildings focused mostly on an isolated building. Considering that the presence of an upstream building(s) would significantly modify the airflow pattern around a downstream building, this study intends to investigate the influence of such changed airflow patterns on inter-unit dispersion characteristics around a multi-storey building due to wind effect. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method in the framework of Reynolds-averaged Navier-stokes modelling was employed to predict the coupled outdoor and indoor airflow field, and the tracer gas technique was used to simulate the dispersion of infectious agents between units. Based on the predicted concentration field, a mass conservation based parameter, namely re-entry ratio, was used to evaluate quantitatively the inter-unit dispersion possibilities and thus assess risks along different routes. The presence of upstream building(s) could disrupt the strong impingement of approaching flows but brings a more complex and irregular airflow pattern around the downstream multi-storey buildings, leading to a more scattered distribution of re-entry ratio values among different units and uncertain dispersion routes. Generally, the tracer gas concentration in most units was lower than those in an isolated building, although very high concentrations were found in some specific areas.}

abstract = {Different geometry patterns of the surface of thrust bearings have been proven very beneficial in terms of bearing load-carrying capacity and friction coefficient. In this study, four different types of sector-pad thrust bearings have been cross-evaluated for operation under realistic operating conditions: (a) an open pocket bearing, (b) a closed pocket bearing, (c) a tapered-land bearing, and (d) a bearing partially textured with rectangular dimples. Bearing performance has been computed by means of computational fluid dynamics simulations based on the numerical solution of the Navier–Stokes and energy equations for incompressible flow. Conjugate heat transfer at the bearing pad and rotor has been taken into account. Initially, for a reference design of each bearing, the effects of varying rotational speed and minimum film thickness have been investigated. Further, characterization of each bearing for a constant level of thrust load has been performed. Finally, the effects of varying the depth of each geometry pattern have been studied. The present results illustrate a superior performance of the open pocket bearing in comparison to the other bearing types.}

abstract = {The prefix meta is popular in psychology as well as in other sciences oriented on the investigation of psychology. In the first case the usage is quite simple: every term is “the sum” of meta and usual psychological concept. In the second case, the situation is much more complicated. Sometimes, it is related to transition on a higher level of abstraction, from first-order to second-order investigations. Why is such a transition necessary and is it useful for scientific progress? The comparative analysis of the meta-approach to different sciences shows both specific peculiarities (reasons for application of the prefix, methods of manipulation and investigation, main objects of analysis, goals raised, and status of metaresearcher) and common features and regularities that may be discovered only in an interdisciplinary context. In this special section, we suggest a new way of application of meta-approach to psychology—in terms of metathinking. Our main idea is as follows: The wide circulation of meta-approach to psychology with necessity leads to serious changes in thinking of both researchers in the field of psychology and in sciences oriented on investigation of psychology.}

The proposed solution procedure is second order accurate in space and employs a second-order accurate dual time-stepping scheme. The momentum conservation equations are written in terms of the Piola-Kirchhoff stresses. The stress tensor is related to the Lagrangian strain tensor through the St. Venant-Kirchhoff constitutive relationship. The structural solver presented is verified through two test cases. The first test case is a three-dimensional cantilever beam subject to a gravitational load that is verified using theory and two-dimensional simulations reported in literature. The second test case is a three-dimensional highly deformable cantilever plate subject to a gravitational load. The results of this case are verified through a comparison with the modal response calculated by commercially available software. The focus of the current effort is the development and verification of the structural dynamics portion of a future fully coupled monolithic fluid-thermal-structure interaction code package.}

abstract = {The extent of inter-material mixing and the formation of intermetallic compounds play a critical role in the structural integrity and mechanical properties of the joints in the case of dissimilar metal friction stir welding. In general, there is a critical volume fraction of the intermetallic compounds in the mix zone of the friction stir welding-joint at which the mechanical properties of the joint are maximized. That is, insufficient inter-material mixing and the accompanying sub-critical volume fraction of the intermetallic compounds results in insufficient inter-material bonding and inferior joint strength. Conversely, super-critical volume fraction of the intermetallic compounds typically gives rise to the joint embrittlement. To address the problem of the effect of the friction stir welding process parameters on the extent of intermetallic compound formation, a multi-physics computational framework has been developed and applied to the case of dissimilar metal friction stir welding involving commercially pure (CP) aluminum and AISI 1005 low-carbon steel. The multi-physics framework comprises the following main modules: (a) finite-element-based friction stir welding-process modeling; (b) quantum-mechanics, atomistic and CALPHAD-type continuum material thermodynamics analyses of the intermetallic compound-nucleation process; (c) a continuum-type analysis of multi-component diffusion-controlled growth of the intermetallic compounds; and (d) Kolmogorov–Johnson–Mehl–Avrami type analysis of the evolution of the intermetallic compound volume fraction within the friction stir welding joint as a function of the friction stir welding process parameters. The results obtained revealed that: (i) the extent and the spatial distribution of the intermetallic compounds is a sensitive function of the friction stir welding-process parameters; and (ii) among the six potential Al-Fe intermetallic compounds, FeAl and Fe3Al are associated with the largest volume fractions and, hence, play a key role in both attaining the required joint strength and in the potential loss of the joint fracture toughness.}

Instruction on evidence evaluation in postsecondary education often focuses on peer-review as a singular indicator of credibility.

This study describes the integration of sInvestigator, a computational evidence-based scientific reasoning tool, with a class of 32 students in an undergraduate honors course focused on socio-scientific issues. A cross-disciplinary team of researchers with expertise in science education, scientific literacy, and evidence evaluation developed and implemented an online questionnaire to measure students’ development of digital scientific literacy. After using sInvestigator to evaluate sources of scientific evidence based on publisher reputation, author competence, and author objectivity, students were better able to assess the credibility of online information. Results of this study also confirm the potential to authentically assess students’ use of author and publisher information to evaluate digital scientific sources. The need for further research on the operationalization and measurement of digital scientific literacy is discussed.}

abstract = {The wind flow field constitutes an important input parameter for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations that are used in architectural design for the design and analysis of natural ventilation strategies.  Despite indications that the wind flow field may vary between places, CFD simulations that do not adequately account for this potential variation are still commonplace. This may significantly compromise the integrity and accuracy of the CFD simulations. This study was a two-pronged investigation with the ultimate objective of contributing towards efforts aimed at improving the accuracy of the CFD simulations. Firstly, a framework for integrated meso-scale and micro-scale CFD simulations was developed. Secondly, the newly developed framework was then implemented by deploying it to study the variation of the wind flow field between a reference meteorological station, and a selected local building site. The findings confirmed the indications that the wind flow field might vary spatially. The integrated multi-scale framework that was developed as part of the study was not only able to capture the wind flow field variation, but it also provided a way to quantify it, ultimately, leading to the generation of a more accurate wind flow field characterization representative of the local conditions. Through its ability to integrate multiple spatial scales that typically influence one another, this framework can help to enhance the accuracy and integrity of the CFD simulations that are used for natural ventilation design. Practical application: The findings from this study can be particularly useful when undertaking spatially integrated CFD simulations to design and analyse natural ventilation strategies in the building design process.}

abstract = {This paper reviews recent developments by the Washington/Brown groups for the study of anatomical shape in the emerging new discipline of computational anatomy. Parametric representations of anatomical variation for computational anatomy are reviewed, restricted to the assumption of small deformations. The generation of covariance operators for probabilistic measures of anatomical variation on coordinatized submanifolds is formulated as an empirical procedure. Populations of brains are mapped to common coordinate systems, from which template coordinate systems are constructed which are closest to the population of anatomies in a minimum distance sense. Variation of several one-, two and three-dimensional manifolds, i.e. sulci, surfaces and brain volumes are examined via Gaussian measures with mean and covariances estimated directly from maps of templates to targets. Methods are presented for estimating the covariances of vector fields from a family of empirically generated maps, posed as generalized spectrum estimation indexed over the submanifolds. Covariance estimation is made parametric, analogous to autoregressive modelling, by introducing small deformation linear operators for constraining the spectrum of the fields.}

Although much of the theorising is frankly speculative and not certain to survive without major modification, it sets new standards of rigour in its formal approach and is certain to have a stimulating effect upon the field. Sadly, Marr’s death from leukaemia at the age of 35 means that he will not himself be able to take part in the further development of his ideas, but the book itself will exert an important influence for some time to come. The first point to make, for those who may already have attempted Marr’s lengthy and difficult research papers, is that the book is clearly and entertainingly written: It can be tackled by the non-specialist who wishes to see why Marr’s work has caused such interest in the vision community. Despite the very difficult circumstances in which the book must have been written, it is carefully put together and gives a fascinating insight into the way in which the author’s ideas developed.}

abstract = {Abstract This study focuses on a simulation strategy that will allow the performance characteristics of an isolated gas turbine engine component, resolved from a detailed, high-fidelity analysis, to be transferred to an engine system analysis carried out at a lower level of resolution. The technique described in this paper is called ‘de-coupled’ high-fidelity analysis and utilizes an object-oriented, zero-dimensional gas turbine modelling and performance simulation system and a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) component model. The technique involves the generation of a component characteristic map without the parallel or iterative execution of the non-dimensional cycle and the three-dimensional CFD model. Therefore, a faster high-fidelity engine performance simulation can be achieved at run time. This paper demonstrates the ‘de-coupled’ approach to component high-fidelity analysis by using a three-dimensional CFD intake model of a high by-pass ratio turbofan as a case study. The CFD model is based on the geometry of the intake of the CFM56-5B2 engine. The CFD-generated performance map can fully define the characteristics of the intake at several operating conditions and power settings, and is subsequently used to provide a more accurate, physics-based estimate of intake performance (i.e. pressure recovery) and hence, engine performance, replacing the default, empirical values within the non-dimensional cycle model. A detailed comparison between the baseline engine performance (empirical pressure recovery) and the engine performance obtained after using the CFD-generated map is presented in this paper. The analysis carried out by this study demonstrates relative changes in the simulated engine performance > 1 per cent.}

abstract = {Increasingly, influencers are employed to market not only products but also ideas and beliefs. The far right has recognized the strategic potential of influencer communication to tap into new target groups and mobilize supporters. This paper provides insights into the little-explored field of far-right influencers. We conceptualize them as individual actors characterized by far-right ideology, positioned as political influencers, actively advocating for their ideological aims. Employing a multi-layered computational approach to explore communication practices and networking structures of 243 German-speaking far-right influencers on Telegram, we derive a typology and observe the emergence of a functionally differentiated influencer collective. In this collective, each community has specific functions and characteristics that emphasize different ideological aspects, mobilization modes, and influencer practices. Despite the decentralized organization, we find high efficiency in information dissemination. The results corroborate the assumed potential of far-right influencers as disseminators of ideological content who can be particularly persuasive through their role as parasocial opinion leaders.}

abstract = {Many new turbine designs may take large timelines to prove their worth. For getting duty condition at optimum efficiency, one can always scale speed, diameter, if a very efficient benchmark is available. This paper examines the similarity-based scaling strategy to develop radial inflow turbines for different compressible fluids from a well-established NASA radial flow turbine designed and experimentally tested with air as the working fluid. The NASA 1730 air turbine experimental data have been used as the benchmark here and adopted multiple fluids to understand scaling. The considered fluids are supercritical carbon dioxide for the Brayton cycle, helium for the cryogenic liquefaction cycle, and R143a for the organic Rankine cycle. The uniqueness here is to have three types of cycles, viz. closed-loop Brayton cycle, organic Rankine cycle, and cryogenic helium liquefaction cycle, which employ different working fluids, adapting the same NASA turbine geometry. This paper has described the scaling methodology and presented the simulated turbine performance of SCO2, helium, and R143a using computational fluid dynamics. The dimensionless curves for these fluids are plotted on the corresponding experimental characteristics of the NASA turbine. Out of the three fluids, SCO2 showed the perfect Mach number matching for the flow and torque coefficient curves. The Mach number deviations in the case of helium were small, and the variations were slightly higher for R143a. The efficiencies were the highest for R143a, followed by SCO2 and helium. Thus, the scaling was found to be effective in all cases. Thus, the standard turbomachinery space developed for air as fluid can be used effectively for the development of turboexpanders for various cycles with different working fluids without redesigning the entire shape using similarity-based scaling. The benchmark NASA 1730 turbine has proven this in three special cases. This paper is not against designing new machines but is only trying to say that when such good benchmark machines like NASA 1730 turbine is available; designers must use the power of similitude to adapt it to match new fluids and new conditions.}

abstract = {Most seabeds are unexplored and rich in mineral deposits, making offshore mining a promising activity. However, offshore operation brings in great challenges from technical equipment to physical space. For instance, an offshore agitated vessel is supposed to stabilize the solids concentration from the underwater mining and make little impact on the stability of the platform or ship. For this reason, we proposed a novel offshore agitated vessel. The whole system based on the arrangement of the mineral processing platform and the slurry mix flow rate is obtained from the previous design stage. Large-scale unsteady computational fluid dynamics simulations are performed to calculate its effectiveness. The simulation model equipped with two pitched blade turbines and inlets/outlets is investigated. A classical Eulerian multiphase model and a modification of the standard k-ε eddy-viscosity turbulence model are adopted to simulate the dense solid–liquid suspension dynamics. Computational fluid dynamics results were found to be in satisfactory agreement with the theoretical predictions. The agitated system obtained was found to be effective to stabilize the solid particle concentration. In order to achieve a higher concentration at outlets and lower power consumption, further improvement was made and validated by computational fluid dynamics simulations. The proposed offshore mechanical agitated vessel could be equipped on offshore mining.}
